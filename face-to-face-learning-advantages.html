                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the most oft-used terms after the pandemic is the term “new normal.” The new normal in education is the increased use of online learning tools. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered new ways of learning. All around the world, educational institutions are looking toward online learning platforms to continue with the process of educating students. The new normal now is a transformed concept of education with online learning at the core of this transformation. Today, digital learning has emerged as a necessary resource for students and schools all over the world. For many educational institutes, this is an entirely new way of education that they have had to adopt. Online learning is now applicable not just to learn academics but it also extends to learning extracurricular activities for students as well. In recent months, the demand for online learning has risen significantly, and it will continue doing so in the future.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) kinda hard</p><p>2) negative</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>During these hard times that the world is experiencing, it is easy to panic and get upset. Especially during the quarantine, when you feel isolated and very lonely. It may seem that your previous life would never return. Those negative thoughts and feelings can really get to you sometimes. I don’t know about you, but they certainly come to me.  </p><p>
</p><p>I am a bit worried about the new ways of teaching that the government considered necessary for social distancing. Adjusting to a new routine is hard.  I try to make my own schedule in order to stay productive.
</p><p>
</p><p>In this situation, the hardest thing for me is missing my friends, whom I have not seen for a long time. Probably many children are experiencing this feeling now. Something that helps me is contacting them online.</p><p>Since we moved to distance learning, most of all I'm glad that schooling hasn't stopped altogether and that in the future we will not have to learn the whole program at once.
</p><p>
</p><p>So far, lessons don't go as well as they once did in class. We often don't hear each other's voices. So when I ask a question, the teacher answers something different and I get nervous.
</p><p>
</p><p>The worst thing is that we have to study for four hours without breaks. After this I get headaches, but the teacher promises that this shortfall will be corrected. As for preparing home tasks, nothing has changed.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Discover Everything You Need To Know (Good And Bad) About  Online Education</p><p>One of the most oft-used terms after the pandemic is the term “new normal.” The new normal in education is the increased use of online learning tools. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered new ways of learning. All around the world, educational institutions are looking toward online learning platforms to continue with the process of educating students. The new normal now is a transformed concept of education with online learning at the core of this transformation. Today, digital learning has emerged as a necessary resource for students and schools all over the world. For many educational institutes, this is an entirely new way of education that they have had to adopt. Online learning is now applicable not just to learn academics but it also extends to learning extracurricular activities for students as well. In recent months, the demand for online learning has risen significantly, and it will continue doing so in the future.</p><p></p><p>As with most teaching methods, online learning also has its own set of positives and negatives. Decoding and understanding these positives and negatives will help institutes in creating strategies for more efficiently delivering the lessons, ensuring an uninterrupted learning journey for students</p><br />
