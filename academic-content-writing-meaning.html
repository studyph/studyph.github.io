By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

Need help pasagot po due today na kasi eh matinong sagot po sana nonsense reported, if di po alam wag nalang sumagot sayang po kasi yung points :&lt;DIRECTION: Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.SMART READINGStudents begin to read at an early age. By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English ______1. On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas post-graduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students ______2. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. ______3. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. _______4. If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as follows. Overseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their reading time is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies, apart from reading news about their own country, international news, and news about Britain, they probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio.  ________5. /from Academic Writing Course by R.R.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By planning carefully and following through on her daily and weekly goals, Crystal was able to fulfill one of her goals for the semester. Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.

</p><p>How does Crystal’s experience relate to your own post-secondary educational experience?
</p><p>
</p><p>To do well in the post-secondary environment, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of your studies to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new. In time, you will define your long-term goals more explicitly. Doing solid, steady work, day by day and week by week, will help you meet those goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Colloquial – Informal writing is similar to a spoken conversation.  Informal writing may include slang, figures of speech, broken syntax, asides and so on.  Informal writing takes a personal tone as if you were speaking directly to your audience (the reader). You can use the first or third person point of view (I and we), and you are likely to address the reader using second person (you and your).
</p><p>
</p><p>Simple – Short sentences are acceptable and sometimes essential to making a point in informal writing. There may be incomplete sentences or ellipsis(…) to make points.
</p><p>
</p><p>Contractions and Abbreviations – Words are likely to be simplified using contractions (for example, I’m, doesn’t, couldn’t, it’s) and abbreviations (e.g. TV, photos) whenever possible.
</p><p>
</p><p>Empathy and Emotion – The author can show empathy towards the reader regarding the complexity of a thought and help them through that complexity
