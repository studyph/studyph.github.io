A regular verb that ends in a consonant or a vowel other than e-, an -ed is added to the end of the word, and -d is added for the verbs that ends in -e. B. A regular verb formed its past tense by adding -d or -ed to the base form of the verb. C. A regular verb that ends in consonant plus -y, the letter -y is changed to -i before adding -ed. An example for this is the word “copy” that is changed to “copied”. D. A regular verb must have a suffix added to form their past tense ​</a>

Games may be classified in several ways. One of them is based on the number of players required as in solitaire games. The other classification is based on the purpose of playing. It can be found in gambling games when we watch race games, the games are classified based on the object of the game. Next, games can be classified by the people who play the games (as in children's games). Finally, games can be categorized by referring to the place they are played (as in lawn games). Many games fall into more than one of these categories, so the most common way of classifying games is by the equipment that is required to play them.

                            18. Teacher Liza the health coordinator of San Jose National High School, recorded the height of 40 students in a Grade10 class for computing Body Mass Index (BMI)Based on her report, Nadine's height is in the 60 percentile (P&amp;O) (Assume thatthe height of each student is different to each other.)a) How many students are shorter than Nodine?b) How many students are taller than Neone?c) If Kathryn's height is in the 3 quartie (Q.). how can you compare it with Nadine's heightd) If Maymay's height is in the 4 dece D.). how can you compare it with Nadine's height?e) If Maymay's height is in the 4 decie D)how can you compare </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a) This means that 60% of the students are shorter or equal to Nadine’s Height. In other words, 40 x 60% = 24 students are shorter or equal to Nadine’s Height.
</p><p>b) This means that 40% of the students are taller than Nadine’s Height. In other words, 40 x 40% = 16 students are taller than Nadine’s Height.
</p><p>c) Since 3rd quartile (3) is equal to 75th percentile (P75) then this means that Kathryn’s height is in the 75th percentile (P75) and Nadine height is in the 60th percentile (P60). In other words, Kathryn is taller than Nadine.
</p><p>d) Since 4th decile (4) is equal to 40th percentile (P40) then this means that Maymay’s height is in the 40th percentile (P40) and Nadine height is 60th percentile (P60). In other words, Maymay is shorter than Nadine.
</p><p>e) Since Maymay’s height is 40th percentile (P40) and Kathryn’s height is 75th percentile (P75) then this means that Maymay is shorter than Kathryn.</p><p></p><br />

Games may be classified in several ways. One of them is based on the number of players required as in solitaire games. The other classification is based on the purpose of playing. It can be found in gambling games when we watch race games, the games are classified based on the object of the game. Next, games can be classified by the people who play the games (as in children's games). Finally, games can be categorized by referring to the place they are played (as in lawn games). Many games fall into more than one of these categories, so the most common way of classifying games is by the equipment that is required to play them.
