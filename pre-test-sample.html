Read carefully the sample abstract of a research project and answer the questions that follow.ABSTRACTMathematics plays a huge role in our daily life. Through Mathematics, the complicated ideas of the world can be answered. Algebra, branch of Mathematics, is concerned with dealing equations pertaining to unknowns. Considering Algebra as one of the foundations of Mathematics, some students have hard time understandingthe concept So, the researchers developed a card game called CardGebra to help students improve their skills in solving algebra specifically linear equation in one variable. CardGebra is a multiplayer card game that uses linear equations as its mainconcept.This card game is introduced to Grade 8 students for five days. The researchers identified the common errors observed in the computation during the pretest.Results show that there is no significant difference between the pre-test and post test scores in the experimental group. Resulting to a p-value of 0.28, the null hypothesis is accepted. Based on the results of two-sample t-test, there is nosignificance between the post-test of the control and experimental group. Yielding a p-value of 0.35, the null hypothesis is accepted. However, using Cohen's d test, results show that a large effect size was observed between the post-test and pre-testscores. Overall, CardGebra is statistically ineffective on improving the skills in solvingalgebra but has developed skills in solving linear equations in one variable among students."CARDGEBRA, April 2019", Sayud, Gerald Michael P., Catempohan, Scott S., Sumbi, Reymar, San Remigio NHS1.

                                            IV. EVALUATION ASSESSMENT A. DIRECTION: Identify what type of quantitative research design is applicable for the following research questions. Write your answer in a sheet of paper. 1. Is there a correlation between socioeconomic status and managerial skills? 2. Do guidance counselors behave differently toward counselees of different genders? 3. What percent of high school graduates will pursue a career in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand? 4. Does technology-aided business generate more income than traditional business? 5. Is there a significant difference on the pre-test and post-test result of Grade 11 students in their aptitude test? B. Identify what type of random sampling technique were used on the following scenario. 1. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what study techniques their students are utilizing Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10 students from each of the sections to comprise their sample. 2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes all the inmates in those three prisons in her sample 3. Say you wanted to survey professors at KBU about their publication records. You want to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones. 4. Say you were interested in sampling students who deal drugs on campus. What sampling technique could you use to build this sample? 5. What is the best sampling technique to use for determining the average speed of the cars on a section of highway?​</a>

                            8. WHAT'S NEWREAD AND RESPOND. Read carefully the sample abstract of a research project and answer the questions that follow.ABSTRACTMathematics plays a huge role in our daily life. Through Mathematics, the complicated ideas of the world can be answered. Algebra, branch of Mathematics, is concerned with dealing equations pertaining to unknowns. Considering Algebra as one of the foundations of Mathematics, some students have hard time understandingthe concept So, the researchers developed a card game called CardGebra to help students improve their skills in solving algebra specifically linear equation in one variable. CardGebra is a multiplayer card game that uses linear equations as its mainconcept.This card game is introduced to Grade 8 students for five days. The researchers identified the common errors observed in the computation during the pretest.Results show that there is no significant difference between the pre-test and post test scores in the experimental group. Resulting to a p-value of 0.28, the null hypothesis is accepted. Based on the results of two-sample t-test, there is nosignificance between the post-test of the control and experimental group. Yielding a p-value of 0.35, the null hypothesis is accepted. However, using Cohen's d test, results show that a large effect size was observed between the post-test and pre-testscores. Overall, CardGebra is statistically ineffective on improving the skills in solvingalgebra but has developed skills in solving linear equations in one variable among students."CARDGEBRA, April 2019", Sayud, Gerald Michael P., Catempohan, Scott S., Sumbi, Reymar, San Remigio NHS1.
