Researchers are hoping to get emergency approval from regulators, whichwould allow them to make millions of vaccines by the fall. Oxford vaccines, thosewere effective over the last year, involved trials on macaque monkeys. Oxfordscientists hope to conduct thousands of clinical trials in the coming weeks; however,scientists are not sure that humans have the same immunity as monkeys. Sometimesit takes years to develop a vaccine and to make it available for patients. In case of avaccine for COVID-19, health officials have suggested that it could take between 12to 18 months.Summary OrganizerSomeoneWantsButSoThenSummary:make it summarize the story?​</a>

</p>Roger: Good Morning Ma’am!...I would like to thank you for giving me that money (while showing his shoes)
Mrs. Jones: I see, you have bought it! Good for you young man

</p>Mrs. Jones: young man, Aren’t you awfully familiar?
Roger: Yes, Ma’am I was the boy you gave money to buy a pair of blue suede shoes.
Roger: And I would like to return the money to you. ( hands over the ten dollars)
Roger: <strong>Thank you, Ma’am</strong>.
<p></p>A Year later:
<p>The boy kept the money until unknowingly a year had almost passed since then. He is now older and had his ways straightened to good. He were to return to Mrs. Jones and return the money.
</p>Roger: Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones? I have come here to return the money you lend me about a year later.
Mrs. Jones: Why aren’t you that young boy who had a face full of dirt?
Roger: I sure am Ma’am…And I would like to properly thank you for helping me straighten my values that day.

Oxfordscientists hope to conduct thousands of clinical trials in the coming weeks; however,scientists are not sure that humans have the same immunity as monkeys.

                        <p><strong>My Pandemic Salvation Story</strong></p><p>you've likely heard individuals say "we as a whole are in almost the same situation" to depict how <strong>COVID-19</strong> has changed our lives. Be that as it may, assuming we're being straightforward, the novel<strong> Covid</strong> has affected us all in inconceivably various ways. Certain individuals lost positions, while vocations in medical services inclined up significantly. A few houses are humming with kids home from school without any exercises to join in, while different homes are horrendously tranquil and desolate. A few of us are living in outrageous dread, and others are unburdened by the danger of medical problems.

Regardless of where you observe yourself today, we trust one of these stanzas contacts you in your accurate circumstance and season.
</p><p>Here we have accumulated Bible sections about isolation in the midst of the <strong>Coronavirus</strong> episode for those looking for a scriptural viewpoint on these turbulent occasions. There are various accounts of isolation in the <strong>Bible</strong> when individuals were told by <strong>God to remain protected</strong> at home during sicknesses and illness. In sacred text, God would at times send a "anger" of illness and demise to rebuff the individuals who had gone to ways of life of wrongdoing and worshipful admiration. Sacred writing told individuals of God to "conceal yourselves for a<strong> brief period</strong> until his fierceness has cruised by." Read through these Bible refrains on isolation to more readily comprehend the scriptural accounts of infection and their pertinence today.</p><p>My Pandemic Salvation Story ://brainly.ph/question/2271899</p><p>#LETSSTUDY </p><p></p><br />

</p><p>1. My baby has been missing for over a month now, and I want him back so badly," said Mrs Brown, a fifty-six-year-old woman </p><p></p><p>MY CONNECTIONS: Text-to-self </p><p>This story reminds me of my mother who was always worried about her children and who always missed her children. She would always call us to remind us to stay safe and always eat on time. She was indeed the most thoughtful mom we ever could have and if I have to choose my mother in my next life, I would still want her.
