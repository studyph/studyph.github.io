The number in parentheses below tells you how many signal words are found in the selection. Along with food production, human beings found time to develop the arts and sciences. Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

For the first four days I was completely alone. I don’t think I even spoke to a single person. Finally, at lunch on the fifth day, Karen Watson approached me and sat down next to me. Even though I was new, I had already figured out who Karen Watson was. She was popular. Pretty soon all of Karen’s friends were sitting right there next to me. I never became great friends with Karen, but after that, it seemed like all sorts of people started becoming my friend. You cannot convince me that Karen did not know what she was doing. I have a great respect for her and I learned a lot about what a true leader is. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA. NarrativeB. Process.C. DescriptiveD.

In the bowl was hidden something that was not so pure, however, the irresistible indulgence was worth every calorie that I knew it contained. As I looked inside I saw on the bottom of the bowl a hot, tender brownie loaded with macadamia nuts. I knew from past experience that the nuts had a creamy and smooth texture, almost like white chocolate. On top of the brownie were two firmly packed scoops of ice cream, laying side by side, each one a different flavor. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA.

                            1. How did the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect changing global priorities and challenges, and what were some of the key differences between these two frameworks for international development?​ASAP</h2><br />
                        <p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were a set of eight global development goals established by the United Nations in 2000, with a deadline of 2015. The MDGs were focused on reducing poverty, improving health and education, and promoting gender equality, among other areas.</p><p></p><p>However, the MDGs were criticized for being too narrow in scope and lacking a comprehensive approach to sustainable development. In response to these criticisms, the United Nations launched a process to develop a new framework for international development, which culminated in the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015.</p><p></p><p>The SDGs build on the progress made by the MDGs, but also address some of the gaps and weaknesses of the previous framework. For example, the SDGs have a much broader scope, covering 17 goals and 169 targets, compared to the MDGs' eight goals and 21 targets. The SDGs also aim to be more inclusive and participatory, with a focus on engaging stakeholders at all levels, including civil society, the private sector, and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>One of the key differences between the MDGs and the SDGs is the emphasis on sustainability and the environment. While the MDGs did not explicitly address issues such as climate change and environmental degradation, the SDGs recognize the interdependence of economic, social, and environmental sustainability, and aim to promote sustainable development in all its dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Another important difference is the recognition of the role of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. The SDGs emphasize the need for collaboration among governments, civil society, the private sector, and other stakeholders, and encourage the sharing of knowledge, expertise, and resources.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs reflects changing global priorities and challenges, as well as a more comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainable development. The SDGs provide a framework for addressing the complex and interconnected challenges facing the world today, and for building a more equitable, sustainable, and resilient future for all.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The atoms and molecules in gases are much more spread out than in solids or liquids. They vibrate and move freely at high speeds. A gas will fill any container, but if the container is not sealed, the gas will escape. Gas can be compressed much more easily than a liquid or solid.</p><p></p><p>5.Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matter's chemical makeup or chemical properties. Common changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and vaporization. These changes are shown in Figure below.</p><p></p><br />

A fact can be checked with a set of evidence such as the ewspapers, journals, a scholarly website among others. 2. Genre is a French word which means 'kind' or 'type' and is a way of categorizing films and TV programmes 3. Negative message is a type of communication that provides good news, acceptance, encouragement or congratulations. 4. An opinion is a pure point of view or belief 5. Pessimistic messages are rejections or discouragements that can create a hardship for a person emotionally. 6. Comparison words signal that the author is pointing out a similarity between two subjects. 7. Transition words indicate building up new idea or thought or compare ideas or draw conclusions 8. Similar words tell you that the author is pointing out a difference between two subjects or statements 9. Subtle word choice changes can have a big effect on the overall tone of a message. 10.

The number in parentheses below tells you how many signal words are found in the selection. Along with food production, human beings found time to develop the arts and sciences. Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

Write the signal words in the box below and tell whether it shows emphasis, addition, comparison, contrast, illustration, consequence, or cause-and-effect. The number in parentheses below tells you how many signal words are found in the selection. Along with food production, human beings found time to develop the arts and sciences. Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>How are transition signals used?
</p><p>
</p><p>•     Transition signals are usually placed at the start of sentences; however, they may also appear in the middle or end of sentences.
</p><p>
</p><p>•     A transition signal, or the clause introduced by a transition signal, is usually separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.
</p><p>
</p><p>•     You DO NOT need to use transition signals in every sentence in a paragraph; however, good use of transition words will help to make the relationship between the ideas in your writing clear and logical.
</p><p>
</p><p>Which transition signals can I use?
</p><p>
</p><p>Before choosing a particular transition signal to use, be sure you understand its meaning and usage completely and be sure that it's the right match for the logic in your paper. Transition signals all have different meanings, nuances, and connotations.

I have a great respect for her and I learned a lot about what a true leader is. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA. NarrativeB. Process.C. DescriptiveD.

On top of the brownie were two firmly packed scoops of ice cream, laying side by side, each one a different flavor. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA.
