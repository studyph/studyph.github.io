                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Mechanics of Volleyball:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>Volleyball is one of the world's most popular sports and is played by more than 800 million people on the planet at least once a week. The game of volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a teacher at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He combined parts of tennis, baseball, basketball and handball to create a new game to be played indoors by people who wanted less physical contact than basketball. Morgan borrowed the net from tennis and raised it six feet, six inches above the floor, a little higher than an average man's head.</p><p></p><p><strong>Rules:</strong></p><p>When volleyball was first invented, it was much different from the game today. You could have as many players as you wanted on each team. There were nine innings per game, with three outs per innning. There was also no limit on the number of hits of the ball on each side of the court. Here are the basic rules of volleyball today.</p><p></p>Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on a court divided by a net.The object of the game is to send the ball over the net so that the opposing team cannot return the ball or prevent it from hitting the ground in their court.Each team has three hits to attempt to return the ball.The ball is put in play by a serve that is hit by the server over the net to the opponent.When the receiving team wins a volley, it gains the right to serve, and the players rotate one position clockwise.When the serving team wins a volley, it wins a point and the right to continue serving.The ball must clear the net on a serve.A game is played to 21 points or some other agreed upon number. The team that wins the best two out of three games wins the match.<p></p><p><strong>Terms and Lingo:</strong></p>Ace - When the ball is served to the other team and no one touches it.Sideout - When the team that served the ball makes a mistake, causing the ball to go to the other team.Roof - When a player jumps above the height of the net and blocks the ball.Dig - When a player makes a save from a very difficult spike.Kill - When a team spikes the ball and it ends in either a point or a sideout.<p></p><strong>Pa-Brainliest po Please!</strong> <br />

                            30. Nancy needs at least 1000 gigabytes of storage to take pictures and videos on her upcoming vacation. She checks and finds that she has 105GB available on her phone. She plans on buying additional memory cards to get the rest of the storage she needs.
The cheapest memory cards she can find each hold 256GB and cost $10. She wants to spend as little money as possible and still get the storage she needs.
Let C represent the number of memory cards that Nancy buys.
What inequality best describes this scenario?</h2><br />
