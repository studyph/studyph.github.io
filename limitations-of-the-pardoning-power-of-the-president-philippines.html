                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Article VII, Section 1, of the 1987 Constitution vests executive power on the President of the Philippines. The President is the Head of State and Head of Government, and functions as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. As chief executive, the President exercises control over all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices.</p><p></p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES</p><p>The President of the Philippines is elected by direct vote by the people for a term of six years.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>President Biden is exploring the use of his clemency power for individuals on home confinement under the CARES Act for non-violent drug offenses.  Currently, the expedited screening program is only for those drug offenders on home confinement who have between 18 and 48 months remaining on their sentences.  The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has been asked to notify eligible offenders of the program so that they may file a petition to initiate consideration of clemency by The President.  Once the clemency petition and other necessary materials are assembled and evaluated by the Pardon Attorney, the Department of Justice will make its recommendation on the clemency request to The President.  Please note that the Department of Justice will continue to consider clemency cases where an offender has a pending motion for compassionate release in any district court if the commutation petition is being considered under the parameters of the expedited screening program.  The Office of the Pardon Attorney is unable to provide additional information or clarification about the expedited home confinement screening program, so additional questions should be routed to The White House Office of Public Affairs. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>The answer is executive privilege. </strong>Executive privilege is the sacred rule that allows the president and abnormal state official branch officers to withhold data from Congress, the courts, and eventually people in general.

Early last week, the president granted him pardon and he has since been deported from the country. Since this surprising decision of the president, there have been many discussions on the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and its implications for the country, and the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) Law which was used to justify the release of the Marine, after the court credited him more than 1,000 days as a result of supposedly good behavior inside the prison, even before the grant of pardon</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>YES. Yes, the President can grant conditional pardon to Pedro Ramirez even in the absence of a favorable recommendation from the DND Secretary. Assuming that Pedro Ramirez's conviction has become final in the court and if the case is still pending, pardon cannot be given as it presupposes finality of judgement.</p><p>The 1987 Constitution, specifically Section 19 of Article VII and Section 5 of Article IX-C, provides that the President of the Philippines possesses the power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency, to wit: <strong>Section 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.</strong></p><p>In addition, Section 5 provides that: <strong>"No pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules, and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission."</strong></p><p>It is apparent from the foregoing constitutional provisions that the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be in: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. </p><p>Absence of favorable recommendation from the DND Secretary is not one of the ground provided by the constitution, for the non-exercise of such Executive Discretion. The power to pardon, when exercised by the Chief Executive in favor of persons convicted of public crimes, is plenary, limited only by the terms of the Constitution; its exercise within these limits is otherwise absolute and fully discretionary. </p><p>In addition, a person granted a conditional pardon is required to abide by the limits and guidelines imposed. He or she is also required to be under the supervision of a pardon officer. Non-compliance shall result in the revocation of the pardon.</p><br />
