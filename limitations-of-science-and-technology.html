                                            please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</a>

                                            Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</a>

How did this development in science and technology shaped human history? Be specific about what scientific and technological development created an impact on your daily life.  Strictly limit your answers to a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 8 sentences only.​</h2><br />
                        <p>One major scientific and technological development that has had a significant impact on human history is the Internet. The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and conduct business. It has made it possible for people from different parts of the world to connect and share ideas in real-time, regardless of geographical boundaries. The internet has also given rise to the digital economy, which has transformed industries and created new job opportunities.</p><p></p><p>The internet has also enabled the development of other technological advancements, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. These innovations have brought about further changes in the way people live and work, as they allow for more efficient and effective ways of doing things. For example, the internet has made it possible for people to work remotely, which has become more important during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, the use of mobile phones has also had a significant impact on daily life. Mobile phones have made it possible for people to stay connected with their loved ones and conduct business on the go. The rise of mobile internet has also made it possible for people to access information and services using their phones. This has given rise to new industries, such as mobile banking and mobile e-commerce.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the development of science and technology has had a profound impact on human history, shaping the way people live, work, and communicate. From the Internet to mobile phones, these advancements have made life more convenient and connected, while also presenting new challenges and opportunities for society.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>convictions. Knowing who you are allows you to live your life with purpose and meaning.</p><p></p><p>2. A narrow focus brings big results. The number one reason people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they have come. But it's a series of small wins that can give us the most significant success.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Show up fully. Don't dwell on the past, and don't daydream about the future, but concentrate on showing up fully in the present moment.</p><p></p><p>4. Don't make assumptions. If you don't know the situation fully, you can't offer an informed opinion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5. Be patient and persistent. Life is not so much what you accomplish as what you overcome. </p><p></p><p>6. In order to get, you have to give. If you support, guide, and lead others, if you make contributions to their lives, you will reap the best rewards.</p><p></p><p>7. Luck comes from hard work. Luck happens when hard work and timing and talent intersect.</p><p></p><p>8. Be your best at all times. You never know what the future will bring, so always make the best use of the present.</p><p></p><p>9. Don't try to impress everyone. The unhappiest people are those who care the most about what other people think.</p><p></p><p>10. Don't be afraid of being afraid. Sometimes the one thing you need for growth is the one thing you are most afraid to do.</p><p></p><p></p><p>11.  Listen to learn. Learn how to listen. You can't learn anything when you're talking.</p><p></p><p>12. Life's good, but it's not fair. The delusion that life's supposed to be fair is the source of much unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>13. No task is beneath you. Don't put yourself above anyone or anything; work hard in silence and let success make the noise.</p><p></p><p>14. You can't always get what you want. But, as the song says, if you try you may find you get what you need.</p><p></p><p>15. Don't make decisions when you are angry or ecstatic. The best decisions are made with a clear conscious mind, not in the throes of any emotion--positive or negative.</p><p></p><p>16. Don't worry what other people think. Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud.</p><p></p><p></p><p>17. Use adversity as an opportunity. Every loss leads to an opportunity, and every adversity leads to new possibilities.</p><p></p><p>18. Do what is right, not what is easy. Strength of character leads us to do the right thing, even when there are easier options.</p><p></p><p>19. Dreams remain dreams until you take action. Without action, an idea is just a dream.</p><p></p><p>20. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Do right. Do your best. Treat others as you would want them to treat you.</p><p></p><p>21. When you quit, you fail. The surest way to lose at any endeavor is to quit. But fatigue, discomfort, and discouragement are merely symptoms of effort. </p><p></p><p>22. Trust your instincts. What good is intuition if you let second-guessing drown it out? The worst enemy of success is self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>23. Learn something new every day. Have the mindset of a student. Never think you are too old to ask questions or know too much to learn something new.</p><p></p><p>24. Make what is valuable important. Instead of thinking about what is profitable, think about what is valuable. Invest in others and you will grow your portfolio.</p><br />

                            19. please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</h2><br />

                            21. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p>1.) In Science, limits and continuity are important because they allow us to make predictions about physical phenomena by understanding how variables behave as they approach certain values. For example, the concept of limits is used in the study of rates of change, which is crucial in physics and chemistry.<p></p>2.) In Technology, limits and continuity are important because they enable us to design and optimize systems with complex behaviors. Understanding the limits of a system helps us identify potential problems and develop solutions, while continuity helps ensure that the system behaves smoothly and predictably.<p></p>3.) In Engineering, limits and continuity are important because they form the foundation of mathematical modeling, which is essential in designing and optimizing systems. Engineers use limits and continuity to analyze the behavior of complex systems and make predictions about their performance.<p></p>4.) In Mathematics, limits and continuity are important because they are fundamental concepts that underlie much of calculus and analysis. They form the basis for understanding derivatives, integrals, and other advanced mathematical concepts, and are essential for many branches of mathematics, including analysis, topology, and differential equations.<br />
