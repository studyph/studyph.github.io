                                            ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</a>

                                            TAMAYO BEAUTY SALON After finishing a cosmetology course with hair culture in 2005 at the Ricky and David School of Beauty in Santa Rosa City, Miss Rosemarie Tamayo decided to put up a salon business. Miss Tamayo worked with a local beauty parlor. In charge of income, her efforts made a significant contribution to the improvement of the salon's gross revenue. After two years, she thought that her career was at a dead-end, so she moved to a new business. She put up a new business such as massage and spa in the same locality. Her new line of business gives her a chance to meet prominent families in the community. This exposed her to the entrepreneurial spirit prevalent among local businesspeople. She witnessed how simple-looking folk became prosperous in a short period.Miss Tamayo thought that she had better chances in the massage and spa business. After three years, the firm's average monthly sales were P150,000. Except for the manual labor provided by her three hairdressers, Miss Tamayo was personally handling every facet of the spa and massage activity, from purchasing raw materials to actual delivery of service to the customers.In spite her initial success, Miss Tamayo dreamed of running a bigger place. She thought that if she would have to grow, she must increase her output in terms of market share. It was very timely because the customers were already complaining about the very limited hairdressers and masseuses. As if to add to her burden, a friend from a nearby town asked if she can offer a franchise. The foregoing developments led Miss Tamayo to consider hiring more persons. However, she was at loss on what exact assistance she wanted, making her recruitment activities a little difficult.  From the situation above, develop a marketing strategy for the business. Use additional short coupon bond. First,​</a>

                                            pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

c. What steps in implementing Statistical Process Control (SPC) should Solar Cell 
Manufacturer apply in order to succeed in the initiative?III. Areas of Consideration

                                            Case Analysis: Rem Apparel: Alice Blue Gown For the past 13 years, Ms. Remedios Olay operated her clothing shop located in the middle of the city's commercial district. Her merchandise consists of apparel for men and women. Under her employ are six salesladies. Her shop opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM. Among the clothing stores in the city, her shop is the most successful. The recent opening of two giant malls did not affect the viability of her firm. Many people are amazed at the outstanding performance of Ms. Olay's shop: The Rem Apparel. Ms. Olay' s success can be attributed to her skill in defining what the customers really want to buy from her. The products she displays in her shop are considered elegant and stylish by her customers, most of whom are professionals and middle level business and government executives. She continued enjoying the patronage of her customers until one of her major suppliers ceased operating due to the failing health of its owner. Ms. Olay got worried and she began to consider manufacturing her own requirements. She started to make preliminary moves to operate an apparel manufacturing business. Her first step was to hire an assistant who will initially help her prepare the necessary documents to purchase a suitable lot where the factory will be located. Her next move was to send her brightest employee to enroll in an apparel designing course in a reputable vocational school in Manila. In addition to her other experiences, the chosen employee had worked as a seamstress for three years in a tailoring shop. Ms. Olay is so enthusiastic, and she plans to start operating within two years.</a>

                            12. ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</h2><br />

                            16. TAMAYO BEAUTY SALON After finishing a cosmetology course with hair culture in 2005 at the Ricky and David School of Beauty in Santa Rosa City, Miss Rosemarie Tamayo decided to put up a salon business. Miss Tamayo worked with a local beauty parlor. In charge of income, her efforts made a significant contribution to the improvement of the salon's gross revenue. After two years, she thought that her career was at a dead-end, so she moved to a new business. She put up a new business such as massage and spa in the same locality. Her new line of business gives her a chance to meet prominent families in the community. This exposed her to the entrepreneurial spirit prevalent among local businesspeople. She witnessed how simple-looking folk became prosperous in a short period.Miss Tamayo thought that she had better chances in the massage and spa business. After three years, the firm's average monthly sales were P150,000. Except for the manual labor provided by her three hairdressers, Miss Tamayo was personally handling every facet of the spa and massage activity, from purchasing raw materials to actual delivery of service to the customers.In spite her initial success, Miss Tamayo dreamed of running a bigger place. She thought that if she would have to grow, she must increase her output in terms of market share. It was very timely because the customers were already complaining about the very limited hairdressers and masseuses. As if to add to her burden, a friend from a nearby town asked if she can offer a franchise. The foregoing developments led Miss Tamayo to consider hiring more persons. However, she was at loss on what exact assistance she wanted, making her recruitment activities a little difficult.  From the situation above, develop a marketing strategy for the business.

                            18. pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                            26. Case Analysis: Rem Apparel: Alice Blue Gown For the past 13 years, Ms. Remedios Olay operated her clothing shop located in the middle of the city's commercial district. Her merchandise consists of apparel for men and women. Under her employ are six salesladies. Her shop opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM. Among the clothing stores in the city, her shop is the most successful. The recent opening of two giant malls did not affect the viability of her firm. Many people are amazed at the outstanding performance of Ms. Olay's shop: The Rem Apparel. Ms. Olay' s success can be attributed to her skill in defining what the customers really want to buy from her. The products she displays in her shop are considered elegant and stylish by her customers, most of whom are professionals and middle level business and government executives. She continued enjoying the patronage of her customers until one of her major suppliers ceased operating due to the failing health of its owner. Ms. Olay got worried and she began to consider manufacturing her own requirements. She started to make preliminary moves to operate an apparel manufacturing business. Her first step was to hire an assistant who will initially help her prepare the necessary documents to purchase a suitable lot where the factory will be located. Her next move was to send her brightest employee to enroll in an apparel designing course in a reputable vocational school in Manila. In addition to her other experiences, the chosen employee had worked as a seamstress for three years in a tailoring shop. Ms. Olay is so enthusiastic, and she plans to start operating within two years.</h2><br />
