                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The positive effect in globalization brings wealth and foreign currency to local economies while the negative effects are terrorism, job insecurity, currency fluctuation, and price instability.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p>Negative effects:<br /><br />The widening of the gap between the rich and poor people, a result of globalization, puts the Philippines deeper in the quicksand of poverty and also causes social injustices among men. The deprivation of jobs and resources from its own citizens causes the people to die unattended.<br /><br />Positive Effects:<br /><br />According to the disciplining hypothesis, globalization restrains governments by inducing increased budgetary pressure. As a consequence, governments shift their expenditures in favour of transfers and subsidies and away from capital expenditures.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Positive:</strong>
</p><p>
</p>Increased peace in the world. It’s now clear that trading with someone is way more lucrative than conquering them.
Increased international cooperation, often (but unfortunately not always) in the interests of human kind. For example the Human Genome Project, fusion research (ITER), etc.
Huge reduction in poverty from nearly 99% in absolute poverty to under 10% in under a century!
Accelerated technological development through market forces of demand and supply and opening up labor markets,
Cultural diffusion and access to markets. For example, more food choices. Food, music, activities.<p></p><p><strong>Negative:</strong>
</p>Inequality, both domestic and international, because of insufficient protections against exploitation. I say this is well worth the price.
For some countries the loss of domestic industry, which has benefited developing nations immensely (including mine), but I am of the opinion that the paramount interests that policies and resources of a nation should serve are that of its citizens
Environmental degradationImperative need for stronger international authorities, like the UN, which will be difficult even on a theoretical level. For example:
Every country should be free to reject or assent to increased UN authority.
But if we create a system of plurality voting, then the wealthier countries which tend to have smaller populations would find no advantage to this, and refuse.
If it’s one nation one vote, like the current scheme, then nations with disproportionately large amount of resources like the US, China, Japan, might not agree taking the majority for the burden of a higher authority while only receiving the same voting power as everyone else.
If it’s the current system + the security council, then you’ve created a system where the most democratic institution (UNGA) has 0 formal power, and the least democratic (UNSC) becomes a deadlocked forum of endless disagreements.<p>      5. Globalization is established under a set of rules when many nations didn’t even exist yet, but under international law, are bound to its rules by default.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><br />
