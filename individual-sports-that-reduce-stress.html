                        THE BEST ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE STRESS<p>It's critical to have a positive relationship with the sport you chose if you want to use it to <strong>relieve stress.</strong> In other words, you should take it easy and not push yourself too much. You feel better and restore control with the aid of a brief, gentle workout. If you choose a sport or training regimen because you are extremely competitive or push yourself too hard, there are no benefits to it. Finding out how much exercise you need to relax is the key.</p><p></p><strong>Running</strong><p>Since running is one of the earliest abilities we develop, many experts advise it. In order to prevent overtaxing your body, it's crucial to maintain an <strong>aerobic </strong>range (where your breathing quickens but you aren't out of breath).</p><p></p><strong>Walks</strong><p>Regular, brief walks in addition to endurance activities can help lower stress levels.</p><p></p><strong>Yoga</strong><p>Another great method to unwind is through yoga. You start meditating when you pay attention to your breathing.</p><p></p><strong>Team sports</strong><p>Team sports like soccer are a terrific way to decompress if you spend a lot of time alone, whether at work or in your personal time. Never undervalue the assistance a social network may offer. Working as a team fosters self-confidence and helps lower stress levels.</p><p></p><strong>Self-defense</strong><p>Self-defense increases your body awareness, which enhances coordination and helps you stay balanced. Additionally, you'll feel more self-assured because poor self-esteem might raise your stress levels.</p><p></p><strong>Climbing</strong><p>Climbing and other outdoor, fresh air sports give you a better sense of <strong>independence</strong>. You develop the ability to stay focused and avoid being sidetracked.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about sports</p><p>brainly.ph/question/2254325</p><p>#SPJ6</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Even when you compete for yourself, you still benefit from the support of coaches and teammates. Coaches share their expertise to help you to train and develop to your furthest potential. They guide your workouts and provide encouragement. And teammates give you a competitive edge. They help you set goals, breed healthy competition, and challenge you to work harder.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Individual sports take mental toughness. They demand you set personal goals, manage stress, build self-confidence, and develop focus. Team sports build comradery and group empathy, but it takes a strong mindset to compete—at any level—alone on the court. These hurdles, once conquered, make the benefits of individual sports plentiful.</p><p></p><p>Consider swimming for example. You determine your goals in the water. Do you focus on your stroke or how many laps you want to swim? The water shuts out the world, leaving you with only your stroke and your thoughts. Left without distractions (earbuds or a monitor to watch), this is a good time to focus on yourself and explore why you’re swimming in the first place.</p><p></p><p>The challenge is to find the mental toughness to keep swimming—digging deep for inner motivation. It’s important to identify why you’re competing and how to improve your performance. Personal goals can range from setting a world record to improving upon last week’s swim.</p><p></p><p>Let’s take a deep dive into individual sports, how they develop mental toughness, and the ways error management benefits your performance.</p><br />
