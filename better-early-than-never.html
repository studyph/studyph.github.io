Then answer the questions.A dirty-yellow sky had threatened rain all day and a hollow stillness hung over the valley. Mother went to the field and gathered the last cucumbers and tomatoes. As she approached the house, she heard a frightening noise in a brush pile near the steps. Peering into the pile. she glimpsed a terrifying creature - a huge black monster with green head and giant green fangs. Mother's hands shook as she came up the steps dumped her apron and reached for her hoe. "Joe," she said struggling to steady her voice, "you go get Mr. Riley. "Jeanne, you stay in the house. I'm going out to stand guard at the brush pile until Mr. Riley gets here." It seemed an eternity before Mr. Riley arrived, scooped mother to one side, and pointed his shotgun into the brush pile. Then, quite suddenly, he lowered the gun and leaned down to take a better look."Is that your monster?" he asked mother gently, smiling and pointing into the brush. "Come here," he said. "And look closely at an ordinary black snake whose appetite is bigger than his mouth. That's a huge green frog, stuck half in and half out of his mouth. Those fangs are the frog's legs."That was when mother finally broke. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she slumped forward. But Mr. Riley moved quickly enough to catch her small collapsing figure. And right then I knew that things could never be the same again.As thunder pierced the hollow stillness, I looked at mother and suddenly knew her secret. She was desperately afraid - and had been all along - of the foxes. the hawks, the snakes. But she had faced them anyway!

                                            A Country Boy Quits School By Lao Hsiang SUMMARY The story is about a poor Chinese family which has a boy of an early age, toiling everyday for a living just to help augmenting the other basic needs of their family. The family is forced to send this boy to school following a city ordinance. To cite. An official prodamation had been issued in the city to the effect that unless a boy over six years of age is sent to school, some adult in the family will go to jail Good thing there is a law that compels this boy to study so that it could have been a chance for him to acquire knowledge too but soon- er or later he misses that mere chance due to the intervention of his family's poor insight. The English illustrations in books and the literal meaning they for translation lead much using confusion ard misunderstanding in their household which everyone is holding grudges against each other, which in fact without basis at all because their judgment is only based on their own unreasonable perception, which the true intention of the content of the books is the other way around. The intention is for the betterment of the reader's life. As the boy studies he frequently reads these books at the top of his lungs and it brings discomfort to the ears of every family member every time they hear this due to their own inaccurate interpretation of the foreign system of education. This incident always results to chaos and misunderstanding so that one day the father decided that these books will never be read again by the boy because his family is certain that the school is not teaching the proper way so the boy is finally pulled out of the school in which the father chooses to be rather in jail than destroying the family for continuously sending a boy to school. It only demonstrates that the entire family lacks in education itself because there is no doubt that they are seeing things differently which is out of context. Comprehension Questions 1. Who are the main characters in the story? 2. What common character traits of these personalities contributed to the conflict in the story? 3.

As a father of a grown-up daughter, he immediately gives joyfulpermission to marry Natalia.She is invited into the room. Lomov becomes nervous, and instead of putting his proposal, he begins tobeat around the bush. When he says that his Ox Meadows touch her birch woods, she begins to argue withhim about the ownership of that piece of land. After her father notices they are arguing, he joins in and thensends Lomov out of the house. Choobookov then tells his daughter that Lomov was there to propose to her.Natalia repents and asks her father to call him back. Lomov comes, and she asks him about his huntingprogram. He says that he will start hunting after harvest because his best dog has gone lame. At this point,Natalia contradicts him again and claims that her dog Leap is better than his dog Guess.

                            5. Grade 7 Reading Comprehension TextMy Motherby Jeanne HillRead the passage. Then answer the questions.A dirty-yellow sky had threatened rain all day and a hollow stillness hung over the valley. Mother went to the field and gathered the last cucumbers and tomatoes. As she approached the house, she heard a frightening noise in a brush pile near the steps. Peering into the pile. she glimpsed a terrifying creature - a huge black monster with green head and giant green fangs. Mother's hands shook as she came up the steps dumped her apron and reached for her hoe. "Joe," she said struggling to steady her voice, "you go get Mr. Riley. "Jeanne, you stay in the house. I'm going out to stand guard at the brush pile until Mr. Riley gets here." It seemed an eternity before Mr. Riley arrived, scooped mother to one side, and pointed his shotgun into the brush pile. Then, quite suddenly, he lowered the gun and leaned down to take a better look."Is that your monster?" he asked mother gently, smiling and pointing into the brush. "Come here," he said. "And look closely at an ordinary black snake whose appetite is bigger than his mouth. That's a huge green frog, stuck half in and half out of his mouth. Those fangs are the frog's legs."That was when mother finally broke. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she slumped forward. But Mr. Riley moved quickly enough to catch her small collapsing figure. And right then I knew that things could never be the same again.As thunder pierced the hollow stillness, I looked at mother and suddenly knew her secret. She was desperately afraid - and had been all along - of the foxes. the hawks, the snakes. But she had faced them anyway!

                            14. A Country Boy Quits School By Lao Hsiang SUMMARY The story is about a poor Chinese family which has a boy of an early age, toiling everyday for a living just to help augmenting the other basic needs of their family. The family is forced to send this boy to school following a city ordinance. To cite. An official prodamation had been issued in the city to the effect that unless a boy over six years of age is sent to school, some adult in the family will go to jail Good thing there is a law that compels this boy to study so that it could have been a chance for him to acquire knowledge too but soon- er or later he misses that mere chance due to the intervention of his family's poor insight. The English illustrations in books and the literal meaning they for translation lead much using confusion ard misunderstanding in their household which everyone is holding grudges against each other, which in fact without basis at all because their judgment is only based on their own unreasonable perception, which the true intention of the content of the books is the other way around. The intention is for the betterment of the reader's life. As the boy studies he frequently reads these books at the top of his lungs and it brings discomfort to the ears of every family member every time they hear this due to their own inaccurate interpretation of the foreign system of education. This incident always results to chaos and misunderstanding so that one day the father decided that these books will never be read again by the boy because his family is certain that the school is not teaching the proper way so the boy is finally pulled out of the school in which the father chooses to be rather in jail than destroying the family for continuously sending a boy to school. It only demonstrates that the entire family lacks in education itself because there is no doubt that they are seeing things differently which is out of context. Comprehension Questions 1.
