                                            Development of the Periodic Table1817, the development of the periodic table can be traced back to the work of JohannDobereiner, a German chemist who formed the triads of elements with similar properties1863, John Newlands, an English chemist proposed the Law of Octaves. He based hisclassification of elements on the fact that similar properties could be noted for every eightelement when they are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses.1869 two scientists determined a way to put the elements in order. Lothar Meyer and DmitriMendeleev both came up with periodic tables that showed how elements should be groupedBoth scientists were teachers living and working in different places. Meyer lived and worked inGermany while Mendeleev in Russia. Both arranged the elements in order of increasing atomicmass while putting in groups those with similar properties. Their arrangement made sense sincesuch arrangement had the properties of elements repeat periodically.1914 Henry Moseley, an English physicist observed that X-ray frequencies emitted by elementscould be correlated better with their atomic numbers. This observation led to the developmentof the modern periodic law which states that the properties of elements are periodic functionsof their atomic numbers.A.

Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COMMUNITIES HAVE PROBLEMS, JUST LIKE PEOPLE</p><p></p><p>Problems are part of life. We all deal with individual problems, families have family issues, and communities have community problems. Communities must come together to solve their problems, just like families.</p><p>When communities try to solve problems, they start just like individuals do. They must reflect and analyze the issue to help come to a solution. But, before discussing solutions, problems must be identified.</p><p>So, after discussing a little bit about what problems look like, this section will explain what analyzing community problems is about, why it can be helpful, and then how to do it.</p><p>WHAT IS A COMMUNITY PROBLEM?</p><p></p><p>Problems can arise in any part of a community and come from any aspect of community life. There's a long list of nominees, and you probably know some of the main contenders. Can you name the leading problems in your community? Chances are you can at least start the list.</p><p>Below are examples of community problems:</p><p></p><p>Example Community Problems: Adolescent pregnancy, access to clean drinking water, child abuse and neglect, crime, domestic violence, drug use, pollution, mismanagement of resources, lack of funding for schools and services, ethnic conflict, health disparities, HIV/ AIDS, hunger, inadequate emergency services, inequality, jobs, lack of affordable housing, poverty,  transportation, violence, racism and police brutality.</p><p></p><p>WHAT OTHERS WOULD YOU ADD?</p><p></p><p>Rather than aim for a complete problem list, here are some criteria you may consider when identifying community problems:</p><p></p><p>The problem occurs too frequently (frequency)</p><p></p><p>The problem has lasted for a while (duration)</p><p></p><p>The problem affects many people (scope, or range)</p><p></p><p>The problem is disrupting to personal or community life, and possibly intense (severity)</p><p></p><p>The problem deprives people of legal or moral rights (equity)</p><p></p><p>The issue is perceived as a problem (perception)</p><p></p><p>This last criterion, perception, is an important one, and can also help indicate readiness for addressing the issue within the community.</p><p>What is seen as a problem can vary from place to place and group to group in the same community. Although there's no official definition of a community problem, the above examples and criteria above should help you begin to name and analyze community problems.</p><p>WHY SHOULD I ANALYZE A COMMUNITY PROBLEM?</p><p></p><p>Analyzing community problems is a way of thinking carefully about a problem or issue before acting on a solution. It first involves identifying reasons a problem exists and then, identifying possible solutions and a plan for improvement.</p><p>Example: The downtown area of a community is declining. Stores are closing, and moving out; no new stores are moving in. We want to revitalize that downtown. How should we do it?</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brainliest nalang po please</p><p></p><br />

                            20. Development of the Periodic Table1817, the development of the periodic table can be traced back to the work of JohannDobereiner, a German chemist who formed the triads of elements with similar properties1863, John Newlands, an English chemist proposed the Law of Octaves. He based hisclassification of elements on the fact that similar properties could be noted for every eightelement when they are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses.1869 two scientists determined a way to put the elements in order. Lothar Meyer and DmitriMendeleev both came up with periodic tables that showed how elements should be groupedBoth scientists were teachers living and working in different places. Meyer lived and worked inGermany while Mendeleev in Russia. Both arranged the elements in order of increasing atomicmass while putting in groups those with similar properties. Their arrangement made sense sincesuch arrangement had the properties of elements repeat periodically.1914 Henry Moseley, an English physicist observed that X-ray frequencies emitted by elementscould be correlated better with their atomic numbers. This observation led to the developmentof the modern periodic law which states that the properties of elements are periodic functionsof their atomic numbers.A.

Title: Real-Life Application of Quadratic Functions Objective: To appreciate the real-life application of quadratic Functions You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road.​</h2><br />
