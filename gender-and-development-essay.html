Then, write an essay (2-3 paragraphs) discussing the issues presented. You may include factual information to support your ideas. Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible.

                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

Then, write an essay (2-3 paragraphs) discussing the issues presented. You may include factual information to support your ideas. Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible.

There are many factors involved in the conflict.

                            8. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".
