                                            The First apple is the “Fruit of knowledge and evil” that Adam and Eve had according to the bible, that gave mankind the concept of right and wrong.
The Second apple is the apple that Sir Isaac Newton saw fell from its tree which lead to new discoveries in the field of science
The Third apple is the one Steve Jobs created, technology that became a major part of a man’s life.
1. Which of the three apples do you most likely believe that changed the world? Why?
2. Do you think if any of those three apples did not happen, the world is better or not? Why?
3. Based on the three apple story, when do you think life of humans begin to be complicated?</a>

He used to believe in evolution, a theory says that humans came from a species of monkeys. But because humans discovered DNA, his belief changed. According to Prof. Hsuuw, "The cells needed to be in the right order in the right place... No engineer could write that process, even in their dreams! The DNA structure is superbly written... When I think about how amazing it is, I am convinced that life is designed by God." Do you agree with professor Hsuuw? Explain your answer.​</a>

We are meant to be a farming-based country, yet the greatest team given/work done of GDP is the industry part/area, which employs the fewest people among Farming, Services, and others.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There would be no problems, delays, etc. if the government helped farmers by providing them with land, stuff that helps plants grow better, equipment, and money paid for working/profit. In my view, if their pay for labor was almost as much as a doctor's, life would be better for them and the kids would be encouraged to start/work at farming. They deserve it since they have given us food and medicine, food for farm animals and connected to chickens, hens, turkeys, and so on, shelter, and fiber for clothes and ropes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is technical advances.</p><p></p><p>When a mechanical planter or new technology is introduced, Filipino farmers are aware and a bit frightened. It is viewed as a danger to their low-wage occupations. During an (act of showing or proving) run, a farmer dropped a metal wrench/wire in the rice paddy, damaging the automated transplanter, according to my lecturer. I understand why they did it. It would put at risk the jobs of some farmers, and it isn't especially practical because it would only be used for up to two planting seasons per year. And the maintenance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Then there are the Farmers themselves.</p><p></p><p>They will not change their (crop production/helping anything grow) ways of doing things. Always preferring the usual manner. Rice (people who work to find information) would constantly advise them that they should only (add substances to the soil to help plants grow better) on this certain day, and that it is fine for the rice not to be flooded every time until harvest. It has been established by study that rice only need this substance that functions as food at a particular life stage, and that the (back and forth/doing one then the other) water and dry way of doing things produces higher yields than continuous flooding. They constantly claim they'll follow it, but in reality, they'll just keep doing what they've always done.</p><p></p><p>There are more than two, but not a lot of, and I hope that these major issues are resolved sooner rather than later.</p><p></p><p></p>Growing Global DemandClimate Change

While human health and life are our primary and immediate concerns to address, water and environmental systems from local to regional scales have seen discernible positive impacts due to the reduction of pollutant loading from industries, vehicle emission, and other sources. Anecdotal evidence indicates reduction in biochemical oxygen demand and coliform levels in rivers, improvement in air quality as a result of reduction in the loading of nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and other pollutants. The extent of recovery seen would not have been possible without extreme measures that have been forced on the society due to the pandemic, at the cost of several trillions of dollars across the globe. This enormous unintended experiment offers opportunities for unprecedented insights about the dynamics of our natural and built environment, and societal systems that can lead to feasible paths for preservation of recovered systems and new recovery pathways through sensible policies and practices.</p><p></p><p>The goal of the special collection is to develop insights into the link between human activities and impact on water and associated ecological, environmental, and built and sociological human systems, both during the recovery of the natural systems during the pandemic and possible subsequent degradation pathways as economic activities pickup up, including assessment of niche habitats that may provide long residence times for the virus and/or adverse impacts on ecosystems.. The rapid transient response presents an opportunity to capture the behavior of large, degraded, vulnerable but societally valuable systems both during the recovery and/or subsequent degradation, develop insights leading to hypothesis, theories, and predictive models, documented through compelling case studies and supporting data sets. Both direct and indirect impacts are possible. Direct impacts include water quality improvements owing to reduced industrial effluents while indirect impacts include changes in urban climate or land-atmosphere interactions owing to reduction in atmospheric pollution. Opportunities for assessing the cause and consequences of existing policies and practices, and development of alternate effective policies to preserve the recovered systems or guide systems for recovery, mitigate adverse impacts or enhance resilience are also possible.</p><p></p><p>This special section invites the following submission types: original research, preliminary insights, hypothesis and theory, new methods, perspective, conceptual analysis, data report and case studies, policy brief, brief research report, and opinion (for details of article types see https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/water#article-types)</p><p>Potential topics of interest are (we are open to other suggestions):</p><p>• Impact on water bodies</p><p>• Impact on water infrastructure</p><p>• Effluent management and water quality</p><p>• Impact on land-atmosphere interaction including vegetation activity and hydrometeorology</p><p>• Virus transport in the terrestrial and atmospheric environment</p><p></p><p>Keywords: COVID-19, Corona Virus, Water, Environment, Ecology, Human Systems</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Roar roar roar roar roar roar</p><br />
