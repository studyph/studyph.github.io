Flexion when sitting in front of a computer.12.A well-designed mouse should not cause undue pressure on the waist and forehead muscles. 13.Set the eye to screen ata distance that permits you to focus on the most easily screen. 14.Changing posture at frequent intervals maximizes fatigue when using a computer. 15.Place the keyboard in a position that allows the forearms to be close to the Horizontal and the wrists to be straight.​</a>

                                            One of the main ideas we focus while studying the concept of pure substanceand mixtures is physical properties. Color, hardness, malleability, solubility, electricalconductivity, density, melting point, and boiling point are all factors to consider. Weconstantly encounter and use materials and substances with different properties inour daily lives, such as paper items that we use in our online learning, kitchenutensils, and more. Deodorants, pesticides, shoe polish, plastics, nylons, andcrayons are some of the other by products with diverse qualities that come fromtrees.Trees are, without a doubt, essential in today's world. It is a blessing to beable to live in a country with so many trees. Aside from the numerous health benefitsthat trees provide, they absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and the carbon stored intheir wood helps to reduce the rate of global warming. In addition, because ourcountry is hit by an average of 20 typhoons each year, it aids in the prevention offloods, landslides, and soil erosion. Knowing the value of trees in terms of enhancingwildlife, building communities, developing the economy, and safeguarding our future,what can you do as a student to help reduce the destruction of our naturalresources, particularly the ongoing illegal logging in some parts of the world?Provide a solution to the fundamental issues that have resulted in thedegradation of Mother Earth and our ecology.I just want your opinions :)atleast 200-300 worlds pls​</a>

Color, hardness, malleability, solubility, electricalconductivity, density, melting point, and boiling point are all factors to consider. Weconstantly encounter and use materials and substances with different properties inour daily lives, such as paper items that we use in our online learning, kitchenutensils, and more. Deodorants, pesticides, shoe polish, plastics, nylons, andcrayons are some of the other by products with diverse qualities that come fromtrees.Trees are, without a doubt, essential in today's world. It is a blessing to beable to live in a country with so many trees. Aside from the numerous health benefitsthat trees provide, they absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and the carbon stored intheir wood helps to reduce the rate of global warming. In addition, because ourcountry is hit by an average of 20 typhoons each year, it aids in the prevention offloods, landslides, and soil erosion. Knowing the value of trees in terms of enhancingwildlife, building communities, developing the economy, and safeguarding our future,what can you do as a student to help reduce the destruction of our naturalresources, particularly the ongoing illegal logging in some parts of the world?Provide a solution to the fundamental issues that have resulted in thedegradation of Mother Earth and our ecology.I just want your opinions :)atleast 200-300 worlds pls​</h2><br />
