                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is commonly said that there are only two guarantees in life — death and taxes — but what can be more taxing than the prospect of one’s own death? Ceasing to exist is an overwhelmingly terrifying thought and it is one which has plagued individuals for centuries. This ancient stressor has been addressed over time by a number of different religious explanations and affirmations. Arguably, this capacity to provide answers for fundamental questions is what defines religion. For instance, under Hindu belief one’s soul lives on after biological death and is reborn in a new body. Under Christian belief one can expect to live in a heavenly paradise once one’s time runs out on earth. These are just two examples, but the extension of the self beyond its physical expiration date is a common thread in religious texts.</p><p></p><p>These promises of new life and mystifying promise lands are not simply handed out to everyone, however. They require an individual to faithfully practice and participate in accordance to the demands of specific commandments, doctrines, rituals, or tenants. Furthermore, despite one’s own faith in the words of an ancient text, or the messages of a religious figure, an individual will remain exposed to the trials, tribulations, and discomforts that exist in the world. During these instances a theodicy — a religious explanation for such sufferings — can help keep one’s faith by providing justification as to why bad things happen to good, faithful people. Theodicy is an attempt to explain or justify the existence of bad things or instances that occur in the world, such as death, disaster, sickness, and suffering. Theodicies are especially relied on to provide reason as to why a religion’s God (or God-like equivalent) allows terrible things to happen to good people.</p><p></p><p>Is there truly such a thing as heaven or hell? Can we expect to embody a new life after death? Are we really the creation of an omnipotent and transcendent Godly figure? These are all fascinating ontological questions — i.e., questions that are concerned with the nature of reality, our being and existence — and ones for which different religious traditions have different answers. For example, Buddhists and Taoists believe that there is a life force that can be reborn after death, but do not believe that there is a transcendent creator God, whereas Christian Baptists believe that one can be reborn once, or even many times, within a single lifetime. However, these questions are not the central focus of sociologists. Instead sociologists ask about the different social forms, experiences, and functions that religious organizations evoke and promote within society. What is religion as a social phenomenon? Why does it exist? In other words, the “truth” factor of religious beliefs is not the primary concern of sociologists. Instead, religion’s significance lies in its practical tendency to bring people together and, in notable cases, to violently divide them. For sociologists, it is key that religion guides people to act and behave in particular ways. How does it do so?</p><p></p><p>Regardless if one personally believes in the fundamental values, beliefs, and doctrines that certain religions present, one does not have to look very far to recognize the significance that religion has in a variety of different social aspects around the world. Religion can influence everything from how one spends their Sunday afternoon – -singing hymnals, listening to religious sermons, or refraining from participating in any type of work — to providing the justification for sacrificing one’s own life, as in the case in the Solar Temple mass suicide (Dawson &amp; Thiessen, 2014). Religious activities and ideals are found in political platforms, business models, and constitutional laws, and have historically produced rationales for countless wars. Some people adhere to the messages of a religious text to a tee, while others pick and choose aspects of a religion that best fit their personal needs. In other words, religion is present in a number of socially significant domains and can be expressed in a variety of different levels of commitment and fervour.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty - it is everybody's problem.  Everybody in a sense that boy or girl, young or old, even rich or poor, that is one of their problems.  The rich ones are affected for the fact that they are irritated by the poor ones, isn't it true?</p><p></p><p>Almost all of the Filipinos are considered poor.  And it is so hard to accept the fact that the innocent children are the one who are affected too much.  At their very young age, they are taught how to earn for a living, just for their own selves and for their family as well.  At their very young age, they are already prone to accidents or diseases which can kill them and their future.  No play, no childhood, no education  -   no progression</p><p></p>      As a student and one of the youths, poverty is a serious problem to deal with.  If you are poor, your future is not secured.  You have to pay first to have a security of your future, which is not present to the poor ones.  Your education seems to be endangered when you are poor.  There are instances that you have to be absent because your money is not enough.  And of course, your grade will be affected.  When a student is poor, his seems to be miserable.  He cannot pay the obliged school fees for his money is only enough for personal necessities, but sometimes, it is not even enough.  He cannot avail the required projects.  Even a single peso is very important. Every single peso is his future.  That is what a typical poor student is experiencing<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope its help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>39. B<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Newton's three <strong>laws of motion</strong> are Law of Dormancy, Law of Mass and Speed increase, and the Third<strong> Law of Motion</strong>. A body very still endures in its condition of rest, and a body in <strong>motion</strong> stays in steady motion along a straight line except if followed up on by an outside power. In the main law, an item won't change its<strong> motion</strong> except if a power follows up on it. In the subsequent law, the power on an article is equivalent to its mass occasions its speed increase. In the third law, when two items communicate, they apply powers to one another of equivalent size and inverse course.
</p><p>
</p><p>The focal point of Example 1 is Newton's first <strong>law of motion</strong> - here and there alluded to as the law of dormancy. Newton's first <strong>law of motion</strong> is often expressed as. An article very still stays very still and an item in motion stays in motion with a similar speed and a similar way except if followed up on by an unequal power. Newton's first <strong>law of motion</strong> expresses that a body very still will stay very still position just and a body which is in motion keeps on being in motion except if in any case they are followed up on by an outside power. At the point when an article is in <strong>motion</strong> the speed won't be equivalent to zero yet the speed increase will be equivalent to nothing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>what is newton's laws of motion:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5392520</p><p></p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
