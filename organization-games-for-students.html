</p><p>Step-by-step explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling Methods
</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling methods are the ways on selecting members from the population to be in the study. Researchers select samples rather than working with the overall population because most of the times, population involved in the study is large and it is impossible for them to gather the needed data for every object in the study. There are five ways to select a sample and they are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>Random Sampling
</p><p>In this method, everyone in the population has an equal chance to be chosen. It is like everyone's name is in a box and researchers draw out several names.
</p><p>
</p><p>Systematic Sampling
</p><p>In systematic, the list of elements in the study is "counted off". Meaning the members of the population are put in order and every nth member is selected to be in the sample.
</p><p>
</p><p>Convenience Sampling
</p><p>The readily available sample is used in the study. Researchers poll people as they walk by on the street.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sfratified Sampling
</p><p>For stratified, the population is split into groups, then from each group samples are selected.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cluster Sampling
</p><p>In this method, population is also split into groups. The difference from stratified is that samples in cluster consist of every member of the selected groups.

Researchers select samples rather than working with the overall population because most of the times, population involved in the study is large and it is impossible for them to gather the needed data for every object in the study. There are five ways to select a sample and they are as follows:</p><p></p><strong>Random Sampling</strong><p></p><p>In this method, everyone in the population has an equal chance to be chosen. It is like everyone's name is in a box and researchers draw out several names. </p><p></p><strong>Systematic Sampling</strong><p></p><p>In systematic, the list of elements in the study is "counted off". Meaning the members of the population are put in order and every nth member is selected to be in the sample.</p><p></p><strong>Convenience Sampling</strong><p></p><p>The readily available sample is used in the study. Researchers poll people as they walk by on the street.</p><p></p><strong>Sfratified Sampling</strong><p></p><p>For stratified, the population is split into groups, then from each group samples are selected.</p><p></p><strong>Cluster Sampling</strong><p></p><p>In this method, population is also split into groups. The difference from stratified is that samples in cluster consist of every member of the selected groups. </p><p></p><p>For the definition of statistics:</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/108281</p><p></p><p>For the application of statistics in education:</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2093246</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>1. Stratified Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: </p><p>The whole population is divided into subgroups (math classes). This could also be called stratum and the sample size is chosen from each of the subset of the population. </p><p></p>2. Random Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: </p><p>From the 100,000 questionnaires, only 10,000 are chose by chance. So this is considered to be random sampling.</p><p></p>3. Cluster Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The whole population is divided into different clusters (classes) then all the elements per cluster are studied. That is, the classes are randomly selected but the elements in each cluster is included in the sample size.</p><p></p>4. Random Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: All the names of the contestants have equal chances of being chosen. This is a sampling by chance. </p><p></p>5. Convinience Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The polls itself is most often a sign that the sampling is Convinience. There are 1000 slots each for men and women for polls which also hints accidental sampling or similar to convinience sampling.</p>6. Cluster Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Like number 3, the clusters are randomly selected but all the elements in each cluster is included in the sample size and there is no need to choose from each group. </p><p></p>7. Systematic Sampling<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Smart conducts a thorough test of quality in every 100th cellphone.
