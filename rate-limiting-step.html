                                            When a tissue or blood vessel is torn or cut, the cells near the damaged part send out
signals to activate platelets. As platelets begin to form a plug, more chemical signals are
released to attract more platelets until the bleeding stops.

2. When you do physical activities, the amount of energy produced on your cells increases.
This turn causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. The
continuous increase of carbon dioxide in the blood creates a weak acid that lowers your
blood pH. This drop-in pH level signals your brain to increase your heart rate and
respiration for you to get more oxygen.

3. Hydrochloric acid is one of the important substances secreted in your stomach to digest
proteins and other minerals in the food you eat. The presence of undigested food in your
stomach triggers the secretion of more hydrochloric acid so that digestion will proceed.

4. Homeostasis can be likened to driving a car. If the speed limit on a certain highway is 60
kilometers per hour (km/h) and you are driving at a rate of 20 km/h, the cars behind you
will become inconvenienced and will start blowing their horns. Thus, you step on the gas to
speed up.

Type of mechanism: ____________________________________________________________________
5. As the mother labors during childbirth, oxytocin is released inside her body. Oxytocin, a
hormone, causes muscle contractions to speed up and intensify. An increase in muscle
contractions allows more oxytocin to be released until the baby is born. The birth of the
baby ends with the continuous releases of oxytocin.

All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</a>

2. When you do physical activities, the amount of energy produced on your cells increases.
This turn causes an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. The
continuous increase of carbon dioxide in the blood creates a weak acid that lowers your
blood pH. This drop-in pH level signals your brain to increase your heart rate and
respiration for you to get more oxygen.

5. As the mother labors during childbirth, oxytocin is released inside her body. Oxytocin, a
hormone, causes muscle contractions to speed up and intensify. An increase in muscle
contractions allows more oxytocin to be released until the baby is born. The birth of the

Create kayo ng outline (either topic outline or sentence outline) based sa essay na ito. :)BirdsBy Pragati GhoshBirds are special kind of animal species with certain specific characteristics that are common to all of them. All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</h2><br />

                            14. 1. How many different phenotypes can be expressed in a character controlled solely by a one gene, two allele system, in which the alleles are codominant? a. Onec. Threeb. Twod. Four_____2. Which of the following pairs of nucleotide substitutions describe both a transition and a transversion. a. Adenine to guanine and cytosine to thiamine b. Adenine to cytosine and guanine to adenine c. Cytosine to guanine and guanine to adenine d. Guanine to thiamine and thiamine to adenine _____3. An RNA molecule had the sequence 5’ GCAAUGCAA 3’. What is the sequence of the DNA strand that was transcribed? a. 5’-GCAATGCAA-3’c. 5’-GCTTAGCTT-3’ b. 5’-AACGTAAGC-3’ d. 5’-TTGCATTGC-3’_____4. What explanation arising from our analysis of allele frequencies and selection was provided for the observation that almost all genetic disorders are recessive? a. Advantageous alleles are dominant and selected so the deleterious ones must therefore be recessive. b. Because biochemical pathways have rate-limiting steps, deleterious mutations are always selected to become a recessive. c. Mutations from dominant alleles to recessive ones are more likely to be selected than the converse. d. Selection to remove recessive alleles from populations is much less effective than it is fro removing dominant ones. _____5. Full pod shape (F) is dominant to constricted pod shape (f), and yellow pod color (Y) is dominant to green pod color (y) in pea plants. A pure-breeding green plant with full pods is crossed with a purebreeding yellow plant with constricted pods. The offspring are then testcrossed. What if the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring? a. 1:2:1 c. 1:1:1:1 b. 3:1 d. 9:3:3:1_____6. Suppose a white-furred rabbit breeds with a black-furred rabbit and all of their offspring have a phenotype of gray fur. What does the gene for fur color in rabbits appear to be an example of? a. Codominance c. Incomplete dominance b. Complete dominanced. Mosaicism _____7. Which type of mutation results in the sickle-cell disease phenotype? a. Codon deletionc. Frameshift mutation b. Conservative mutation d. Non-conservative missense mutation _____8. A silent mutation is highly unlikely to affect protein because: a. The silent mutation does not cause a frameshift b. The silent mutation substitutes the same type of amino acid c. The dominant allele can compensate for the silent mutation d. Multiple codons can code for the same amino acid9. Which of the following represents a transition? a. G → Ac. A → T b. T → A d. G → C _____10. Which of the following violate the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?? a. Little or no migrationc.
