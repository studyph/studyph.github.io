                                            Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10. As one of the frontliners during this pandemic, doctors and nurses risk themselves just to provide healthcare services.​</a>

                            5. Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10. As one of the frontliners during this pandemic, doctors and nurses risk themselves just to provide healthcare services.​</h2><br />
