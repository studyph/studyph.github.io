                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As wavelength increases, frequency decreases(indirect relationship).
</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The wavelength and frequency of light are closely related. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. Because all light waves move through a vacuum at the same speed, the number of wave crests passing by a given point in one second depends on the wavelength.</p><br />

                            26. Light is the power to dispel darkness. You have this power to move back the darkness in yourself and in others–with the birth of light created when one mind illuminates another, when one heart kindles another, when one man strengthens another. And its flame also enlarges within you as you pass on! Throughout the history, ... Children of Darkness have tried to smother this passage of light from man to man Throughout the history, Dictators, large and small, have tried- ... to darken, ...to diminish, ...and to separate men by force! But... always in the end, ... they fail! For always somewhere in the world the Light remains! ... ready to burn its brightest where it is dark. ... a Light that began when God created the world!
