This is the brainstorming part of the writing process. </strong></p><p><strong>Organize Your Main Ideas</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The introduction will be a jumping off point for what you will be presenting in your paper; your conclusion will be the culmination of the information you have presented, including insights gained from the vast array of knowledge you have acquired. The body sections of the outline should be a breakdown of the various areas, aspects and subjects you plan to discuss in your term paper.</p><p></p><p>The preliminary outline will function merely as a general guideline to your reading. As your reading progresses and you gain more information, you can revise and extend your outline accordingly. If you find that your source material does not contain enough information to develop a major topic sufficiently, you may have to delete that topic entirely and substitute one that is better covered. Your reading may also suggest an entirely new topic that you may want to develop. Make notes or revisions on your outline as you pursue your reading, so you have all the information in one place when you are ready to prepare your final outline.</p><p></p><p>Keep your thesis statement before you at all times so that you can judge the relevance of your material when preparing your preliminary outline and also when taking notes on your reading. If, as a result of your reading, you find that major topics need revising, you may need to revise your thesis statement accordingly.</p><p>Have a goodnight/Day</p><p>-Please mark thanks- :)</p><br />

That is, you only want to mention the content of the body paragraphs; you do not want to go in to a lot of detail and repeat what will be in the rest of the essay.</p><p></p><p>The first body section or paragraph should focus on one of your main points and provide evidence to support that point. There should be two to three supporting points: reasons, facts, statistics, quotations, examples, or a mix of these. Both the second and third body sections should follow the same pattern. Providing three body sections with one point each that supports the thesis should provide the reader with enough detail to be convinced of your argument or fully understand the concept you are explaining. However, remember that some sections will require more explanation, and you may need to separate this information into multiple paragraphs.</p><p></p><p>You can order your sections in the most logical way to explain your ideas.

You want to make sure you are giving thorough, comprehensive, and clear explanations on the topic. Never assume the reader knows everything about your topic (even if it is covered in the reader’s field of study). For example, even though some of your instructors may teach criminology, they may have specialized in different areas from the one about which you are writing; they most likely have a strong understanding of the concepts but may not recall all the small details on the topic. If your instructor specialized in crime mapping and data analysis for example, he or she may not have a strong recollection of specific criminological theories related to other areas of study. Providing enough background information without being too detailed is a fine balance, but you always want to ensure you have no gaps in the information, so your reader will not have to guess your intention.
