                                            ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.

                            5. ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.
