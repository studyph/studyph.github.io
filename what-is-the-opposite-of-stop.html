Yet, because of the opposition the work stopped. Read Ezra 4:24. God raised up twoprophets in Ezra 5:1-2 to encourage the work to continue. Have you stopped doing something forGod because you've faced some opposition?

                                            What is ItFriction is a force that opposes an object’s motion resulting in the slowing down or even stopping the moving object. In the activity, when the ball was pushed, it rolled on the floor and stopped after a few seconds. It is the friction between the ball and the floor that caused the stopping of the ball. But how does friction occur? While the ball is rolling on the floor, the surface of the rolling ball rubs against the surface of the floor. Friction always acts opposite the direction of an object’s motion. The floor exerts a frictional force opposite the ball’s motion as shown in the figure below. Figure 2. Frictional force acting on a rolling ball. Illustrated by Orencio D. Estrera Friction does not only occur on the surfaces of solid objects rubbing against one another, but it also occurs when air particles rub against objects falling down, thrown upward and flying airplanes and kites. The force that opposes the movement of objects in air is called air friction or air resistance. You will learn more about it in the next lesson.Please naman po yung maayos na sagot kailangan ko puro blangko naman po yung mga answer niyo​</a>

                                            A plane needs to reach a velocity of 300 km/h relative to the air in order to take off. If there is a wind blowing at 80 km/h in the direction opposite to take off, what velocity must the plane reach relative to ground in order to take off. A ball is rolled at a velocity of 12 m/sec. After 36 seconds, it comes to a stop. What is the acceleration of the ball?</a>

                            9. What is ItFriction is a force that opposes an object’s motion resulting in the slowing down or even stopping the moving object. In the activity, when the ball was pushed, it rolled on the floor and stopped after a few seconds. It is the friction between the ball and the floor that caused the stopping of the ball. But how does friction occur? While the ball is rolling on the floor, the surface of the rolling ball rubs against the surface of the floor. Friction always acts opposite the direction of an object’s motion. The floor exerts a frictional force opposite the ball’s motion as shown in the figure below. Figure 2. Frictional force acting on a rolling ball. Illustrated by Orencio D. Estrera Friction does not only occur on the surfaces of solid objects rubbing against one another, but it also occurs when air particles rub against objects falling down, thrown upward and flying airplanes and kites. The force that opposes the movement of objects in air is called air friction or air resistance.
