These atoms have the same atomic number but For example, hydrogen has three isotopes. Hydrogen-1 has one proton and(2) neutrons; hydrogen-2 has one proton and one neutron, and hydrogen-3 has one proton and (3) neutrons. Most of the elements naturally occur as a mixture of isotopes. Examples include oxygen and chlorine. Oxygen consists of (4) isotopes and chlorine consist of two isotopes. Some elements, however, do not have naturally occurring isotopes. Elements that do not have isotopes include (5) In chemical reactions, only the electrons are involved. Since isotopes have the same number of these subatomic particles, they have (8). chemical properties. For example, the two isotopes of chlorine-chlorine-35 and chlorine-37-both react with sodium to form (9) On the other hand, isotopes have (10). physical properties because they have a different number of (11) The number of neutrons in an atom affects its (12), and in turn, affects the physical properties of the atom. For example, the boiling point and density of hydrogen-2 are slightly (13) than hydrogen-1. Isotopes which emit radiation of high energy are called (14) produced by bombarding an atom with fast neutrons. These fast neutrons are produced in a (5) These are artificially This process transforms a stable atom into unstable isotopes of the same element. The high-energy radiation emitted by radioisotopes can damage living cells and therefore can be dangerous. However, radioisotopes serve a variety of important applications when handled properly.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Yes, Baroque art and Renaissance art are two forms of art between which a key difference can be discerned. Baroque art refers to a form of art that was originated in Rome. Baroque art became popular for its complex and contradictory nature as well as its ability to evoke emotion. Renaissance art was a combined influence of nature, classical learning, and individuality of man. The key difference between these two forms is that while Baroque art is characterized by ornate details, Renaissance art is characterized by the fusion of Christianity and science in order to create realism through art.<p></p>2. Definitions of Baroque Art and Renaissance Art:Baroque Art: Baroque art was a form of art that emerged in Europe in the late 16th century.Renaissance Art: Renaissance art was a form of art that emerged in Europe in the 14th century.Characteristics of Baroque Art and Renaissance Art:Time Period:Baroque Art: The Baroque art was produced between the later part of the 16th century and the mid-18th century.Renaissance Art: The Renaissance spread between the 14th century and the 17th century.Features:Baroque Art: Baroque art is characterized by ornate details.Renaissance Art: Renaissance art is characterized by the fusion of Christianity and science in order to create realism through art. -The Baroque art was produced between the later part of the 16th century and the mid-18th century. It is interesting to note that the word Baroque is derived from the Portuguese word ‘barocco.’ It means ‘flawed pearl’.<p></p>- The word Renaissance is an Italian word meaning ‘rebirth.’ This style focused more on learning. Leonardo da Vinci was one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance period. The Renaissance spread through the continent of Europe between the 14th century and the 17th century.<p></p>3. • It is important to know that Renaissance style of art laid more importance and significance to the concept called perception. Perception is a concept of drawing that made the three-dimensional look of the art piece possible. The buildings could nicely fit into paintings. The artists created paintings in which two buildings can be spotted adjacent to each other with the same vanishing point.<p></p>Another important feature of the Renaissance art is the incorporation of a technique called as Sfumato. This is a wonderful technique by which you can create a nice contrast between light and dark portions of a painting. You can find the Sfumato technique nicely handled by da Vinci in his painting, ‘Mona Lisa’. Foreshortening is another art technique employed by the Renaissance artists. According to this technique, an object would appear smaller than it actually is. It is actually due to an illusion. Another technique employed by the Renaissance artists is chiaroscuro. There is not a big difference between sfumato and chiaroscuro techniques of Renaissance style of art.<p></p>• Baroque art has developed at least after the Renaissance period. It can be said that it started after the 16th century. This has taken place in a bid to draw more crowds to the Catholic Church. Baroque painting featured exaggerated lighting, intense emotions and even a kind of artistic sensationalism, but Baroque art did not depict the style of people that lived in that period.<p></p>It is interesting to note that Baroque architecture encouraged the construction of domes, colonnades, color effects and the like. The Augustusburg Palace near Cologne is a wonderful example of Baroque architecture. Trevi Fountain in Rome is another Baroque creation.<p></p>Baroque art is known to have four important characteristics. They are light, realism and naturalism, lines and time. Baroque art boasts only one source of light, namely, tenebrism. An example of this concept is the ‘Judith and the Maidservant with Head of Holofernes’ by Artemisia Gentileschi.<p></p>Rubens supported the characteristic of realism in his art. Baroque art heavily relied on realism, unlike the Greek art. Lines helped the artists to convey motion. In other words, it can be said that lines contributed to the feeling of motion. Time was used as a characteristic that can convey the strength of nature. Baroque art relied on these four characteristics.<br />

These atoms have the same atomic number but For example, hydrogen has three isotopes. Hydrogen-1 has one proton and(2) neutrons; hydrogen-2 has one proton and one neutron, and hydrogen-3 has one proton and (3) neutrons. Most of the elements naturally occur as a mixture of isotopes. Examples include oxygen and chlorine. Oxygen consists of (4) isotopes and chlorine consist of two isotopes. Some elements, however, do not have naturally occurring isotopes. Elements that do not have isotopes include (5) In chemical reactions, only the electrons are involved. Since isotopes have the same number of these subatomic particles, they have (8). chemical properties. For example, the two isotopes of chlorine-chlorine-35 and chlorine-37-both react with sodium to form (9) On the other hand, isotopes have (10). physical properties because they have a different number of (11) The number of neutrons in an atom affects its (12), and in turn, affects the physical properties of the atom. For example, the boiling point and density of hydrogen-2 are slightly (13) than hydrogen-1.

These fast neutrons are produced in a (5) These are artificially This process transforms a stable atom into unstable isotopes of the same element. The high-energy radiation emitted by radioisotopes can damage living cells and therefore can be dangerous. However, radioisotopes serve a variety of important applications when handled properly.
