                                            Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</a>

The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</a>

                            9. Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</h2><br />

                            22. B. In each paragraph below, underline the key sentence and encircle at least one supporting sentence.1. The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</h2><br />
