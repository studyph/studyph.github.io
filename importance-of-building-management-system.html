In this system, the number of trees planted in the same area is almost double. But the distance between the trees is much reduced. For this reason, trees with shorter life space are chosen for the center. 5. Trees are planted at the corners of an equilateral triangle. Six trees are positioned at the corners of this hexagon with a seventh in the center all arranged in the three rows. 6.

                                            By 1940, Nazi Germany had formed an alliance with a group of controlled countries. Germany pushed surplus-producing trading partners to spend their surplus on German imports. As a result, Britain was able to preserve Sterling country surpluses in its financial system, while Germany was able to force trading partners to buy its goods. The United States was concerned that a sharp reduction in war spending would return the country to the 1930s levels of unemployment. Thus, the U.S. wanted the sterling nations and all European countries to import from them. As a result, the United States backed free trade and the ability to change currencies into gold or dollars on a global scale.At the Bretton Woods conference, many of the same specialists who watched the 1930s became the architects of a new, united postwar system, whose guiding ideas became "no more beggar thy neighbor" and "manage flows of speculative financial capital." It was sought to avoid a repeat of this competitive devaluation process, which would not force debtor countries to reduce their industrial bases, by keeping interest rates high enough to attract international bank deposits. John Maynard Keynes, the foremost British economist whose core ideas essentially changed our understanding of macroeconomics and economic policy trends, became wary of returning to the Great Depression. He was behind Britain's proposal to force surplus nations by a "use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism to either import from debtor nations, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to debtor nations (Bretton Woods System, 2016).EXPLANATION:​</a>

Color the star yellow ( ) if the statement is an advantage. If not, color the minus sign red ( ).1. Geothermal energy is extracted from the earth without burning fossil fuels and practically less to no emissions of greenhouse gases.2. Man cannot just build a geothermal power plant in some vacant land plot in all regions of Earth.3. During the installation of power plant there are gases released into the atmosphere during digging.4. Geothermal energy is a naturally occurring resource there is no fuel required.5. High investment costs for the geothermal systems and there is no guarantee that the amount of energy to be harnessed could justify the capital and expenditure and operation costs.6. Geothermal reservoirs are naturally replenished. Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy that will last for a long time.7. Cost-effective, since it can be extracted locally, the government need not import fuel for geothermal power plants. The economic benefits remain in the region. 8. Geothermal energy also runs the risk of triggering earthquakes, due to alterations in the Earth’s structure as a result of digging. 9. It will not be used up for a long period time. It provides a reliable source of energy as compared to other renewable resources.10. To maintain the sustainability of geothermal energy fluid needs to be pumped back into the underground reservoirs faster than it is depleted. It needs to be properly managed to maintain its sustainability.

That makes asthma the number one cause of schoc sasenteeism due to chronic liness. the lack of good quality of indoor air may adversely impact trese children and the adults who teach them. "we know that fresh zir, proper circulation and managing humidity are important in our homes," said dr. mary lasley, pediatric allergist. "Why shouldn't this be true in a school?" part of the air quality problem can be traced to energy conservation. Since the energy crisis in the 1970s, buildings have been tightened up to conserve energy, leading to fresh air circulation problems. And school systems tend to close down heat and air systems at night to further conserve energy. This can easily expand problems of poor air circulation and create excess relative humidity in the school, contributing to mold and dust mite growth,​</a>

                            5. By 1940, Nazi Germany had formed an alliance with a group of controlled countries. Germany pushed surplus-producing trading partners to spend their surplus on German imports. As a result, Britain was able to preserve Sterling country surpluses in its financial system, while Germany was able to force trading partners to buy its goods. The United States was concerned that a sharp reduction in war spending would return the country to the 1930s levels of unemployment. Thus, the U.S. wanted the sterling nations and all European countries to import from them. As a result, the United States backed free trade and the ability to change currencies into gold or dollars on a global scale.At the Bretton Woods conference, many of the same specialists who watched the 1930s became the architects of a new, united postwar system, whose guiding ideas became "no more beggar thy neighbor" and "manage flows of speculative financial capital." It was sought to avoid a repeat of this competitive devaluation process, which would not force debtor countries to reduce their industrial bases, by keeping interest rates high enough to attract international bank deposits. John Maynard Keynes, the foremost British economist whose core ideas essentially changed our understanding of macroeconomics and economic policy trends, became wary of returning to the Great Depression. He was behind Britain's proposal to force surplus nations by a "use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism to either import from debtor nations, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to debtor nations (Bretton Woods System, 2016).EXPLANATION:​</h2><br />

Color the star yellow ( ) if the statement is an advantage. If not, color the minus sign red ( ).1. Geothermal energy is extracted from the earth without burning fossil fuels and practically less to no emissions of greenhouse gases.2. Man cannot just build a geothermal power plant in some vacant land plot in all regions of Earth.3. During the installation of power plant there are gases released into the atmosphere during digging.4. Geothermal energy is a naturally occurring resource there is no fuel required.5. High investment costs for the geothermal systems and there is no guarantee that the amount of energy to be harnessed could justify the capital and expenditure and operation costs.6. Geothermal reservoirs are naturally replenished. Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy that will last for a long time.7. Cost-effective, since it can be extracted locally, the government need not import fuel for geothermal power plants. The economic benefits remain in the region. 8. Geothermal energy also runs the risk of triggering earthquakes, due to alterations in the Earth’s structure as a result of digging. 9. It will not be used up for a long period time. It provides a reliable source of energy as compared to other renewable resources.10. To maintain the sustainability of geothermal energy fluid needs to be pumped back into the underground reservoirs faster than it is depleted. It needs to be properly managed to maintain its sustainability.

Since the energy crisis in the 1970s, buildings have been tightened up to conserve energy, leading to fresh air circulation problems.
