It can be found either in the beginning or in the middle of a</p><p>sentence.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Progressive tenses are used to discuss ongoing or continuing actions. They can also be used to talk about an action that is, was, or will be occurring at the same time as another action. The progressive tenses use a form of the verb to be plus the present participle of the verb.</p><p></p><p>2.Bridging words create narrative flow. They connect two separate ideas with some sort of relationship. They can be used to connect separate clauses or sentences, or even paragraphs, with more flexibility than a simple conjunction.</p><p></p><p>3.We use where as a conjunction meaning 'in the place that' or 'in situations that'. The clause with where is a subordinate clause and needs a main clause to complete its meaning. If the where clause comes before the main clause, we use a comma: Where you find a lot of water, you will also find these beautiful insects.</p><p></p><p>paki brainleist nlng po at rate,heart and follow:)</p><p>#sanamakatulong</p><br />
