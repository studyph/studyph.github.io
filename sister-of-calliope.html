                                            GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5. Why do they sometimes go to Mount Olympus?​</a>

                                            The story of Orpheus andEurydice(by Apollonius of Rhodes,Virgil and Ovid)Orpheus was the son of oneof the Muse Calliope andthe god Apollo. His mothergave him the gift of musicand Thrace where he grewupfosteredit.TheThracians were the most musical of the peoples of Greece. But Orpheus had norival there or anywhere except the gods alone. There was no limit to his powerwhen he played and sang. No one and nothing could resist him. Everythinganimate and inanimate followed him. He moved the rocks on the hillside andturned the courses of the rivers..When he first met and how he wooed the maiden he loved, Eurydice, we are nottold, but it is clear that no maiden he wanted could have resisted the power ofhis song. They were married, but their joy was brief. Directly after the wedding,as the bride walked in a meadow with her bridesmaids, a viper stung her andshe died. Orpheus' grief was overwhelming. He could not endure it. Hedetermined to go down to the world of death and try to bring Eurydice back. Hesaid to himself, “ With my song , I will charm Demeter's daughter, I will charmthe Lord of the Dead, moving their hearts with my melody. I will bear her awayfrom Hades.”He dared more than any other man ever dared for his love. He took thefearsome journey to the underworld. There he struck his lyre, and at the soundall that vast multitude were charmed to stillness. Listening to the melody of hislyre, tears flowed down at the cheeks of Hades. And so with Proserpine, whowas deeply moved.They summoned Eurydice and gave her to him, but upon one condition: that hewould not look back at her as she followed him, until they had reached theupper world. So the two passed through the great doors of Hades to the pathwhich would take them out of the darkness, climbing up and up. He knew thatshe must be just behind him, but he longed unutterably to give one glance tomake sure. But now they were almost there, the blackness was turning gray;now he had stepped out joyfully into the daylight. Then he turned to her. It wastoo soon; she was still in the cavern. He saw her in the dim light, and he heldout his arms to clasp her; but on the instant she was gone. She had slippedback into the darkness. All he heard was one faint word, "Farewell."Desperately he tried to rush after her and follow her down, but he was notallowed. The gods would not consent to his entering the world of the dead asecond time, while he was still alive. He was forced to return to the earth alone,in utter desolation. Then he forsook the company of men. He wandered throughthe wild solitudes of Thrace, comfortless except for his lyre, playing, alwaysplaying, and the rocks and the rivers and the trees heard him gladly, his onlycompanions.TASK 4: Organize your thoughtsFollowing the instructions below, fill in the graphic organizer with details from thestory, Orpheus and Eurydice.1.

                            2. GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5. Why do they sometimes go to Mount Olympus?​</h2><br />

                            15. The story of Orpheus andEurydice(by Apollonius of Rhodes,Virgil and Ovid)Orpheus was the son of oneof the Muse Calliope andthe god Apollo. His mothergave him the gift of musicand Thrace where he grewupfosteredit.TheThracians were the most musical of the peoples of Greece. But Orpheus had norival there or anywhere except the gods alone. There was no limit to his powerwhen he played and sang. No one and nothing could resist him. Everythinganimate and inanimate followed him. He moved the rocks on the hillside andturned the courses of the rivers..When he first met and how he wooed the maiden he loved, Eurydice, we are nottold, but it is clear that no maiden he wanted could have resisted the power ofhis song. They were married, but their joy was brief. Directly after the wedding,as the bride walked in a meadow with her bridesmaids, a viper stung her andshe died. Orpheus' grief was overwhelming. He could not endure it. Hedetermined to go down to the world of death and try to bring Eurydice back. Hesaid to himself, “ With my song , I will charm Demeter's daughter, I will charmthe Lord of the Dead, moving their hearts with my melody. I will bear her awayfrom Hades.”He dared more than any other man ever dared for his love. He took thefearsome journey to the underworld. There he struck his lyre, and at the soundall that vast multitude were charmed to stillness. Listening to the melody of hislyre, tears flowed down at the cheeks of Hades. And so with Proserpine, whowas deeply moved.They summoned Eurydice and gave her to him, but upon one condition: that hewould not look back at her as she followed him, until they had reached theupper world. So the two passed through the great doors of Hades to the pathwhich would take them out of the darkness, climbing up and up. He knew thatshe must be just behind him, but he longed unutterably to give one glance tomake sure. But now they were almost there, the blackness was turning gray;now he had stepped out joyfully into the daylight. Then he turned to her. It wastoo soon; she was still in the cavern. He saw her in the dim light, and he heldout his arms to clasp her; but on the instant she was gone. She had slippedback into the darkness. All he heard was one faint word, "Farewell."Desperately he tried to rush after her and follow her down, but he was notallowed. The gods would not consent to his entering the world of the dead asecond time, while he was still alive. He was forced to return to the earth alone,in utter desolation. Then he forsook the company of men. He wandered throughthe wild solitudes of Thrace, comfortless except for his lyre, playing, alwaysplaying, and the rocks and the rivers and the trees heard him gladly, his onlycompanions.TASK 4: Organize your thoughtsFollowing the instructions below, fill in the graphic organizer with details from thestory, Orpheus and Eurydice.1.
