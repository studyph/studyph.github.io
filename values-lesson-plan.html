                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment: 15 minutes      Challenges are meant to motivate you and see what you are capable of doing. What's more, when you try to look back on those tough times, you can be truly proud of how you have overcome them using the most powerful weapon that you have your gained knowledge and skills. Your experiences at home, school and community, both positive and negative, give you important lessons that can help and guide you in dealing with future challenges.       The following are ways on how you can use and apply your academic and life lessons to deal future challenges:       3 Rs of Overcoming Life's Challenges through Gained Knowledge 1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</a>

                                            1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through yourthoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences athome, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solvingand decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advicethat your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration notonly on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges,you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions andreflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help yousucceed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearnand re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experienceto another3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details ofwhat you have learned.

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>3 Rs of Overcoming Life's Challenges through Gained Knowledge
</strong></p><p>Note: This is not something to be answered. You only have to read and comprehend this. Thus, I will underline the word that best define the R's.</p><p>
</p><p>1.<strong> Reflect.</strong> Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Respond</strong>. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. <strong>Review</strong>. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST!</strong></p><p></p><br />

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</h2><br />
