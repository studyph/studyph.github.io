                                            Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar" begins at "Sunset," which is a time of day often used in poetry to symbolize dying or death. Indeed, the sun setting over the horizon, and thus the light of day fading into the dark of night, seems a fitting symbol for the end of a human life.The "bar" mentioned in the poem's title and in the third line of the first stanza refers to a sandbar, and it symbolizes the transition between life and death. The speaker says that he hopes there will be "no moaning of the bar / When (he) put(s) out to sea." The implication here is that he hopes his own transition from life to death will be smooth and without the pain or discomfort implied by the "moaning."In the second stanza, the speaker hopes that his journey towards death, represented in the poem as a journey out to sea, takes place at high tide, when the tide "moving seems asleep" because it is "Too full for sound and foam." In other words, at high tide the water will be smoother and calmer, as the poet hopes his death will be also. The tide here is a fitting symbol for the transition from life to death, because the tide is controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon, thus implying that the speaker's death is inevitable and also that the speaker feels pulled towards his death.In the third stanza, the speaker references the "dark" which will follow sunset. The dark here is a symbol of death and implies that the speaker expects death to be perhaps something like a void.In the final stanza, there are references to water to symbolize the inevitable flow of time. The speaker refers to "Time and Place" as a "bourne," meaning a small stream. He then says that this stream will flow into a "flood" which "may bear (him) far." The flood that the stream flows into here symbolizes the all-consuming nature of death. For every man, the poem implies, the stream of time will eventually flow into and become an all-consuming flood, which in turn will pull each man down to his death.​</a>

                                            "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!​</a>

                                            The Parable of the Rainbow Colors²Juan M. FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility. But as time went on, the colors declaration became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to put down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color.It reaches the point when the colors were actually quarrelling.Said the color Red, 'I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life's sustaining blood is colored red. i represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are colored red.The color Yellow retorted, "What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remain.What outlandish claims!" interposed the color Orange. 'Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange."Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves you are referring to my color declared the color Green. "I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color."The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, "What can be more expansive than the sky and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.The color indigo came out with the statement. "You talk about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence, and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.Guide Questions:1. What characteristics of the colors can be compared to the youth of today?2. To what color do you compare yourself? Why?3. Why is cooperation emphasized in the selection?4. Based on its characteristics how can a rainbow represent hope?5. What message does the selection want to convey?​</a>

No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility But as time went on, the colors' declaration became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to put down the other colors. Their daim became very explicit as to who was the best color. It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling, Said the color Red, "I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life's sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are colored red." The color Yellow retorted, "What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remain." "What outlandish claims!" interposed the color Orange Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. "Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color," declared the color Green. "I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery provide. I am the most important color." The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, 'What can be more expansive than the sky and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces." The color Indigo came out with the statement, "You talk about wide areas.

                                            what is the meaning behind the flag of the philippines?
The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle which symbolizing liberty, equality and fraternity. A horizontal blue stripe symbolize peace, truth, and justice and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism and valor. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each rays represents a Philippine province. At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed anf golden-yellow star, each of it represents one of the country's three main island groups which is; Luzon, Visayas (though originally referring to Panay) and Mindanao. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.</a>

Imagine you are a detective taking a closer look at those buildings you saw earlier on as a superhero. This time, rather than taking in the big picture, you're looking for something specific and rejecting anything that does not match what's on your list.2. When listening, it is also possible to get the ‘whole picture’ but with one crucial difference: information comes in a sequence. And in that sequence of information, there are content words (the nouns, adjectives and verbs) that can help you form that picture.3. Imagine you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds, and thunder. What do you imagine he is about to tell you?4. Imagine you are a tourist in a country whose language you do not speak. In a restaurant, you hand over a credit card to pay for the bill, but the server seems to say something apologetic in response. Even though you don't understand his words, you can probably conclude that the restaurant doesn't take credit cards, and you need to pay with cash instead.​</a>

                                            "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The idiom "Don't fly too close to the sun" means to not take risks or because you're becoming too over confident and reckless.

                            13. Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar" begins at "Sunset," which is a time of day often used in poetry to symbolize dying or death. Indeed, the sun setting over the horizon, and thus the light of day fading into the dark of night, seems a fitting symbol for the end of a human life.The "bar" mentioned in the poem's title and in the third line of the first stanza refers to a sandbar, and it symbolizes the transition between life and death. The speaker says that he hopes there will be "no moaning of the bar / When (he) put(s) out to sea." The implication here is that he hopes his own transition from life to death will be smooth and without the pain or discomfort implied by the "moaning."In the second stanza, the speaker hopes that his journey towards death, represented in the poem as a journey out to sea, takes place at high tide, when the tide "moving seems asleep" because it is "Too full for sound and foam." In other words, at high tide the water will be smoother and calmer, as the poet hopes his death will be also. The tide here is a fitting symbol for the transition from life to death, because the tide is controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon, thus implying that the speaker's death is inevitable and also that the speaker feels pulled towards his death.In the third stanza, the speaker references the "dark" which will follow sunset. The dark here is a symbol of death and implies that the speaker expects death to be perhaps something like a void.In the final stanza, there are references to water to symbolize the inevitable flow of time. The speaker refers to "Time and Place" as a "bourne," meaning a small stream. He then says that this stream will flow into a "flood" which "may bear (him) far." The flood that the stream flows into here symbolizes the all-consuming nature of death. For every man, the poem implies, the stream of time will eventually flow into and become an all-consuming flood, which in turn will pull each man down to his death.​</h2><br />

                            18. "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" is a concept devised by the philosopher to ruminate on the nature of belief versus knowledge. The allegory states that there exists prisoners chained together in a cave. ... The prisoners watch these shadows, believing them to be real. Plato posits that one prisoner could become free</p><p></p><p>Who are the prisoners in the cave? The prisoners represent humans, particularly people who are immersed in the superficial world of appearances. ... In his allegory, Plato discusses a type of prisoner that is freed from their chains. Plato believes that these freed prisoners are the philosophers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In Plato's “Allegory of the Cave”, the cave, chains, and fire are used to demonstrate what prisoners lacked. Within Plato's Allegory the cave, chains, and fire represent the prisoners limitation to knowledge, free will, and truth</p><p></p><p>But the prisoners think that he is dangerous because the information that he tells them is so abstract and opposed to what they know. The prisoners choose not to be free because they are comfortable in their own world of ignorance, and they are hostile to people who want to give them an alternative view of the world.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            26. what is the meaning behind the flag of the philippines?
The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle which symbolizing liberty, equality and fraternity. A horizontal blue stripe symbolize peace, truth, and justice and a horizontal red stripe for patriotism and valor. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each rays represents a Philippine province. At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed anf golden-yellow star, each of it represents one of the country's three main island groups which is; Luzon, Visayas (though originally referring to Panay) and Mindanao. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.</h2><br />

I represent courage and bravery Even love symbolssuch as heart and roses are colored red."The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my yellow exemplifiedby the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth Without me, only the eye-glaringones remain"What outlandish claimst interposed the color Orange. "Sunrise is orange, notyellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at theripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange"Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to mycolor, declared the color Green. "I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fieldsand the forests is the greenery provide I am the most important colorThe color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, "What can be moreexpansive than the sky and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and thedeepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings andedensive spacesThe color Indigo came out with the statement, 'You talk about wide areas. I hopeyou realize that the largest area in the world is silence, and I represent thatdimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in thedeepest of feelings.Guide Questions:1. What characteristics of the colors can be compared to the youth of today?2. To what color do you compare yourself? Why?3.

                            29. choices:listening for inferring meaninglistening for Predicting contentlistening for gistlistening for details1. Imagine you are a detective taking a closer look at those buildings you saw earlier on as a superhero. This time, rather than taking in the big picture, you're looking for something specific and rejecting anything that does not match what's on your list.2. When listening, it is also possible to get the ‘whole picture’ but with one crucial difference: information comes in a sequence. And in that sequence of information, there are content words (the nouns, adjectives and verbs) that can help you form that picture.3. Imagine you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds, and thunder. What do you imagine he is about to tell you?4. Imagine you are a tourist in a country whose language you do not speak. In a restaurant, you hand over a credit card to pay for the bill, but the server seems to say something apologetic in response. Even though you don't understand his words, you can probably conclude that the restaurant doesn't take credit cards, and you need to pay with cash instead.​</h2><br />

                            30. "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!</h2><br />
