                                            ACTIVITY #2: Below are two-body paragraphs of two readings that both approach the same topic with two different discipline-specific tactics. Read each passage and answer the following questions about the intended audience, purpose, and differences in the readings.A. There are many different methods of camouflage Octopi and lizards match the color and texture of their skins with nearby rocks and vegetation to blend into the background, and manmade hunting gear is painted or woven to do the same thing. Zebras have wild stripes that disrupt their outlines, especially when they move in groups, and so did dazzle painted warships in World War I. Moths and caterpillars are shaped like leaves - and twigs to fool predators, while cell phone towers are built like trees to hide their industrial cutter from neighbors Gazelles and whales have counter-shaded sides that flatten and minimize rounded shapes, as do color-blocked dressesB. Applying the razzle dazzle idea took a lot more than handing sailors buckets of paint and letting them have it First, a wooden model of each ship was built to scale and then handed off to artists who designed and painted individualized patterns. Next, the dazzled model was placed next to a matching one painted plain gray and then the two were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed. After the pattern was approved, precise plans of the color scheme were drafted and sent to where the actual ship was docked.1. Who is the intended audience for passage A and B? 2. What is the intended purpose of passage A and B? 3. What are the differences in organization between passage A and B? ​</a>

There are many different methods of camouflage.  Octopi and lizards match the color and texture of their skins to nearby rocks and plants to blend into the background, and man-made hunting gear is painted or woven to do the same.  Zebras have wild stripes that disrupt their outlines, especially when they move y6in groups, and so do warships that were brightly painted during the First World War.  Moths and caterpillars shape leaves and twigs to fool predators, while cell phone towers are built like trees to hide their industrial waste from neighbors.  Gazelles and whales have counter-shaded edges that flatten and minimize rounded shapes, as do color-blocked dresses.B. Applying the razzle dazzle idea took more than just giving sailors buckets of paint and letting them go this. First, a wooden model of each ship was made to scale and then passed to artists who designed and painted individual patterns. Next, the dazzling model was placed next to a matching one painted in plain gray and then both were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed. After the pattern was approved, accurate color scheme plans were made and sent to where the actual ship was docked.1. Who is the intended audience for excerpts A and B?2.

                                            ACTIVITY #2: Below are two-body paragraphs of two readings that both approach the same topic with two different discipline-specific tactics. Read each passage and answer the following questions about the intended audience, purpose, and differences in the readings. A. There are many different methods of camouflage Octopi and lizards match the color and texture of their skins with nearby rocks and vegetation to blend into the background, and manmade hunting gear is painted or woven to do the same thing. Zebras have wild stripes that disrupt their outlines, especially when they move in groups, and so did dazzle painted warships in World War I. Moths and caterpillars are shaped like leaves - and twigs to fool predators, while cell phone towers are built like trees to hide their industrial cutter from neighbors Gazelles and whales have counter-shaded sides that flatten and minimize rounded shapes, as do color-blocked dresses B. Applying the razzle dazzle idea took a lot more than handing sailors buckets of paint and letting them have it First, a wooden model of each ship was built to scale and then handed off to artists who designed and painted individualized patterns. Next, the dazzled model was placed next to a matching one painted plain gray and then the two were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed. After the pattern was approved, precise plans of the color scheme were drafted and sent to where the actual ship was docked. 1. Who is the intended audience for passage A and B? 2. What is the intended purpose of passage A and B? 3. What are the differences in organization between passage A and B? ​​</a>

Read each passage and answer the following questions about the intended audience, purpose, and differences in the readings.A. There are many different methods of camouflage Octopi and lizards match the color and texture of their skins with nearby rocks and vegetation to blend into the background, and manmade hunting gear is painted or woven to do the same thing. Zebras have wild stripes that disrupt their outlines, especially when they move in groups, and so did dazzle painted warships in World War I. Moths and caterpillars are shaped like leaves - and twigs to fool predators, while cell phone towers are built like trees to hide their industrial cutter from neighbors Gazelles and whales have counter-shaded sides that flatten and minimize rounded shapes, as do color-blocked dressesB. Applying the razzle dazzle idea took a lot more than handing sailors buckets of paint and letting them have it First, a wooden model of each ship was built to scale and then handed off to artists who designed and painted individualized patterns. Next, the dazzled model was placed next to a matching one painted plain gray and then the two were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed. After the pattern was approved, precise plans of the color scheme were drafted and sent to where the actual ship was docked.1. Who is the intended audience for passage A and B? 2.

Applying the razzle dazzle idea took more than just giving sailors buckets of paint and letting them go this. First, a wooden model of each ship was made to scale and then passed to artists who designed and painted individual patterns. Next, the dazzling model was placed next to a matching one painted in plain gray and then both were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed.

                            23. ACTIVITY #2: Below are two-body paragraphs of two readings that both approach the same topic with two different discipline-specific tactics. Read each passage and answer the following questions about the intended audience, purpose, and differences in the readings. A. There are many different methods of camouflage Octopi and lizards match the color and texture of their skins with nearby rocks and vegetation to blend into the background, and manmade hunting gear is painted or woven to do the same thing. Zebras have wild stripes that disrupt their outlines, especially when they move in groups, and so did dazzle painted warships in World War I. Moths and caterpillars are shaped like leaves - and twigs to fool predators, while cell phone towers are built like trees to hide their industrial cutter from neighbors Gazelles and whales have counter-shaded sides that flatten and minimize rounded shapes, as do color-blocked dresses B. Applying the razzle dazzle idea took a lot more than handing sailors buckets of paint and letting them have it First, a wooden model of each ship was built to scale and then handed off to artists who designed and painted individualized patterns. Next, the dazzled model was placed next to a matching one painted plain gray and then the two were placed in front of various simulated backgrounds of water and sky. Designers studied the pair through periscopes to judge how well the camouflage worked and adjusted as needed. After the pattern was approved, precise plans of the color scheme were drafted and sent to where the actual ship was docked. 1. Who is the intended audience for passage A and B? 2. What is the intended purpose of passage A and B? 3. What are the differences in organization between passage A and B? ​​</h2><br />
