                                            Martina is a seamstress. She has worked in the garment manufacturing industry since shedropped from college. After a few years, she decided to resign from the factory to beself-employed. She set up a small shop in their house where she accepted sewing jobs fromfriends and relatives. During the first few months of her shop, she did all the work by herself.She purchased the fabrics directly from the wholesalers to minimize the cost and to ensurethat she would get the best designs with the best quality. After purchasing the fabric, shewould lay the pattern carefully to ensure that the grainline is parallel with the selvage toefficiently use the fabric. The next thing she would do was to mark the pattern on paper, andthen she would fix it to the fabric using pins and adhesives. After that, she would cut thefabric manually, then sew it based on the pattern. She would then package the finishedproduct and wait for the customer to pick it up after a few days.Since she produced high-quality outputs, she became popular in the area. Hence, she gainedmore customers. Her work increased from two to five dresses per week, so she decided tohire a new seamstress. Together, they were able to produce eight to ten clothes per weekwith a total of 40 per month. They barely had any sleep to produce this number of clothes, asthey had to work day in, day out to finish on time. Thus, Martina decided to hire three moreworkers. All five of them had to do all the process to finish a product. They had a great team.With Martina as the leader, it seems like they were a family rather than co-workers since theycommunicated informally, and there was no rule or policies except that they were expectedto report on time and do the job excellently.As Martina’s business grew, she is now thinking of expanding their company’s size. She hiredyou to give her advice on this.            1. In the given scenario, what is the appropriate organizational structure design for
Martina, given that her business grew.2. Do you think that the number of employees Martina has is appropriate? Why or why
not?3. Is there standardization present in the organization? Why is it important in the said
case?4. Why would it be necessary for the organization to change its organizational
structure? Explain your answer.​</a>

During the first few months of her shop, she did all the work by herself.She purchased the fabrics directly from the wholesalers to minimize the cost and to ensurethat she would get the best designs with the best quality. After purchasing the fabric, shewould lay the pattern carefully to ensure that the grainline is parallel with the selvage toefficiently use the fabric. The next thing she would do was to mark the pattern on paper, andthen she would fix it to the fabric using pins and adhesives. After that, she would cut thefabric manually, then sew it based on the pattern. She would then package the finishedproduct and wait for the customer to pick it up after a few days.Since she produced high-quality outputs, she became popular in the area. Hence, she gainedmore customers. Her work increased from two to five dresses per week, so she decided tohire a new seamstress. Together, they were able to produce eight to ten clothes per weekwith a total of 40 per month. They barely had any sleep to produce this number of clothes, asthey had to work day in, day out to finish on time. Thus, Martina decided to hire three moreworkers. All five of them had to do all the process to finish a product. They had a great team.With Martina as the leader, it seems like they were a family rather than co-workers since theycommunicated informally, and there was no rule or policies except that they were expectedto report on time and do the job excellently.As Martina’s business grew, she is now thinking of expanding their company’s size.
