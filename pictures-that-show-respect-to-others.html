                            22. Share your Thoughts &amp; Feelings Suggested Time Allotment: 5 minutes We are accustomed to show respect to other people especially to those who are older than us. Look at the following picture. What if the ones we need to show respect for are the people who are much younger than us? Answer the given questions on a clean sheet of paper or bond paper. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We need to show respect to people who are younger than us because we are their role models. Young people look up to older people, some even copy our actions. Younger people are like mirrors, they will most likely reflect our treatment towards them. If we treat them with respect, they’d treat you with respect too. But if you don’t respect them, they won’t respect you too they might show respect but behind your back, they won’t.</p><br />
