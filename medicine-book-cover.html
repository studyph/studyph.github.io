                                            Directions: Which of these is a text type that explains? Draw a check mark (1) before each number. 1. Long, long time ago, Arojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinary mortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tears turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as lasting proof of his grief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills. 2. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocoloate Hills are probably Bohol's most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the the pyramids in Egypt. 3. The hills are no less than 12268 in number. Uniform in shape, they are between 30 and 50 meters high. They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived. 4. If you wish to get to the Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. from Tagbiliran, you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going to carmen. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about kilometers before the town of Carmen. Drom there,have a 10-minute walk along a road winding up to the complex.5.Our forests are among our country's important natural resourers We depend on them for our timber products.

                                            1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

3. Mango float is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. Here are the steps to follow to prepare it. Prepare a rectangular glass dish with or without a lid. In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor’s degree with the highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated against by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24; he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of “Excellent.”

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

                            5. Directions: Which of these is a text type that explains? Draw a check mark (1) before each number. 1. Long, long time ago, Arojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinary mortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tears turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as lasting proof of his grief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills. 2. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocoloate Hills are probably Bohol's most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the the pyramids in Egypt. 3. The hills are no less than 12268 in number. Uniform in shape, they are between 30 and 50 meters high. They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived. 4. If you wish to get to the Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. from Tagbiliran, you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going to carmen. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about kilometers before the town of Carmen. Drom there,have a 10-minute walk along a road winding up to the complex.5.Our forests are among our country's important natural resourers We depend on them for our timber products.

                            15. 1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor’s degree with the highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated against by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24; he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of “Excellent.”

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

                        <p><strong>Answer:This one’s fairly simple. A metaphor does not use “like” or “as” to make a comparison. If those words are used, the description is a simile. Except for that slight difference, metaphors and similes are identical. So, for example, if her hair is like spun gold, that’s a simile. If her hair was spun gold, that’s a metaphor.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The simile simply makes it clear that the two objects are not literally the same. However, because of that extra clarification, a simile is limited. It is difficult to extend a simile (check out the upcoming lesson on “extended metaphor”) and your reader will not call an image to mind as fully.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Hyperbole</strong></p><p><strong>While a metaphor can certainly be hyperbolic, the two forms of description aren’t identical. If I say that I was stuck in traffic for eternity (when it was actually closer to an hour), I’m using a direct, non-literal comparison to evoke the emotion of the situation — which you’ll recall is a core part of the metaphor’s definition. However, the hyperbole is using a comparison that is clearly inaccurate to the situation being described. It’s that extreme inaccuracy, in fact, that gives it some extra oomph.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>If, on the other hand, I were to say that the freeway had turned into a junkyard for cars that had lost their ability to move — or that the procession of cars was a great army of ants that had been drenched with Raid — those would be metaphors.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Euphemism</strong></p><p><strong>Reverse Euphamisms: XKCD</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>A euphemism is meant to be an incomplete description. For example, when I say, she was “great with child” or that he “passed away,” I’m describing certain elements of the activities or states that I’m referencing. She really is great, in the sense of being quite large, because of the child. He really is away, and his time or presence here has passed. However, what we’re actually referencing is a step beyond what’s been described.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Euphemisms, in short, give a partially accurate description and leave something out. This is typically done with the assumption that the listener will understand the missing part. However, it’s worth noting that some euphemisms are also metaphors. When a couple are “doing the horizontal polka” or a man “pitches a tent,” we’re making a direct, non-literal comparison that involves a wild metaphoric leap.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>A Special Note on Personification and Symbol:</strong></p><p><strong>These two other forms of figurative language are sometimes seen as distinct from metaphor. However, despite some differences in purpose, the root functionality is the same. That’s why I personally see personification and symbolism as a sub-section of metaphor rather than as distinct categories.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>While we’ll cover these sub-types of metaphor in later entry, here’s a quick refresher on the terms:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Personification is any time you give human-like traits to non-human (and especially to non-living) subjects. As one example, Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” describes “golden daffodils […] dancing in the breeze.” Clearly, daffodils don’t actually “dance,” but the metaphoric description communicates something substantial about both the action of the flower and the emotional experience of the scene.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Symbolism is the use of a specific object within a story that represents another object, person, type of person, or concept. For example, in Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Raven,” it’s fairly clear that the raven represents loss and death. The function of symbolism runs parallel to that of extended metaphors, so we’ll discuss symbols at greater length when we get to the extended metaphor entry.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
