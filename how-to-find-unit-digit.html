LelinaWhen I was in grade school, my Home Economics teacher, Mrs. Sanchez told me to go to the H.E. building. I was wondering why she asked me to go there. So, when the bell rang for recess time, I ran towards the H.E. building. I saw a man, pulling out trays full of nutriban from the man-made oven. Mrs. Sanchez instructed me to count all the nutribans on the table. After counting, I reported her how many nutribans were on the table. Suddenly, she handed me a paper bag with four big hot nutribans I went to my classroom with a big smile on my face.Selection 5The PhilanthropistBy Cynthia Q.

This response is super late :&lt;&lt;</p><br /><p>This problem can be answered using the sum of an arithmetic sequence. </p><p>first term: A₁ = 17</p><p>last term: An = 897</p><p>common difference: d = 10</p><br /><p>We can rewrite the last term as:</p><p>897 = A₁ + (n - 1)(d)</p><p>897 = 17 + 10(n - 1)</p><p>880 = 10n - 10</p><p>890 = 10n</p><p>n = 89</p><br /><p>Now, we can compute for the sum. The formula for the sum is:</p><p>Sn = (A₁ + An)(n/2)</p><p>S₈₉ = (17 + 897)(89/2)</p><p>S₈₉ = (914)(89/2)</p><p><strong>S₈₉ = 40, 673</strong></p><br /><p>Hope this helps! ^_^</p><br />

LelinaWhen I was in grade school, my Home Economics teacher, Mrs. Sanchez told me to go to the H.E. building. I was wondering why she asked me to go there. So, when the bell rang for recess time, I ran towards the H.E. building. I saw a man, pulling out trays full of nutriban from the man-made oven. Mrs. Sanchez instructed me to count all the nutribans on the table. After counting, I reported her how many nutribans were on the table. Suddenly, she handed me a paper bag with four big hot nutribans I went to my classroom with a big smile on my face.Selection 5The PhilanthropistBy Cynthia Q.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can help you with this problem. I assume you want to find the ages of S and C in terms of x, where x is the common factor of their ages. To do this, we need to use the ratio and the given information. Let’s write the ratio as:</p><p></p><p>S/C = 3/2</p><p></p><p>This means that S is 3 times some number x, and C is 2 times some number x. So we can write:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x C = 2x</p><p></p><p>Now, we are given that five years later, the sum of their ages will be 40. That means:</p><p></p><p>(S + 5) + (C + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Substituting S and C with 3x and 2x, we get:</p><p></p><p>(3x + 5) + (2x + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Simplifying and solving for x, we get:</p><p></p><p>5x + 10 = 40 5x = 30 x = 6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the value of x is 6. To find the ages of S and C, we just need to plug in x into the expressions for S and C:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x = 3 × 6 = 18 C = 2x = 2 × 6 = 12</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the age of S is 18 years and the age of C is 12 years.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
