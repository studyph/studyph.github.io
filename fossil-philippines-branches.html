The Constitution grants the President authority to appoint his Cabinet. These departments form a large portion of the country's bureaucracy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Hope it's help</p>THE EXECUTIVE BRANCHI. President of the Philippines<p>Article VII, Section 1, of the 1987 Constitution vests executive power on the President of the Philippines. The President is the Head of State and Head of Government, and functions as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. As chief executive, the President exercises control over all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices. The President of the Philippines is elected by direct vote by the people for a term of six years. He may only serve for one term and is ineligible for reelection. The term of the President of the Philippines starts at noon of the 30th day of June after the election.</p>II. Qualifications<p>The qualifications for an individual aspiring to become the President of the Philippines are outlined in Article VII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution. According to the constitution, an individual may become President provided he meets the following criteria:</p><p>a. natural born Filipino;</p><p>b. a registered voter;</p><p>c. must be able to read and write;</p><p>d. 40 years of age at the day of the election; and</p><p>e. must have resided in the Philippines ten years before the election is held.</p>III. Power of the President<p>1. <strong>Power of control over the executive branch. </strong>The President of the Philippines has the mandate of control over all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices. This includes restructuring, reconfiguring, and appointments of their respective officials. The Administrative Code also provides for the President to be responsible for the abovementioned offices’ strict implementation of laws.</p><p>2. <strong>Ordinance power. </strong>The President of the Philippines has the power to give executive issuances, which are means to streamline the policy and programs of an administration. There are six issuances that the President may issue.</p>They are the following as defined in the Administrative Code of 1987:<p>• <strong>Executive orders</strong> — Acts of the President providing for rules of a general or permanent character in implementation or execution of constitutional or statutory powers shall be promulgated in executive orders.</p><p>• <strong>Administrative orders</strong> — Acts of the President which relate to particular aspects of governmental operations in pursuance of his duties as the administrative head shall be promulgated in administrative orders.</p><p>• <strong>Proclamations </strong>— Acts of the President fixing a date or declaring a status or condition of public moment or interest, upon the existence of which the operation of a specific law or regulation is made to depend, shall be promulgated in proclamations which shall have the force of an executive order.</p><p>• <strong>Memorandum orders</strong> — Acts of the President on matters of administrative detail, or of subordinate or temporary interest which only concern a particular officer or government office shall be embodied in memorandum orders.</p><p>• <strong>Memorandum circulars </strong>— Acts of the President on matters relating to</p><p>internal administration, which the President desires to bring to the attention of all or some of the departments, agencies, bureaus, or offices of the government, for information or compliance, shall be embodied in memorandum circulars.</p><p>• <strong>General or special orders </strong>— Acts and commands of the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines shall be issued as general</p><p>or special orders.</p><p>3. <strong>Power over aliens.</strong> The President of the Philippines has certain powers over non-Filipinos in the Philippines. The powers he may exercise over foreigners in the country are as follows:</p><p>• The chief executive may have an alien in the Philippines deported from the country after due process.</p><p>• The President may change the status of a foreigner, as prescribed by law, from a non- immigrant status to a permanent resident status without necessity of visa.</p><p>• The President may choose to overrule the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration before their decision becomes final and executory (after 30 days of the</p><p>issuance of the decision). The Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration has jurisdiction over all deportation cases.</p><p>• The president is also mandated by the Administrative Code of 1987 to exercise powers as recognized by the generally accepted principles of international law.</p><br />

                            9. Fossils are classified according to how they are formed. How will you help preservethe different fossils found here in the Philippines? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fossils exhibit a mosaic of so-called primitive and derived characteristics. The primitive aspects call to mind our ancient ancestors such as Australopithecus afarensis, the species to which the famous 3.1-million-year-old Lucy skeleton belongs; the derived ones resemble H. sapiens. Looking at the teeth, for example, the premolars of H. luzonensis are large and one of them has an extra tooth root—primitive features. The molars, in contrast, are very small and strikingly modern. Together those dental traits are “a very special combination that doesn’t exist in any of the comparative samples we studied,” Détroit observes. </p><br />

                            21. 5 FOSSIL FUEL DEPOSITS THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE PHILIPPINES​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippines’ demand for electrical energy in 2013 represents a 42.17% increase from 2012[citation needed], when the demand for energy was at 52,941 GWh.[6] It is expected that the country’s demand for power will increase as the Philippines’ population and economy continue to grow.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Philippines’ current energy mix highly favors fossil fuels, with coal, natural gas, and oil, accounting for 73.56% of the country's total electrical energy needs,[6] primarily due to their low cost.[7]
</p><p>
</p><p>The Philippines's most heavily used energy source is coal.[6] Of the country’s 75,266 GWh electrical energy demand in 2013, 32,081 GWh or approximately 42.62% was sourced from coal. This heavy dependence on coal is further apparent by the high number of coal-fired power plants in the country. As of March 2016, there were 32 coal-fired power generation facilities connected to the energy grid.[8][9][10] These facilities are spread throughout the country, although most of them are in Luzon and Visayas. The number of coal-fired power plants in the country is set to increase by 25 by the year 2030 to keep up with the Philippines’ growing energy demands.[11]
</p><p>
</p><p>Besides coal, the Philippines is also heavily dependent on natural gas[citation needed]. The Philippines produced 18,791 GWh of electricity from natural gas in 2013.[6] This corresponded to 24.97% of the Philippines’ electrical energy needs during this period. As of March 2016, there were a total of 13 natural gas generation facilities connected to the energy grid,[8][9][10] 12 of which are in Luzon and one of which is in Cebu on Visayas.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Philippines also generates a significant amount of electrical energy from oil, albeit to a lesser degree than compared to coal and natural gas. In 2013, the Philippines sourced 5.97% of its energy from oil-based sources.[6] As of March 2016, there were a total of 212 gas and diesel-powered facilities in the Philippines.[8][9][10] The large number of oil-powered power plants is a result of a lower per plant output compared to coal and natural gas. Oil-powered power plants can be found dispersed across several provinces in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.</p><br />

                        <p>The government framework of the
Philippines involves three sovereign yet interdependent branches.</p>

<p>1.    
Legislative branch. This branch creates the laws
and its power resides in the Congress which consists the Senate and the House
of Representatives. </p>

<p>2.    
Executive branch. This is the law-enforcing body
headed by the president of the Philippines. </p>

<p>3.    
Judicial branch. This is the law-interpreting
body. It is system of courts headed by the Supreme Court that interpret,
enforce, or nullify laws when disputes arise.</p><br />
