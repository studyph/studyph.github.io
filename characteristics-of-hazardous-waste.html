Nonhazardous waste doesn't have to be labeled in any special way. 2. The purpose of keeping records is to provide evidence that the waste is stored according to the procedures. 3. Train employees in the emergency response procedures that are appropriate for your site. 4. To be able to handle the waste properly, the company first needs to determine whether the waste is hazardous or not, and whether handling of that particular waste is regulated by legislation. 5. The company is responsible for its hazardous waste forever. 6. Waste can be in solid or liquid form, so it is not important to store it according to its characteristics. 7. Inappropriate strategy will incorporate the flexibility to accommodate changes in legislation, raw materials, ice differentials, and customer expectations. 8. All employees who have any role in handling, storing, or otherwise managing hazardous waste is not a necessary step for ensuring compliance with hazardous waste rules. 9. Hazardous waste should not be stored in a sturdy, leak-proof container that is kept closed when not adding or removing waste. 10. In the process of implementing a waste management system, the training can be conducted by co- workers who have worked on the creation of the waste management plan.​</h2><br />
