                                            What are The Opportunity and Threats of an environment and markets •(An opportunity) is any favourable situation in the organisation's environment. It is usually a trend or change of some kind or an overlooked need that increases demand for a product or service and permits the firm to enhance its position by supplying it.•(A threat) is any unfavourable situation in the organisation's environment that is potentially damaging to its strategy. The threat may be a barrier, a constraint, or anything external that might cause problems, damage or injury.OR MAYBE THIS•External opportunities provide an organization with a means to improve its performance and competitive advantage in a market environment. Some opportunities can be foreseen, such as being able to expand a franchise into a new city, while some may fall into your lap, such as another country opening up its market to foreign business.If you can think far enough ahead, you may even be able to create some opportunities, like a chess master being able to calculate the checkmate of his opponent in five moves just by looking at the board. For example, you may be able to see the potential of new products that can be developed from emerging technology.•External threats are anything from your organization's outside environment that can adversely affect its performance or achievement of its goals. Ironically, stronger organizations can be exposed to a greater level of threats than weaker organizations, because success breeds envy and competition to take what your organization has achieved.Examples of external threats include new and existing regulations, new and existing competitors, new technologies that may make your products or services obsolete, unstable political and legal systems in foreign markets, and economic downturns. Sometimes you can turn a threat into an opportunity, such as a new technology that may displace one of your key products but also provides an opportunity for new product development.​</a>

                            11. What are The Opportunity and Threats of an environment and markets •(An opportunity) is any favourable situation in the organisation's environment. It is usually a trend or change of some kind or an overlooked need that increases demand for a product or service and permits the firm to enhance its position by supplying it.•(A threat) is any unfavourable situation in the organisation's environment that is potentially damaging to its strategy. The threat may be a barrier, a constraint, or anything external that might cause problems, damage or injury.OR MAYBE THIS•External opportunities provide an organization with a means to improve its performance and competitive advantage in a market environment. Some opportunities can be foreseen, such as being able to expand a franchise into a new city, while some may fall into your lap, such as another country opening up its market to foreign business.If you can think far enough ahead, you may even be able to create some opportunities, like a chess master being able to calculate the checkmate of his opponent in five moves just by looking at the board. For example, you may be able to see the potential of new products that can be developed from emerging technology.•External threats are anything from your organization's outside environment that can adversely affect its performance or achievement of its goals. Ironically, stronger organizations can be exposed to a greater level of threats than weaker organizations, because success breeds envy and competition to take what your organization has achieved.Examples of external threats include new and existing regulations, new and existing competitors, new technologies that may make your products or services obsolete, unstable political and legal systems in foreign markets, and economic downturns. Sometimes you can turn a threat into an opportunity, such as a new technology that may displace one of your key products but also provides an opportunity for new product development.​</h2><br />

Relationship marketing also helps businesses understand what customers need and want so that they can tailor their products or services to meet those needs.</p><p></p><p>3. Marketing goals are a company’s overall objectives for its marketing activities, such as increasing sales or market share.
