                                            Study This Read the poem below and answer the questions that follow. STORM Jaime Jesus Borlagdan This is the weight stripped off by the sky mixed are the earth and water.If the disorder will be put back in place or traced, It would be like peeling away from a sticky embrace.Twisted are the limbs of electricity and branches, broken by strain slumped at each other.The leaves, the pebbles which tore the windows.Scratches, sap were the solidified tracks.Marks of the gushing path Of the ocean which walked the earth,Last night under the twister moon Whose beam was inward to its own gloom. The embrace of the Habagat, south wind, was a whipping tight Brutal pressure whose desire is to devour The world in one clenched hand. Almost without fear, almost close to be like love Which enveloped all. On the roads, in the veins The waited which was met By anxiety Wafted like untamed horses, At the clearing of dust The morning was a crumpled sheet. Remained was the soil naked. There in the falling of the flower To the dirt which nursed the root, Bloomed the scent Of the trampled upon grass. In the surfacing of light Clarity again is formed. In the shattered container this alone Is what is kept In the long digging This is what's in the pit. 1. What is the poem about? 2. How did find reading the poem? 3. How did the author describe the aftermath of the storm? 4. If you were the author, are you also going to illustrate the situation after a storm in same way? Why or why not? 5. How is his poem significant to the lives of the Bicolanos?​</a>

                                            Narl had struggled in gym all semester. It wasn’t his fault. He just wasn’t athletic, was all. He didn’t see what was so great about sports anyway. Why should he be expected to be good at sports, just because his father had been? And what did it mean to “participate”, and why did his gym teacher think he wasn’t doing it? He always puts on his uniform. He wore the proper shoes. He ran around when everyone else was running around. If he really didn’t understand what he was running around for, wasn’t that the teacher’s fault? All the way home, Narl considered his options. He could sign the report card himself. He could point out that he had gotten A’s in all of his academic subjects. He could write his father a poem about the absurdity of trying to measure and grade athletic ability... that was a laugh. Like his father would appreciate a poem! No, there was nothing he could say that was going to make this okay. What was it his father had told him when interims had come out? A boy who failed gym was destined to fail at life. There was nothing else for him to do. There was no way he could take this report card home. The time had come to take drastic measures. He’d been saving his birthday money for years, for just such a desperate situation. ____7. Narl and his father are much alike, and they understand each other well. ____8. Narl recognizes that there are many things he does well including athletics. ____9. Narl’s father is intolerant, unaccepting, and demanding. ____10. Narl plans to run away from home.​</a>

Listening
Test C. Directions: Read the poem. Then answer the questions that follow.
No problems in your life are here to stay forever,
They will pass away my dear,
So shrug away all the anger.
Don't complain even if your sad days are taking away the shine,
Smile my friend, because your happy days are just down the line.
Nobody said that life was going to be free from troubles and a perfect road,
They only promised,
It would teach you how to smile even in times of load.

about?
27. How should we react when we have problems?

                                            The world in which we live today,
Is different than before.
The virus has taken lives away,
of families they adore.
The fear of the unknown,
The worry of what will be,
Are in the minds of all of us,
As everyone can see.
The Doctors and all the Nurses,
First Responders and others too,
Are putting their lives in danger,
To care for me and you.
The compassion and the care they give,
The hours spent so the sick can live,
We thank you for all you do!
We practice social distancing,
We shop in a different way,
We were asked to stay at home for now,
When will this go away?

Then, answer the questions that follow.Do this in your notebook.The Land of Nodby Robert Louis StevensonFrom breakfast on through all the dayAt home among my friends I stay,But every night I go abroadAfar into the land of Nod.The strangest things are there for me,Both things to eat and things to see,And many frightening sights abroadTill morning in the land of Nod.All by myself I have to go,With none to tell me what to do--All alone beside the streamsAnd up the mountain-sides of dreams.Try as I like to find the way,I never can get back by day,Nor can remember plain and clearThe curious music that I hear.stainEDT1.

                                            Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

STORM Jaime Jesus Borlagdan This is the weight stripped off by the sky mixed are the earth and water.If the disorder will be put back in place or traced, It would be like peeling away from a sticky embrace.Twisted are the limbs of electricity and branches, broken by strain slumped at each other.The leaves, the pebbles which tore the windows.Scratches, sap were the solidified tracks.Marks of the gushing path Of the ocean which walked the earth,Last night under the twister moon Whose beam was inward to its own gloom. The embrace of the Habagat, south wind, was a whipping tight Brutal pressure whose desire is to devour The world in one clenched hand. Almost without fear, almost close to be like love Which enveloped all. On the roads, in the veins The waited which was met By anxiety Wafted like untamed horses, At the clearing of dust The morning was a crumpled sheet. Remained was the soil naked. There in the falling of the flower To the dirt which nursed the root, Bloomed the scent Of the trampled upon grass. In the surfacing of light Clarity again is formed. In the shattered container this alone Is what is kept In the long digging This is what's in the pit. 1. What is the poem about? 2. How did find reading the poem? 3.

                            5. Narl had struggled in gym all semester. It wasn’t his fault. He just wasn’t athletic, was all. He didn’t see what was so great about sports anyway. Why should he be expected to be good at sports, just because his father had been? And what did it mean to “participate”, and why did his gym teacher think he wasn’t doing it? He always puts on his uniform. He wore the proper shoes. He ran around when everyone else was running around. If he really didn’t understand what he was running around for, wasn’t that the teacher’s fault? All the way home, Narl considered his options. He could sign the report card himself. He could point out that he had gotten A’s in all of his academic subjects. He could write his father a poem about the absurdity of trying to measure and grade athletic ability... that was a laugh. Like his father would appreciate a poem! No, there was nothing he could say that was going to make this okay. What was it his father had told him when interims had come out?

No problems in your life are here to stay forever,
They will pass away my dear,
So shrug away all the anger.
Don't complain even if your sad days are taking away the shine,
Smile my friend, because your happy days are just down the line.
Nobody said that life was going to be free from troubles and a perfect road,
They only promised,
It would teach you how to smile even in times of load.

Is different than before.
The virus has taken lives away,
of families they adore.
The fear of the unknown,
The worry of what will be,
Are in the minds of all of us,
As everyone can see.
The Doctors and all the Nurses,
First Responders and others too,
Are putting their lives in danger,
To care for me and you.
The compassion and the care they give,
The hours spent so the sick can live,
We thank you for all you do!
We practice social distancing,
We shop in a different way,
We were asked to stay at home for now,
When will this go away?

The New NormalBefore, the world goes how it used to be,Where its people can move freely,Busy going in/out to work, school or own businesses,But all these changes suddenly.Oh! my world, what happened to us,With just a virus that changes a lot,The word normal becomes new normal,A kind of living that is new to all.Wearing a mask, social distancing,Disinfecting places, washing hands and sanitizing,Young and aging stayed at home,These are the preventive measures the government needs to do so.Now few a people are ranting,Because of lockdown and community quarantine,Some are bored, some are hungry,They have nothing to do but to be angry.A virus COVID-19 came so fast,How our education now? Someone asks,But the Department of Education did not stop and immediately respond,Different modalities in learning are offered in advance.Though children need to stay at home,Imparting of knowledge will continue to flow,We should work together and stand tall,And beat this pandemic and never let us fall.Answer the following question below.1.

Do you agree with the decision of the DepEd to continue schooling amidst thethreat of COVID-19?​</h2><br />
                        1. What is the poem all about?<p>It is about the new normal or what happened to us. The poem is also about the difference between The new normal and our living or how we live before.</p>2. Is there a difference in the way of living before and now? How?<p>Yes, To be exact there is a lot of difference in the way of our living before and now. First of all before we can all freely go to the places we wanted to go, we also enjoyed summer not like in the new normal we are stock in our houses. Second We need to follow a lot of protocols not like before that we can just move freely.</p>3. How would you describe the new normal way of living?<p>It is really hard since I'm a minor or let's say I'm under 18 I can't go out because of ECQ. its also really hard cause I am stock in our house and have nothing to do.</p>4. Is it easy to live in a new normal? Why? Why not?<p>No. Because there is a lot of difference in the way how we live before and how we live now. We are also Used on how we lived before the new normal.</p>5. Do you think it is right for some people to rant in the government? Why? Why  not?<p>No. they are also Affected like us and it will make no improvement and nothing will happen.</p>6. Does the government effort to fight the COVID-19 enough? How did you say so?<p>Maybe? Well I think they are doing their best and that's enough because they gave their best.</p>7. Do you agree with the decision of the DepEd to continue schooling amidst the  threat of COVID-19?​<p>No, Because as we all know COVID 19 is a deadly virus or there is a chance that you might die. So I guess not. If They will Continue Schooling I would just stay at home and do my modules.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hello there!

No one is there to keep him company so he only plays and talks with his toys. Every night at sleep, he dreams of being in a strange place that he imagines every day. He roams around and is surprised to see that no one is there to tell him what to do. It has streams and mountains but he cannot go back in the day, only by night when he sleeps.<p></p><p><strong>2.

                            30. Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i i wrong correct me pls </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Juan Francisco Salazar (Juan F. Salazar) is a Chilean anthropologist and a video maker. He is a senior lecturer in communication and media studies at the school of Communication Arts at the Center for Cultural Research. He is also a PhD in Communication and Media and a Master of Arts and Media and Cultural Studies, University of Western Sydney.</p><p></p><p>“Air Castle” is a poem that wrote by Mr. Juan F. Salazar. An inspiring poem that everyone can reflect on their own selves. A poem that really hard to understand on the first sight but it connects to reality of life. A great poem that one can led as a inspiration. One thing that we would appreciate and love.</p><p></p><p>The Poem want to make people realize that ambition is not easy to achieve you can always experience rejection; rejection is not always be the reason to quit it must be always the inspiration to continue and trying again your ambition in life until you achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The poem itself has been regarded by some to speak to man’s relationship with God. With lines such as: “Enthroned was he, like unto a God/ the depth he reached is dark to me”… In the last stanza of the poem, the speaker points out the reality behind the saying “try and try until you succeed”. A person should not give up on something because if he/she does, he/she will never achieve what he/she wants…</p><p></p><p>There is a question I hear and it somehow connects to the poem:”Do you think it is really important to aim for something?” For me, when you aim something you can earn a respect from others but the important thing when you achieve that you can learn not easily giving up on something…Air Castle is all about your ambitions in life, the things or you want to be you want to have in the future. Having ambition in life is not committing a mistake in life; it can be a mistake when you plan aim it in a wrong way… Ambition must always use by motivating you to make things successful… Ambition is always your guide in to fulfill what you want to be or to have… The poem gives a motivation to me to pursue my ambition without hesitation and negative thoughts in my mind that can let me think that I can’t achieve it… not only in having an ambition and achieving it but also loving what you are doing, because loving what you are doing is one of the key to achieve your ambition and making it in reality.</p><br />
