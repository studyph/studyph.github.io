                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Luke's Parables</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The purpose of this unit is acquaint youth with Luke's parables and a few from Matthew, but more importantly, the goal is to help the parables do what Jesus intended them to do. Jesus told parables to help his audience imagine a reality other than the one that they took to be normative and to respond to it by having a change of heart and seeking a closer relationship with God. That reality is the Kingdom of Heaven. Very often, our youth's early lessons on the parables led them to think of them as little morality stories, the lesson of which is "be good and you will be rewarded." Now it is time for them to hear the good news of the parables, the message of God's extravagant grace. They are invited into the topsy turvy reality of the kingdom in which those who serve and are treated as lowly or shameful or insignificant by the world are blessed and valued by God. They are shown a world in which the categories of neighbor and enemy or family member and outcast become meaningless, a world in which it is possible to imitate God and share abundance rather than hoard what the world deems valuable.</p><p></p><p>These lessons are designed to draw upon students' rich familiarity with stories that they loved in their childhood in order to find the same joy, but a more spiritual joy, in the parables.</p><p></p><p>Session One: Introduction to the Study of Parables and to Luke's Parables</p><p></p><p>Task One: Have students list as many parables as they can remember. It may help to have a chart prepared in advance with each gospel's name at the top of each column. I have provided an example of an incomplete chart of the parables below.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>        The parable of the barren fig tree is set alongside Jesus' condemnation of the temple. He is essentially using it to act our what will happen to the temple. Jesus judges the fig tree and the temple for lack of fruitfulness, and the fig tree is withered. The implication is that the temple will also be destroyed. </p><p></p><p>        Christ’s curse is a foreshadowing of what will happen to hypocrites — those Christians who, like the fig trees with leaves, promise fruit but fail to deliver.</p><p></p><p>        As Christians we must live consistently with what we say we believe. An unbelieving world is watching us; therefore, let it only see those who practice what they preach.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

The Healing of a boy with a Demon (Mk. 9:14-29)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Parable of the Great Feast (Luke 14: 16-24)
</p><p>&gt;The Parable of the Great Banquet
</p><p>15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
</p><p>
</p><p>16 Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. 17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
</p><p>
</p><p>18 “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’
</p><p>
</p><p>19 “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’
</p><p>
</p><p>20 “Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’
</p><p>
</p><p>21 “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’
</p><p>
</p><p>22 “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’
</p><p>
</p><p>23 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. 24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.
</p><p>2.The Cleansing of the Leper (Mk. 1:40-45)
</p><p>Mark 1:40-45 says, A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. “If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean,” he said. 41 Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out and touched him. “I am willing,” he said. “Be healed!” 42 Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed. 43 Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning: 44 “Don’t tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.” 45 But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn’t publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him.  </p><p>3.Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy
</p><p>14 When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them. 15 When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.
</p><p>
</p><p>16 “What is all this arguing about?” Jesus asked.
</p><p>
</p><p>17 One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, “Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won’t let him talk. 18 And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.[a] So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn’t do it.”
</p><p>
</p><p>19 Jesus said to them,[b] “You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”
</p><p>
</p><p>20 So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.
</p><p>
</p><p>21 “How long has this been happening?” Jesus asked the boy’s father.
</p><p>
</p><p>He replied, “Since he was a little boy. 22 The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.”
</p><p>
</p><p>23 “What do you mean, ‘If I can’?” Jesus asked. “Anything is possible if a person believes.”
</p><p>
</p><p>24 The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”
</p><p>
</p><p>25 When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil[c] spirit. “Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak,” he said. “I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!”
</p><p>
</p><p>26 Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
</p><p>
</p><p>28 Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, “Why couldn’t we cast out that evil spirit?”
</p><p>
</p><p>29 Jesus replied, “This kind can be cast out only by prayer</p><br />

Despite the late hour and difficulty, a buddy finally decides to aid his neighbor because of his relentless demands rather than because they are friends. This narrative emphasizes the importance of persevering in prayer.<br /><br />2. Jesus emphasizes the necessity of intercession, or requesting what we require. The widow and the unjust judge (Luke 18:1-8) and this reading of the friend at night are two wonderful examples of persistent begging in Luke. May we have the courage to ask and the freedom to receive the Lord's response to us as friends of the Lord (John 15:13-15). Many of us find it difficult to ask for anything for ourselves. It's sometimes simpler to ask for a favor on someone else's behalf. We know that God is the giver of all good gifts and that he will give us what is best for us. In the spirit of this Gospel reading, we pray for the faith to believe and the tenacity to keep asking.<br /><br />3. Prayer needs practice and endurance, as well as bravery and self-assurance. "Ask," "seek," and "knock" are all words that may be used to describe a situation. We may request the incorrect item, yet we will obtain what we require rather than what we desire. All prayer should be based on this confidence. We must never give up praying, according to Jesus. The Father is the source of limitless wealth, and he is eager to provide abundantly for our needs. However, we must first inquire. Lord, please assist me to confidently, expectantly, and cheerfully ask for mine and others' needs at this time.<br /><br />4. I remember moments when I begged for something and it was given to me, when I looked for something and it was discovered for me, when I knocked and it was opened for me. I recall times when I was not provided, when I was not found, and when the door remained closed. In all sincerity, I pray to the Lord for confidence and trust, as well as for the freedom to examine my connection with him. If I were a parent, I would completely grasp what Jesus is saying at the end of this verse. My loving Father, too, has granted me the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />5. In this parable, Jesus uses the example of a buddy who is averse to being bothered but gives in when pressed. The lesson is straightforward: keep trying and persevering until you succeed. 'The Holy Spirit will be given by the Father.' Do I express gratitude to the Father for his blessings? Do I express my gratitude for his gift? The Holy Spirit, according to Luke, is God's greatest gift to Christians and the source of all 'good things.' How often do I pray for a more powerful manifestation of the Holy Spirit in my heart and life?<br /><br />brainliest<br />

                            23. Describe the parable of the good samaritan ( Luke 10:25-37 )​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Parable of the Good Samaritan</p><p>In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus uses the example of the Jew and the Samaritan, who would not ordinarily have been friendly towards each other. However, out of all those who could have helped the Jew, only the Samaritan did. Jesus tells of a man who was travelling from Jerusalem to Jericho and was attacked by robbers on the way. He was badly beaten and left for dead.</p><p></p><p>The first person to pass the injured man was a priest, who crossed the road and continued walking.</p><p></p><p>The second person to pass the injured man was a Levite, a priest’s assistant. He also crossed the road and continued walking without helping the man.</p><p></p><p>The third person to come by was a Samaritan, a person from Samaria. The Samaritans were hated by the Jews. When the Samaritan saw the man, he took pity on him. He bandaged him and cleaned his wounds. He then put him on the back of his donkey and took him to an innkeeper, whom he paid to look after him.</p><p></p><p>The parable ends with Jesus giving a commandment to go out and do the same as the Samaritan had done. This teaching of loving one’s enemies is also reflected in Matthew's Gospel.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ehh correct nalang Kong Mali </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First there was a Jew who was robbed and beaten by bad men. A priest was going to the church to preach and he saw the Jew, he left after seeing the Jew. Then a Levite also saw the Jew the left. But there is a Samaritan with a donkey, he saw everything happened because he knew that bad omen, and the Samaritan take pity on the man, put some oil on where the Jew had some wounds and wrapped it by a clean cloth. Then, the man put the Jew on his donkey and brought the Jew to the nearest hospital. The Samaritan said to the owner that if there are few money he had not pay yet, he would come back.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>asan pic ture ng sasagutan</p>1. I learned a lot about The "Parable of the Pharosee and the Tax Collector", in Luke 18:9-14. I learned that Jesus desires to teach in people the value of prayer with the appropriate mindset. The Pharisees, who believe they are exceedingly virtuous and look down on others, are the target of this tale. Three times a day, Jews were required to pray, and many would go to the temple for private prayer.<br /><br />2. I learned a lot about The "Parable of the Talents", in Matthew 25:14-30. I learned that God gifted and entrusted us with blessings, He expects us to use our gifts wisely. He doesn't judge us all by the same standard, We will be held accountable, and We are called to grow in the Lord.<br /><br />3. The Parable of the Importunate Neighbour (or the Parable of the Late Night Friend) is a parable spoken by Jesus in Luke 11:5–8. This narrative emphasizes the importance of persevering in prayer. It's comparable to the Parable of the Unjust Judge, and various painters, including William Holman Hunt, have represented it.<br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The seed is the word of God,” Jesus says. (Luke 8:11) And the soil is the heart. That is a key to getting the sense of his illustration.</p><p></p><p>Of the seed sown on the trampled-down soil alongside the road, he explains: “The Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.” (Luke 8:12) In speaking of the seed sown on rocky ground, Jesus means the hearts of people who receive the word with joy but the word does not take root deep in their hearts. “After tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word,” they are stumbled. Yes, when “a season of testing” comes, perhaps opposition from family members or others, they fall away.—Matthew 13:21; Luke 8:13.</p><p></p><p>What of the seed that falls among the thorns? Jesus tells his disciples that this refers to people who have heard the word. These, however, are overcome by “the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches.” (Matthew 13:22) They had the word in their heart, but now it is choked and becomes unfruitful.</p><p></p><p>The last type of soil that Jesus comments on is the fine soil. This refers to those who hear the word and accept it into their heart, getting the real sense of it. With what result? They “bear fruit.” Because of their circumstances, such as age or health, not all can do the same; one produces 100 times more, another 60 times more, and another 30 times more. Yes, blessings in serving God come to “ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”—Luke 8:15.</p><br />
