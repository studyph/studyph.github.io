                                            CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</a>

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist.

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.

                            7. CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</h2><br />

                            8. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                            15. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.
