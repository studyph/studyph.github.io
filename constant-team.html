Ayon pa kay Atty. Foronda, mahigit dalawandaang tao na mula sa sa ibat ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaano maging ang mga pribadong individwal at mga katutubong Dumagat at Agta ang nagtutulong-tulong na upang suyurin ang kabundukan. Sa kanilang ginawang Search and Rescue Operation ay bigo pa rin ang mga ito na mahanap o matukoy man lang ang kinaroroonan ng Cessna 206 Plane kasama ang limang pasahero nito at isang piloto. Nakikipag-ugnayan na din umano ang Isabela Police Provincial Office sa pangunguna ni Provincial Director PCol. Julio Go sa Incident Management Team kung kinakailangan pa ng karagdagang PNP Personnel. Makapal pa rin anya utap sa ilang bahagi ng Sierra Madre Mountain Range na pangunahing dahilan kung bakit hindi makapasok ang mga drone at choppers ng Philippine Airforce sa kabundukan. Umaasa ang Incident Management Team na matatagpuan na ang nawawalang Cessna Plane dahil sa magandang lagay ng panahon di tulad sa mga nagdaang linggo na may mga pag-ulan na nakaapekto sa aerial search ng mga kasapi ng Tactical Operation Group 2 ng Philippine Air Force.​</a>

investigating company. You were asked to join a team assigned to
investigate a ‘hit and run’ case. The alleged suspect was captured by the
CCTV camera driving down a road leading to the place of incident. The
suspect denied the allegation, saying that he was then driving very slowly
with a constant speed. Because of the short time difference when he was
caught by the camera and when the accident happened, he insisted that it
was impossible that he would already be at the place when the crime
happened. But when you were viewing the scene again on the camera, you
noticed that his car was leaving oil spots on the road. When you checked
these spots on site, you found out that they are still evident. So you began
to wonder if the spots can be used to investigate the motion of the car of the
suspect and check whether he was telling the truth or not.</a>

Ayon pa kay Atty. Foronda, mahigit dalawandaang tao na mula sa sa ibat ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaano maging ang mga pribadong individwal at mga katutubong Dumagat at Agta ang nagtutulong-tulong na upang suyurin ang kabundukan. Sa kanilang ginawang Search and Rescue Operation ay bigo pa rin ang mga ito na mahanap o matukoy man lang ang kinaroroonan ng Cessna 206 Plane kasama ang limang pasahero nito at isang piloto. Nakikipag-ugnayan na din umano ang Isabela Police Provincial Office sa pangunguna ni Provincial Director PCol. Julio Go sa Incident Management Team kung kinakailangan pa ng karagdagang PNP Personnel. Makapal pa rin anya utap sa ilang bahagi ng Sierra Madre Mountain Range na pangunahing dahilan kung bakit hindi makapasok ang mga drone at choppers ng Philippine Airforce sa kabundukan. Umaasa ang Incident Management Team na matatagpuan na ang nawawalang Cessna Plane dahil sa magandang lagay ng panahon di tulad sa mga nagdaang linggo na may mga pag-ulan na nakaapekto sa aerial search ng mga kasapi ng Tactical Operation Group 2 ng Philippine Air Force.​</h2><br />

A fast-food restaurant is experiencing high turnover rates among its staff, resulting in constant shortages of workers during peak hours. The management team is struggling to keep up with the demand, and customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with long wait times and mistakes in their orders.</h2><br />
                        EMPLOYEE TURNOVER<p></p><p>Based on the case the company is  facing high turnover rates, resulting in constant worker shortages and <strong>frustrated customers. </strong>The 5 kinds of problem that I had identified in the case are high turnover rates, lack of employee retention strategies, poor management practices, <strong>customer dissatisfaction,</strong> and inefficient staffing practices. The management can resolve the issue by giving competitive wages and benefits, effective training and support, and addressing employee concerns. </p>PROBLEMS<p>1.<strong> Employee turnover is high</strong>- The main problem of the organization is that most of its employees are leaving the organization which results in a constant shortage of workers during peak hours</p><p><strong>2. No employee retention strategies</strong>-  The organization has no strategy to make their employee feel contented and happy so that they will stay in the organization.</p><p><strong>3. Poor Management practices</strong>- The management practices of the business is poor  which can lead to staff dissatisfaction and high turnover rates</p><p><strong>4. Customer Dissatisfaction- </strong> SInce there is no enough employees, most of the customers waited for their order for the long time which can make them feel dissatisfied which also resulted in decline in sales because there is no repeat purchase.</p><p><strong>5. Inefficient Staffing Practices- </strong>There is no scheduling of employees which cannot meet the customer demand.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p>PROBLEMS YOU SEE IN THE SCENARIO:3<p>Based on the questions, some of the problems and scenarios that can be found:</p>High Turnover Rates - One of the biggest problems in the scenario is the high turnover rates among the staff. Some of the reasons due to<strong> low pay,</strong> <strong>lack</strong> of benefits<strong>, poor</strong> working conditions, or even lack of opportunities for growth and development. This issue needs to be addressed immediately by the management team to retain their employees and reduce the costs associated with training new staff.Shortages of Workers - The<strong> lack </strong>of staff leads to longer waiting hours for customers which are in a hurry, which can result in negative customer experiences. It needs to be assess, implement <strong>strategies</strong> to ensure adequate number of staff that is available during peak hours. Hiring more staff, implementing flexible <strong>scheduling,</strong> and providing <strong>incentives</strong> to encourage employees to work during peak hours which some management overlook this problem.Customer satisfaction - The waiting game and mistakes in their order can  <strong>increase </strong>frustration. This can lead to negative reviews, reduced <strong>customer </strong>loyalty, and <strong>ultimately</strong> a decrease in revenues and capitals.Inefficient Processes - Inefficient processes may also <strong>contribute</strong> to the problems faced by the restaurant most of the time. For instance, if the kitchen is not <strong>organized, </strong>then the result is not that good, mistakes in orders and frustrated customer may increase.Lack of Employee Engagement - A lack of <strong>employee</strong> engagement can lead or may result to high turnover rates and poor service. <strong>Employees</strong> who are not interested in their work may not provide the best service to their<strong> customers. </strong><p></p><p></p><p>For more details about Management skills:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19174379</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />

investigating company. You were asked to join a team assigned to
investigate a ‘hit and run’ case. The alleged suspect was captured by the
CCTV camera driving down a road leading to the place of incident. The
suspect denied the allegation, saying that he was then driving very slowly
with a constant speed. Because of the short time difference when he was
caught by the camera and when the accident happened, he insisted that it
was impossible that he would already be at the place when the crime
happened. But when you were viewing the scene again on the camera, you
noticed that his car was leaving oil spots on the road. When you checked
these spots on site, you found out that they are still evident. So you began
to wonder if the spots can be used to investigate the motion of the car of the
suspect and check whether he was telling the truth or not.</h2><br />
