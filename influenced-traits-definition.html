In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the onethat the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. To measure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14.________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. pa help sa magaling dyan.. mas maganda ma perfect :)​</a>

When people are interested in exploring a problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a 1. ________________. In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the one that the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________ variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. Tomeasure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14. ________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. PA HELP PO HUHU​</a>

                                            What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</a>

                            12. What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</h2><br />
