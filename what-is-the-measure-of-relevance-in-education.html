Take note of information that will help you decide whether the report is valid, accurate, relevant and with adequate information. MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines was better able to address inequalities between men and women in 2013 than the year before. This is according to the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which ranks the Philippines 5th out of 136 countries in terms of progress in closing the male-female gender gap in economics, politics, education, and health. In 2012, the Philippines ranked 8th."Philippines is the only country in Asia and the Pacific that has fully closed the gender gap in both education and health," the report reads.The index measured gender disparities in education in terms of literacy and the ratio of men and women per education level. Health was measured in terms of life expectancy and the sex ratio at birth. The report – a project of the World Economic Forum – measures "results" rather than "input." The report focused on how the female population fared against the opposite gender, instead of gauging how well a country invested in female-friendly policies. "This year, the Philippines scores a higher ratio in the wage equality survey, improves its estimated earned income, and has a larger representation of female professional and technical workers," read the report.

Once developed, the jeof studying and learning will become easier and smarter.To help you establish good study habits that fit your personality, take timeread the topics below:1. Know what your dominant learning style is.Learning style refers to how an individual is able to learn and rememberinformation.a. Visual learners. Many authors and researchers like Dawna Markovaand Anne Powell tell that you learn best in seeing and showing.Learners who are visual learners tend to appreciate printed handoutsand resources that reinforce educational concepts. Writing downinformation will help process and remember it.b. Auditory learners choose verbal instruction. Some learners learnbest from hearing and speaking, and are comfortable listening andtalking and tend to engage easily in conversation.c. Tactile-kinesthetic learners prefer being physically engaged in thelearning process. Markova and Powell stipulated that these learnersare best engaged through experiencing and doing. They prefer towrite things down themselves and will remember best when they aredocumenting their own goals and progress.2. Create a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) goals.3. Make your study time a part of your routine. Know which time of the dayyou learn well.4. Establish your study zone. Some like a quiet place while others want a littlenoise. Use gadgets like laptops, cellphones and tablets wisely.​</a>

Take note of information that will help you decide whether the report is valid, accurate, relevant and with adequate information. MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines was better able to address inequalities between men and women in 2013 than the year before. This is according to the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which ranks the Philippines 5th out of 136 countries in terms of progress in closing the male-female gender gap in economics, politics, education, and health. In 2012, the Philippines ranked 8th."Philippines is the only country in Asia and the Pacific that has fully closed the gender gap in both education and health," the report reads.The index measured gender disparities in education in terms of literacy and the ratio of men and women per education level. Health was measured in terms of life expectancy and the sex ratio at birth. The report – a project of the World Economic Forum – measures "results" rather than "input." The report focused on how the female population fared against the opposite gender, instead of gauging how well a country invested in female-friendly policies. "This year, the Philippines scores a higher ratio in the wage equality survey, improves its estimated earned income, and has a larger representation of female professional and technical workers," read the report.
