Schiefele, and Scheneider (2001) stated that the ability to read is a cross-curricular competence 6. Hence, let us continuously improve our reading ability and discover for ourselves how reading can be beneficial to us. 7. In fact, the following are just three of many benefits in reading: can allow us to discover a lot of things can help us to succeed in school, and can guide us in handling real-life undertakings. 8. This finding is saddening for different educational institutions considering all their efforts to raise the literacy level of their students. 9. Moreover, reading can guide us in handling real-life undertakings. For instance, literary works can teach us "on how to how to behave to another person, how to talk gently, how to live a good life and how to be a good human being(Ghosh, 2018)".​</a>

Bias is present when an author is unfair or inaccurate in his or her presentationof something.2. You can usually make a very educated guess about the author's biases just bylooking at their educational, and career background.3. Implicit or unconscious bias operates outside of the person's awareness andcan be in direct contradiction to a person's belief and values.4. To determine what an author's bias is, the author may state directly some ofhis/her biases by telling the reader his/her opinions on a certain topic.5. It is not important to understand author's bias, whether it's a piece of writing, apainting, photograph-anything because it's the author's opinion or idea.​</a>
