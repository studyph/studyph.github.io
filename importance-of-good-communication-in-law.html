                                            Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, frombusiness leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy.It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strongbipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinksthis is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year,Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers andranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in timesof need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and thelonger-term certainty they deserve.We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis haspassed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just becausewe don't think it's good politics. Or just because the extremes in our parties don'tlike compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get importantwork done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, withoutlurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn'tgoverning - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligationto do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we'reAmericans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats andRepublicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of thiscountry we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekend.1.

                                            empowerment Analysis of these figures in relation to previous global gender gap reports may lead to the conclusion that the gap will finally close in a span of 82 years (World EconomicForum, 2016)The Philippines elected not one, but two women presidents in a span of less than 20 years. The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</a>

                                            Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                                            Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, frombusiness leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy.It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strongbipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinksthis is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year,Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers andranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in timesof need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and thelonger-term certainty they deserve.We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis haspassed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just becausewe don't think it's good politics. Or just because the extremes in our parties don'tlike compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get importantwork done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, withoutlurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn'tgoverning - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligationto do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we'reAmericans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats andRepublicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of thiscountry we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekend.1.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

The fact that electronic computers are now used for data processing has led the general public to believe that it is a mysterious, complicated science and that the computers are giant brains. Both of these ideas are false. A computer is basically just a high-speed adding machine that performs the functions it is told to. If the input data are varied even a little, the computer is unable to operate until it is programmed to accept the variations. The business operations it performs are impressive only because of the extremely high speed of manipulation, but most of these operations have been used for decades. Unlike man, the computer performs repetitive calculations without getting tired or bored.a. A computer is a high-speed adding machine.b. A computer is a mysterious giant brain.c. A computer is impressive because of its high speed.d. A computer is superior to man in many ways.2. In earlier days those who had overseas business which they believed should be discussed personally, took ship and set out across the briny deep. Once aboard they transacted their affairs, engaging in commercial and social matters or conducting government business. Today ships and passengers continue to sail the seven seas, and airplanes soar overhead. But above them all, words speed through the sky – telephone conversations quickly bring together in the most personal fashion people who are separated by thousands of miles.a. Overseas telephone service today is ruling out all need for overseas travel.b. Nothing can take the place of person-to-person conversation in settling business, social, and government problems.c. Many conversations which once required overseas travel can now be conducted by telephone.d. Even with modern overseas telephone service people continue to travel abroad by ship or by plane.3.

You may find, for example, that horse racing is legal in your state, but that you cannot legally play poker for money on your front porch; bookies may be prosecuted by state law, but they are supposed to purchase a federal license nonetheless; one church condemns gambling, while another raises money by sponsoring Bingo games. Gambling laws are inconsistent from state to state or even from town to town and are very difficult to enforce.a. Americans have negative attitudes toward gambling.b. Gambling laws are difficult to enforcec. Gambling laws are inconsistent from community to community.d. Churches do not have uniform ideas about gambling.4.

                            8. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, frombusiness leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy.It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strongbipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinksthis is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year,Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers andranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in timesof need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and thelonger-term certainty they deserve.We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis haspassed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just becausewe don't think it's good politics. Or just because the extremes in our parties don'tlike compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get importantwork done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, withoutlurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn'tgoverning - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligationto do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we'reAmericans first.

                            9. empowerment Analysis of these figures in relation to previous global gender gap reports may lead to the conclusion that the gap will finally close in a span of 82 years (World EconomicForum, 2016)The Philippines elected not one, but two women presidents in a span of less than 20 years. The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</h2><br />

                            12. Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                            22. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, frombusiness leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy.It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strongbipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinksthis is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year,Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers andranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in timesof need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and thelonger-term certainty they deserve.We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis haspassed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just becausewe don't think it's good politics. Or just because the extremes in our parties don'tlike compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get importantwork done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, withoutlurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn'tgoverning - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligationto do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we'reAmericans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats andRepublicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of thiscountry we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekend.1.

                            24. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Choose the statement that best summarizes the following passages. Write the letter of the correct answer on your notebook.1. The fact that electronic computers are now used for data processing has led the general public to believe that it is a mysterious, complicated science and that the computers are giant brains. Both of these ideas are false. A computer is basically just a high-speed adding machine that performs the functions it is told to. If the input data are varied even a little, the computer is unable to operate until it is programmed to accept the variations. The business operations it performs are impressive only because of the extremely high speed of manipulation, but most of these operations have been used for decades. Unlike man, the computer performs repetitive calculations without getting tired or bored.a. A computer is a high-speed adding machine.b. A computer is a mysterious giant brain.c. A computer is impressive because of its high speed.d. A computer is superior to man in many ways.2. In earlier days those who had overseas business which they believed should be discussed personally, took ship and set out across the briny deep. Once aboard they transacted their affairs, engaging in commercial and social matters or conducting government business. Today ships and passengers continue to sail the seven seas, and airplanes soar overhead. But above them all, words speed through the sky – telephone conversations quickly bring together in the most personal fashion people who are separated by thousands of miles.a. Overseas telephone service today is ruling out all need for overseas travel.b. Nothing can take the place of person-to-person conversation in settling business, social, and government problems.c. Many conversations which once required overseas travel can now be conducted by telephone.d. Even with modern overseas telephone service people continue to travel abroad by ship or by plane.3. The attitudes of Americans toward gambling are amazingly contradictory. You may find, for example, that horse racing is legal in your state, but that you cannot legally play poker for money on your front porch; bookies may be prosecuted by state law, but they are supposed to purchase a federal license nonetheless; one church condemns gambling, while another raises money by sponsoring Bingo games. Gambling laws are inconsistent from state to state or even from town to town and are very difficult to enforce.a. Americans have negative attitudes toward gambling.b. Gambling laws are difficult to enforcec. Gambling laws are inconsistent from community to community.d. Churches do not have uniform ideas about gambling.4. Tea is the world’s second most popular drink after water. Tea is a big part of the Chinese culture. A Chinese saying identifies the seven basic daily necessities as fuel, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea. According to Chinese legend, tea was invented accidentally by the Chinese Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 B.C. China is one of the main producers of tea, and tea remains China’s national drink.a. Why tea is so popularb. The importance of tea in the Chinese culturec. The health benefits of tead. Drinking water is good for you5. “If you want something done, give it to a busy person.” Initially that advice sounds strange, but people with energy and ambition often get things done. Throughout time, it has been proven that people with ambition accomplish things that others thought were impossible.
