 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

                            18. Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

                            20. Geography and politics led to the unity and disunity of the Greek city-states. When they were united, they could defeat even the largest of Empires. But when divided, they fall to themselves. As a nation that is also geographically and politically divided, how can the Philippines be one amidst the growing divisiveness in our society with the issues on fake news and "political colors"? What can you do that will help bring people together?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An empire is a "political unit" made up of several territories and peoples, "usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries".[1] The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) exercises political control over the peripheries.[2] Within an empire, there is non-equivalence between different populations who have different sets of rights and are governed differently.[3] Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state is an emperor; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).</p><p></p><p>There have been "ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign" Empires.[4] An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, which include territories that are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the Carthaginian Empire and British Empire.[4] Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses).[5] The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.[6]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>plssssss brainliest</p><br />

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />
