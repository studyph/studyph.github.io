                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As this challenging academic term begins, and some students are learning remotely, while others are heading back in person, we urge educators to pause and reflect on what worked — and didn’t — during remote learning last spring. While we eagerly await the moment when all schools can safely resume in person, we strongly caution against reverting back to the “normal” way of doing things. “Normal” was not working for so many students prior to COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>Since this remote learning experiment of 2020 upended typical school schedules and traditional approaches to teaching and learning, educators now have an opportunity to leverage key lessons and insights gained during this time to build a new normal that better supports student well-being, equity, and engagement with learning for all students during the next semester and beyond.</p><p></p><p>At Challenge Success, a school reform nonprofit affiliated with Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, we know that any school change process should begin by listening to the stakeholders who matter most — the students. So we reached out to some of the high school students who have participated in the Challenge Success School Program and asked what worked (or not) during remote learning and what they would like school leaders to know about their experiences last spring.</p><p></p><p>Their reflections, summarized below, are consistent with our SPACE framework and with the student-centered approaches and practices that research shows most effectively support student well-being and engagement with learning. We offer these as guiding principles for educators to use as they consider what schools might look like this fall, regardless of where school is happening.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pbrainliest</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>SALAMT SA POINTS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is the line between dying of something easily curable or living. Education is the difference between being an informed, enlightened citizen, capable of participating in governance and holding that government accountable on one hand versus being a pawn incapable of discerning demagoguery or tyranny on the other. Education is the chance to pursue interests because they are intellectually stimulating rather than a life of merely surviving. Education is a clearer view to truth, leverage to exceed personal biases, the ability to reach beyond myths and embrace whatever is found. Education is the tool by which one may grow, express, pursue, enjoy and then share what is learned with others. To stand on the shoulders of those who came before and see farther than any before, to lift up those who follow that they may see farther still.
</p><p>
</p><p>Consider this: All the brain capital and all the materials for all the engineering to build all the things we so readily use today is built using stuff that was always available right here on Earth. The tools needed to solve problems that beset humanity for centuries became footnotes in history once formal education became more widely available.
</p><p>
</p><p>The millennia humanity spent toiling in the mud, dying young, fighting over land and resources while wasting what was already at hand, century upon century of the “haves” forcing to ground the “have nots” for shortsighted gain was never actually necessary. All the confident religions espousing assured truth, all the vanity of rulers enforcing selfish goals, all the wars fought by “us” against “them”, all of that waste might never have been had there been education available to more people.
</p><p>
</p><p>Slavery, universal suffrage, enforced genital mutilation, witch’s hangings, inquisition, excommunication, crusading, apartheid, castes, gerrymandering, capitalist excess, communist waste, pogroms, poverty - all of these things are defeated with education.
</p><p>
</p><p>And yet these problems continue to limit humanity. We have not yet seen what can be accomplished when every last one of us receives the chance to succeed as far as our ability may take us. If we are ever to reach our potential as a species, education is our path forward.
</p><p>
</p><p>A child is born as I write this. All the potential of that new life is as yet unknown. Every day that new person lives, their potential rises or falls by the weight of the society, culture, government and people where they live. Education is the most efficient tool ever devised by humanity to ensure that child’s potential rises. All the successes that child may know, and humanity benefit with them, depend on that child’s chance to use their abilities to best effect. Education is an exponential increase in those chances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The coronavirus is spreading rapidly. We, as normal human beings who are not frontline workers, should always follow the quarantine protocols. Why? To help the nurses, doctors, basically everyone who helps us get rid of the coronavirus. For example, wearing a surgical or face mask, it prevents us from transferring any kind of sickness, maybe even coronavirus itself. Wearing a face shield, face shields are not really used that much, but if you are in a crowded place, do not forget to wear it to prevent transferring any sickness and again possibly even coronavirus. Social distancing, always be aware of your surroundings, you don't know if someone near you has the virus, so do not forget to be at least 3 feet away from each other. Proper hygiene, after a long day at work or after going home from buying groceries or doing anything necessary, make sure to always take a shower and wash your clothes properly to get rid of germs and bacterias. So in conclusion, a face mask saves a life when you use it properly. Help our frontline workers prevent the rapid spread of the coronavirus or COVID-19. Don't forget that they also have a family of their own to take care and go home to. So wear a mask, and save lives.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I am not sure if it is enough</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God created the world with love and devotion. As stated in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting eternal life.” God love is so strong for his saints that he made sacrifices for us be a part of this world that he created. Christians should love the environment and its preservation and anyone who doesn’t the love of the father is not in him. As God created plants, and animals he also created humans to take care of the environment that he love so dearly. The action that God want Christians to express is love, compassion, and kindness regarding the environment and its preservation. Throughout this essay I will provide adequate quotes from the Bible and research to convince Christians of the appropriate actions that should be taken regarding the environment and its preservation. God announces his love for the environment several times in the Old Testament. As stated in Deuteronomy 7:13-14 “and he will love and bless you and multiply you he will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land the …show more content…</p><p>In Isaiah 5:8-10 the Lord judges those who misused the land. Tress may be cut down to build houses or to make a fire for heat. Everything that God created is resourceful and it’s for a purpose however, we should limit ourselves to what God provided in order to protect the environment. Most worldviews and religions have made the environment not a big enough issue and do not get involved. Not taking over the environment is a way of letting the enemy win and get what he came to destroy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kau na bahala magpili kung hanngang saan yung kaya nyong sagutan</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus verses off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. Is that really more conducive to a person’s education and learning?<br /><br /><br />“According to results of a new national research study, 78% of more than 1,000 students surveyed still believe it is easier to learn in a classroom”. USA today, (2016) Students are able to physically see the work and are able to use tactile stimulation for their learning needs. Face to face students are able to find out the type of learner they are. In discovering their learning style students can use their knowledge to guide them in their educational experience and needs.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
