There are three main tenses in English – <strong>past</strong>, <strong>present </strong>and <strong>future </strong>– which each have different forms. The <strong>past tense</strong>, for example, can be regular (I played) or irregular (I wrote). The <strong>present tense </strong>can also be regular (I play) or irregular (I write). The <strong>future tense </strong>is always regular (I will play). Each of these tenses has a different function and is used in different situations.</p><p>The <strong>past tense </strong>is used to describe events that have already happened. It is often used with adverbs such as 'yesterday' or 'last week'. The <strong>present tense </strong>is used to describe events that are happening now or in the future.
