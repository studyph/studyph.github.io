Environmental Protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments. ______2. We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. ______3. The main function of ecosystem conservation is protecting or restoring the structure, function and species compilation within the system. This can get hard quickly because everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. ______4. Mangroves are essential to maintaining water quality. With their dense network of roots and surrounding vegetation, they filter and trap sediments, heavy metals, and other pollutants. ______5. Coral reefs does protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. ______6. The ecosystem is an environment where both living and non-living things exist and interact with one another Examples of ecosystem are the tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and mangrove swamps.______7. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many animals. They are the breeding ground of marine life. They are composed of living components only such as water and sand and living components such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, cnidarians, sponges and echinoderms. ______8. Mangrove Swamps is an important system that allows for the breeding of fishes and survival of other marine animals.______9.
