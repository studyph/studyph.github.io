                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Historical data is obtained through the method of evaluation from historical data, and is of two kinds: external and internal. External critique is about ensuring the validity or legitimacy of the results. Often known as lower criticism. Historians use references at any stage.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What is the importance of internal and external criticism in historical research?</p><p>✓✓In evaluating primary source both internal and external cristicisms are important.

2. In the context of Marcos as a war hero, why it is important to perform external and internal criticisms on historical sources?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>.</strong>Without specific information about the claim in question, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question. However, in general, people may continue to believe a claim even if it has been debunked or proven false due to a variety of factors. These factors may include personal beliefs or biases, emotional attachment to the claim, lack of exposure to information that contradicts the claim, or misinformation campaigns that intentionally spread false information. Additionally, people may rely on anecdotal evidence or personal experiences rather than empirical evidence when forming beliefs, which can contribute to the persistence of false claims.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>It is important to perform external and internal criticisms on historical sources in the context of Marcos as a war hero because it allows us to assess the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in those sources. External criticism involves evaluating the credibility of the source itself, such as considering the author's credentials, potential biases, and the historical context in which the source was produced. Internal criticism involves evaluating the content of the source itself, such as assessing its consistency with other historical sources and examining any inconsistencies or contradictions within the source. By performing these types of criticisms, we can better understand the context in which historical claims are made and make more accurate assessments of their veracity. In the case of Marcos as a war hero, external and internal criticisms can help to separate fact from fiction and prevent the spread of myths and misinformation about his wartime experiences.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Historical research also has practical implications. It helps us understand what human beings are like and what mistakes we tend to make. This can help us understand our present situation.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong>To a large degree, it is not vitally important that historians research the past, and particularly not some parts of the past.  The practical point of historical research is to help us understand the choices we have as we face our own problems today.  Much historical research is not particularly useful in that regard.  However, we can argue that researching the past is important (to some extent) in two ways.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Historical research is important simply because we people want to know things.  Human beings are endlessly curious and historical research helps us “scratch that itch.”  For example, there can be no real importance in knowing exactly where the city of Troy was, but people just want to know.  Things that have practical applications are not the only important things in our lives.  History is important in part simply because humans want to know things.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Historical research also has practical implications.  It helps us understand what human beings are like and what mistakes we tend to make.  This can help us understand our present situation.  For example, let us say that historical research tells us that environmental problems caused the fall of various ancient civilizations.  That might imply that we need to be more careful about what we do to our own environment.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Thus, historical research is at least somewhat important both for practical reasons and for reasons that do not have practical applications.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1    The Problem Can Be Stated Clearly and Concisely</p><p></p><p>Unless the problem can be stated clearly and concisely it is probably a poor problem or a non-problem. The best way to test the problem statement is to write it into a concise sentence or paragraph and to share it with others. If the problem cannot be stated in a clear paragraph it has difficulties and will not endure as a suitable problem. Of course, it is not easy to express complex issues in simplistic terms and it may take many weeks and countless drafts before the statement is satisfactory. Good critics are essential. If your spouse or mother cannot understand it, it is probably flaky.</p><p></p><p>2    The Problem Generates Research Questions</p><p></p><p>The problem should generate a number of more specific research questions. These turn the problem into a question format and represent various aspects or components of the problem. The research questions make the more general statement easier to address and provide a framework for the research. Formulating these questions can be a challenge, particularly specifying them at the right level of abstraction.</p><p></p><p>3    It Is Grounded in Theory</p><p></p><p>Good problems have theoretical and/or conceptual frameworks for their analysis. They relate the specifics of what is being investigated to a more general background of theory which helps interpret the results and link it to the field.</p><p></p><p>4    It Relates to One or More Academic Fields of Study</p><p></p><p>Good problems relate to academic fields which have adherents and boundaries. They typically have journals to which adherents relate. Research problems which do not have clear links to one or two such fields of study are generally in trouble. Without such a field it becomes impossible to determine where, in the universe of knowledge, the problem lies.</p><p></p><p>5    It Has a Base in the Research Literature</p><p></p><p>Related to the former points, a well-stated problem will relate to a research literature. Tight problems often relate to a well-defined body of literature, written by a select group of researchers and published in a small number of journals. With some problems, it might at first be difficult to establish the connections and literature base, but there should be a base somewhere.</p><p></p><p>6    It Has Potential Significance/importance</p><p></p><p>This is the important ‘so what’ question: Who cares once you solve the problem? Assume that you have solved the problem and answered the questions and then ask yourself if you are any further ahead. At the very least, the problem must have importance to the researcher, but ideally it should also be of consequence to others.</p><p></p><p>7    It Is DoableWithin the Time Frame, Budget</p><p></p><p>There are logistic factors in terms of your ability actually to carry out the research. There is no point pursuing a problem which is not feasible to research. Do not do a study of education in India unless you have the means to go there and collect data ̶ which may require years to collect. This factor helps explain why few theses relate to longitudinal data. The only exceptions come from research shops where there is a long history of collecting and studying data on a defined population. Terman’s study of genius (1954) in which a defined sample was traced over 30 years, is a good example.</p><p></p><p>8    Sufficient Data Are Available or Can Be Obtained</p><p></p><p>In some cases, there are insufficient data to address the problem. Historical persons may have died, archival materials may be lost, or there may be restrictions on access to certain environments. As noted, it is difficult to conduct research on a distant country unless you can go there and collect local data. One under-used approach is to use an existing database. Some data banks have been developed over many years and contain many opportunities for exploration of new questions and issues.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Step by step guide </p><p>Hope can help you </p><p></p><p></p><br />
