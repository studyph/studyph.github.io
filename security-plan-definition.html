Taking Care of the Environment in Raising Animals It is important to take care of the environment when raising animals.  Some laws regulate the use of a place for animal raising.  Laws prohibit the use of residential areas for large-scale animal raising.  There is a need to segregate waste.  A definite place should be allotted for dumping the waste. Be sure that this waste does not pollute the surrounding area specially lakes, ponds, and rivers.  Animals should stay in their own fence and they are not allowed to loiter. Answer the following questions: 1. What are the materials needed to start an animal raising project? 2. What are the feasibility studies of the above mention on how to start an animal or fish raising? 3. How do you take care the environment in raising animals?​</a>

                                            Directions: Among the texts below, identify the persuasive paragraphs. Write A if it is a persuasive text, or B if it is not. 1. Family is defined as the basic unit of society, and is basically composed of parent/parents and child children related either by ties of marriage, blood, or affinity. It is said to be the one of the most important and valuable gifts of our life. The members of the family can usually count on each other, and make each other feel loved and secured. 2. The best vacation is a trip to the beach. There is a lot to do at the beach. You can go swimming, build a sandcastle, do a lot of games and maybe even do surfing! The beach is very relaxing. Many people enjoy listening to the sound of the ocean waves. When you plan for your next vacation, the beach is your best choice. 3. Students should not be driven to school. Students should walk, cycle or use public transport when possible. It would improve health and well-being, ease traffic on our roads and reduce pollution. Doing so usually give students their daily active minutes to boost their self-esteem, mood and energy levels. 4. There are three most important things which I realized during the pandemic. First, health and well-being are definitely irreplaceable wealth. Then, we only live once, so we should spend enough quality time with our loved ones while we're alive. Finally, good habits and enough preparation pay well. 5. Going out in the burning sun without sensible protection is extremely dangerous. The first reason is that you get awfully sunburnt. The second reason is that you can get horrible skin cancers because of damaging light rays. Another reason is that, too much time out in bright sunlight can badly hurt your eyes. Remember to wear a hat, put on a shirt, use sunscreen and wear sunglasses.​</a>

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.
Source:https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/The-Philippines-Anti-Terrorism-Act-of-2020- Five-things-to-know
   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way.

                            5. Directions: Among the texts below, identify the persuasive paragraphs. Write A if it is a persuasive text, or B if it is not. 1. Family is defined as the basic unit of society, and is basically composed of parent/parents and child children related either by ties of marriage, blood, or affinity. It is said to be the one of the most important and valuable gifts of our life. The members of the family can usually count on each other, and make each other feel loved and secured. 2. The best vacation is a trip to the beach. There is a lot to do at the beach. You can go swimming, build a sandcastle, do a lot of games and maybe even do surfing! The beach is very relaxing. Many people enjoy listening to the sound of the ocean waves. When you plan for your next vacation, the beach is your best choice. 3. Students should not be driven to school. Students should walk, cycle or use public transport when possible. It would improve health and well-being, ease traffic on our roads and reduce pollution. Doing so usually give students their daily active minutes to boost their self-esteem, mood and energy levels. 4. There are three most important things which I realized during the pandemic. First, health and well-being are definitely irreplaceable wealth. Then, we only live once, so we should spend enough quality time with our loved ones while we're alive. Finally, good habits and enough preparation pay well. 5. Going out in the burning sun without sensible protection is extremely dangerous. The first reason is that you get awfully sunburnt. The second reason is that you can get horrible skin cancers because of damaging light rays. Another reason is that, too much time out in bright sunlight can badly hurt your eyes. Remember to wear a hat, put on a shirt, use sunscreen and wear sunglasses.​</h2><br />

                            9. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way.
