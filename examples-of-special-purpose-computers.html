                                            Before proceeding to the quiz, read the following example of a classification paragraph: There are a lot of terms used to describe computers. Most of these words imply the size, expected use or capability of the computer. While the term “computer” can apply to virtually any device that has a microprocessor in it, most people think of a computer as a device that receives input from the user through a mouse or keyboard, processes it in some fashion and displays the result on a screen. Computers can be divided into five according to the purpose they are used for and their capabilities. The most familiar type of microprocessor is the personal computer (PC). It designed for general use by a single person. While a Mac is also a PC, most people relate the term with systems that run the Windows operating system. PCs were first known as microcomputers because they were a complete computer but built on a smaller scale than the huge systems in use by most businesses. A PC can come in two types (three if we include the Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that differ from PCs not by the working policy but in appearance as well.): Desktop and laptop. The former is not designed for portability. The expectation with desktop systems is that you will set the computer up in a permanent location. Most desktops offer more power, storage and versatility for less cost than their portable brethren. On the other hand, the laptops - also called notebooks - are portable computers that integrate the display, keyboard, a pointing device or trackball, processor, memory and hard drive all in a battery-operated package slightly larger than an average hardcover book. Another purpose for using a microprocessor is as a workstation. The computers used for this purpose have a more powerful processor, additional memory and enhanced capabilities for performing a special group of task, such as 3D Graphics or game development. A computer can also be used as a server. For this, it needs to be optimized to provide services to other computers over a ne</a>

The following are some special-purpose systems according to specific applications. They use:<br /></p>Real-time embedded systems Multimedia systemsMultimedia systemsHandheld and portable systems<p><br />These are explained as following below.</p><strong>Real-time embedded systems Multimedia systems: <br /></strong>Embedded systems are small computers having a limited set of hardware like a small processor capable of processing a limited set of instructions (often called as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) a small memory (RAM or EPROM) and I/O devices. These systems usually do specific tasks. <br />Examples are microwave ovens, robots in a manufacturing unit, latest automotive engines, etc. <br />A variety of embedded systems exists of which some are computers with standard operating systems, some have dedicated programs embedded in their limited memories and often some don’t even have any software, hardware (ASIC) to do processing. Nearly all embedded systems use real-time operating system because they are used as control devices and have rigid time requirements. Sensors are used to input data such as temperature, air pressure, etc, from the environment to embedded system where that data is analyzed and several other controls are adjusted by embedded system itself to control the situation of system. <br />A few examples are home appliance controllers, weapon controllers, boiler temperature controllers, fuel injection systems in automobile engines, etc. A real-time system needs that processing to be done in fixed time constraints.<strong>Multimedia systems: <br /></strong>Multimedia refers to data of multiple types that includes audio and video including conventional data like text files, word-processing documents, spreadsheets, etc. It requires that audio and video data must be processed based upon certain time restrictions. This is called streaming. It is usually 30 frames per second for a video file. <br />Applications such as video conferencing, movies and clips downloaded over the internet, mp3, DVD, VCD playing, and recording are examples of various multimedia applications. A multimedia application is usually a combination of both audio and video. Multimedia is not limited to desktop operating systems or computers but it is also becoming popular in handheld.<strong>Handheld and portable systems: <br /></strong>Hand-held systems refers to small portable devices that can be carried along and are capable of performing normal operations. They are usually battery-powered. Examples include Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, palm-top computers, pocket PCs etc. As they are handheld devices, their weights and sizes have certain limitations as a result they are equipped with small memories, slow processors and small display screens, etc. <br />The physical memory capacity is very less (512 KB to 128 MB) hence the operating systems of these devices must manage the memory efficiently. As the processors are slower due to battery problems, the operating system should not burden.<br /><br /><strong>Hope this helps :)</strong><br />

</p><p>Video is a fantastic tool to hook your audience. Unlike a long-winded paragraph, it is extremely easy to consume. We’re all guilty of passively scrolling through our social media feeds and only the most compelling content tends to make the grade for our attention. Video allows you to be concise and capture viewers’ interest in the first few seconds. Social media success lies in your ability to condense information down into easily digestible snippets of content that is long enough to maintain viewers’ attention but short enough to leave them wanting more. You should place clear indicators of the videos intention at the beginning before users have the chance to scroll away.</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Before proceeding to the quiz, read the following example of a classification paragraph: There are a lot of terms used to describe computers. Most of these words imply the size, expected use or capability of the computer. While the term “computer” can apply to virtually any device that has a microprocessor in it, most people think of a computer as a device that receives input from the user through a mouse or keyboard, processes it in some fashion and displays the result on a screen. Computers can be divided into five according to the purpose they are used for and their capabilities. The most familiar type of microprocessor is the personal computer (PC). It designed for general use by a single person. While a Mac is also a PC, most people relate the term with systems that run the Windows operating system. PCs were first known as microcomputers because they were a complete computer but built on a smaller scale than the huge systems in use by most businesses. A PC can come in two types (three if we include the Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that differ from PCs not by the working policy but in appearance as well.): Desktop and laptop. The former is not designed for portability. The expectation with desktop systems is that you will set the computer up in a permanent location. Most desktops offer more power, storage and versatility for less cost than their portable brethren. On the other hand, the laptops - also called notebooks - are portable computers that integrate the display, keyboard, a pointing device or trackball, processor, memory and hard drive all in a battery-operated package slightly larger than an average hardcover book. Another purpose for using a microprocessor is as a workstation. The computers used for this purpose have a more powerful processor, additional memory and enhanced capabilities for performing a special group of task, such as 3D Graphics or game development. A computer can also be used as a server. For this, it needs to be optimized to provide services to other computers over a ne</h2><br />

A server computer is usually designed to be more reliable, secure and scalable than a regular PC. Servers can be used for a variety of tasks, such as hosting websites, email, databases, file sharing and more. Supercomputers are the most powerful computers available and are used for tasks that require massive amounts of processing power, such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and data analysis. They are built with specialized hardware and software that allow them to process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. In summary, computers can be classified into five types based on their purpose and capabilities: personal computers, workstations, servers, laptops, and supercomputers. Understanding these classifications can help individuals choose the appropriate type of computer for their needs.</p><br />
