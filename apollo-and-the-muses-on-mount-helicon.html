                                            GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5. Why do they sometimes go to Mount Olympus?​</a>

                                            The Most BeautifulOf the gods of ancient Greece. Apollo was the most beautiful.His hair was brilliant gold; his eyes were stormy blue. He wore aflowing lunic of golden panther skin, carried a quiver of goldenarrows, and used a golden bow. His chariot was beaten gold; hishorse was white with a platinum man and flame-colored eyes.Apollo was always the god of the sun, but later he became patronof music, poetry, mathematics, and medicine. As an adult, Apollowas known for his unparalled wisdom, but in his youth he wasknown for his barbarous exploits. Several times he was almostexpelled from the company of the gods by Zeus whom he angeredwith his youthful folly.One objectionable folly was Apollo's treatment of a satyrnamed Marsyas. Marsyas was an excellent musician; Apolloconsidered this his talent and would allow no rivalry. HearingMarsyas praised continually. Apollo invited him to a musicalcontest. The winner was to choose a penalty to which the loserwould have to submit, and the Muses were their judges. Marsyasplayed his melodious flute, and Apollo played his lyre. Theyplayed so exquisitely that the Muses could not choose betweenthem, so Apollo suggested that they play their instruments upsidedown and using simultaneously. Apollo turned his lyre upsidedown. played, and chanted a beautiful poem. Because Marsyascould not play his flute upside down and sing at the same time,the despondent satyr was declared the loser. Consequently, Apollocollected the prize.Answer the following based on the myth THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 1.What is the story all about? 2.What was the reason Apollo challenged Marsyas to a contest? 3.Describe what happened at the contest? 4.what was Apollo god of? 5.How would you describe Apollo?  6.Who won the contest? 7.How did Apollo trick Marsyas? 8.Who is the most beautiful? 9.Apollo suggested that they play their instruments upside down and sing simultaneously mean? 10.What lessons could be learned from the myth? ​</a>

                            2. GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5.

                            3. The Most BeautifulOf the gods of ancient Greece. Apollo was the most beautiful.His hair was brilliant gold; his eyes were stormy blue. He wore aflowing lunic of golden panther skin, carried a quiver of goldenarrows, and used a golden bow. His chariot was beaten gold; hishorse was white with a platinum man and flame-colored eyes.Apollo was always the god of the sun, but later he became patronof music, poetry, mathematics, and medicine. As an adult, Apollowas known for his unparalled wisdom, but in his youth he wasknown for his barbarous exploits. Several times he was almostexpelled from the company of the gods by Zeus whom he angeredwith his youthful folly.One objectionable folly was Apollo's treatment of a satyrnamed Marsyas. Marsyas was an excellent musician; Apolloconsidered this his talent and would allow no rivalry. HearingMarsyas praised continually. Apollo invited him to a musicalcontest. The winner was to choose a penalty to which the loserwould have to submit, and the Muses were their judges. Marsyasplayed his melodious flute, and Apollo played his lyre. Theyplayed so exquisitely that the Muses could not choose betweenthem, so Apollo suggested that they play their instruments upsidedown and using simultaneously. Apollo turned his lyre upsidedown. played, and chanted a beautiful poem. Because Marsyascould not play his flute upside down and sing at the same time,the despondent satyr was declared the loser. Consequently, Apollocollected the prize.Answer the following based on the myth THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 1.What is the story all about? 2.What was the reason Apollo challenged Marsyas to a contest? 3.Describe what happened at the contest? 4.what was Apollo god of? 5.How would you describe Apollo?  6.Who won the contest? 7.How did Apollo trick Marsyas? 8.Who is the most beautiful? 9.Apollo suggested that they play their instruments upside down and sing simultaneously mean? 10.What lessons could be learned from the myth? ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>This is your Answer with Fact About Apollo and Daphne, and Moral of the Story of Apollo and Daphne, and the Story of apollo and daphne.</strong></p><p><strong>__________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong>Apollo and Daphne  Story</strong></p><p>In Greek Mythology, APOLLO was the God of Light, and it was his job to pull the sun across the sky in his 4-horse chariot every day. He has also been referred to as the God of music, poetry, art, medicine, knowledge, plague, and archery.
</p><p>
</p><p>Apollo was the son of ZEUS (the God of Thunder) and Leto. He had a twin sister, ARTEMIS, who was the Goddess of Hunting.
</p><p>
</p><p>Apollo was also famous for being an oracular god and had two cults in Delphi and Delos. People would come from all over the world to learn from Apollo what their future held. It was believed that, as the God of both medicine and plague, Apollo could heal people as well as cause disease by shooting people with his arrows.
</p><p>
</p><p>Daphne was a Naiad Nymph in Greek Mythology and was the daughter of a river god. She was famous for being incredibly beautiful and for catching the eye of Apollo. However, Daphne was determined to remain unmarried and untouched by a man for the rest of her life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Greek Mythology states that Apollo had been mocking the God of Love, Eros (also known as Cupid). In retaliation, Eros fired two arrows: a gold arrow that struck Apollo and made him fall in love with Daphne, and a lead arrow that made Daphne hate Apollo. Under the spell of the arrow, Apollo continued to follow Daphne, but she continued to reject him. Apollo told Daphne that he would love her forever.
</p><p>
</p><p>Daphne turned to the river god, Peneus, and pleaded for him to free her from Apollo. In response, Peneus use metamorphosis to turn Daphne into a laurel tree. Apollo used his powers of eternal youth and immortality to make Daphne’s laurel leaves evergreen. It’s believed that Daphne has to sacrifice her body and turn it into a tree as this was the only way she could avoid Apollo’s sexual advances.</p><p><strong>__________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong>Further Facts About Apollo and Daphne:
</strong></p>After Daphne had been transformed into a Laurel, Apollo made the plant sacred and vowed to wear it as clothing.
Eros fired the two arrows into Apollo and Daphne because Apollo had been making fun of him. Apollo had recently been victorious and won Python, an earth dragon, and told Eros that his godly talents were useless compared to his own.
Eros fired the arrows from the top of Mount Parnassus.
In the Greek language, the word for ‘Laurel’ is ‘Daphne’.
The Laurel became the symbol of Apollo and the symbol of poetry.
Every 4 years, a Laurel wreath would be given to the winner of the Pythian Games. These Games were held in honor of Apollo.<p><strong>__________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong>Moral of the story of Apollo and Daphne</strong></p><p>Daphne's choice to become a tree shines a light upon the morality of staying true to oneself. It's an Apollo-brand lesson. After all, he's the god of sunshine and truth. Daphne provides morality and choice.</p><p><strong>__________________________________________________________</strong></p><br />
