These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

                            13. (https.courses.lumenleaming.com/suny-hece-social problems)Schools ideally perform many important functions in modern society. These includes socialization, social integrationsocial placement and social - cultural innovation Functionalists view education as an important social institution thatcontributes both manifest and latent functions. Education also involves several latent functions, like by-products of going toschool and receiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a childstarts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free. The establishment of peerrelationships is another latent function of schooling Most of us met many of our friends while we were in school and some ofthose friendships endure the rest of our lives. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are neededto make our schools and the process of education as effective as possibleWHAT'S MOREActivity 2.

Activity 1: Words to Ponder Direction: Look for the definition of the following words and write it on the space provided. DEFINITION WORD Production Concept Product Concept Selling Concept Relationship Marketing Industrial Marketing Social Marketing​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Production Concept. This concept is the oldest of the concepts in business.  It holds that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive.  Managers focusing on this concept concentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution.  They assume that consumers are primarily interested in product availability and low prices.  This orientation makes sense in developing countries, where consumers are more interested in obtaining the product than in its features.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Product Concept. This orientation holds that consumers will favor those products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features.  Managers focusing on this concept concentrate on making superior products and improving them over time. They assume that buyers admire well-made products and can appraise quality and performance.  However, these managers are sometimes caught up in a love affair with their product and do not realize what the market needs.  Management might commit the “better-mousetrap” fallacy, believing that a better mousetrap will lead people to beat a path to its door. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Selling Concept. This is another common business orientation. It holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy enough of the selling company’s products.  The organization must, therefore, undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort.  This concept assumes that consumers typically sho9w buyi8ng inertia or resistance and must be coaxed into buying.  It also assumes that the company has a whole battery of effective selling and promotional tools to stimulate more buying. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity.  Their aim is to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Marketing Concept.  This is a business philosophy that challenges the above three business orientations.  Its central tenets crystallized in the 1950s.  It holds that the key to achieving its organizational goals (goals of the selling company) consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating customer value to its selected target customers. The marketing concept rests on four pillars:  target market, customer needs, integrated marketing and profitability.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Societal Marketing Concept. This concept holds that the organization’s task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of target markets and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors (this is the original Marketing Concept).  Additionally, it holds that this all must be done in a way that preserves or enhances the consumer’s and the society’s well-being.</p><br />
