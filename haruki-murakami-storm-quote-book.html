                            1. Explain in 50-100 words the following quote by Haruki Murakami:
"When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what the storm is all about."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>It's all about the shift in failure. As you emerge from your life's struggles, you may not be the same being. You will change. Your views and perceptions on success, people, surroundings, relationships, etc., will take a real turn.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>I believe the full quote is:</strong></p><p><strong>"Death is not the opposite of life but an innate part of it. By living our lives, we nurture death."</strong></p><p>Simply put, because every life comes with inevitable and inescapable death, no one can attain immortality and live forever. All living sentient beings on this earth have a limited and finite life span. Death is natural, part of every living beings' life cycle; and therefore, is common to us all. </p><p>Hence, we should not be afraid of, or fear death. Rather, we should take on death as an integral part - stage - of our natural human life. We know that every living thing must come to face death at some point; therefore, why not just come to recognize it, acknowledge it, and be at peace with our future death? </p><p>Death is an inherent part of being human. Death is part of every life cycle. From the time we are born up until the time we die, we all know that we will eventually face death head-on. So embrace death while we're still alive, because it is part of us and part of who we are as humans.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. book 1? storm surge​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A storm surge, storm flood, tidal surge, or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low-pressure weather systems, such as cyclones. It is measured as the rise in water level above the normal tidal level, and does not include waves.</p><p></p><p>The main meteorological factor contributing to a storm surge is high-speed wind pushing water towards the coast over a long fetch.[1] Other factors affecting storm surge severity include the shallowness and orientation of the water body in the storm path, the timing of tides, and the atmospheric pressure drop due to the storm.</p><p></p><p>Most casualties during tropical cyclones occur as the result of storm surges and surges are a major source of damage to infrastructure and property during storms.[2] As extreme weather becomes more intense and sea level rises due to climate change, storm surge is expected to cause more risk to coastal populations.[3] Communities and governments can adapt by building hard infrastructure, like surge barriers, soft infrastructure, like dunes or mangroves , improving coastal construction practices and building social strategies such as early warning, education and evacuation plans.</p><br />

                            15. On prejudice write about an experience related to this quote "Don't judge a book by it's cover</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Imagine a person who has always lived in a small town where everyone knows each other. This person has grown up with certain beliefs and stereotypes about people who live in big cities. They believe that people from big cities are rude, selfish, and always in a rush.</p><p></p><p>One day, this person decides to take a trip to a big city for the first time. As they walk around, they notice how crowded and fast-paced everything is. They feel overwhelmed and intimidated by the people rushing by.</p><p></p><p>However, as they continue to explore the city, they begin to interact with some of the locals. They are surprised to find that many of them are friendly, helpful, and kind. They also realize that they had been wrong to make assumptions about people based on where they live.</p><p></p><p>This experience teaches them the lesson that they should not judge people based on their appearance, background, or location. Just like how one should not judge a book by its cover, they learned to get to know people for who they are, rather than making assumptions based on stereotypes or preconceived notions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the quote "Don't judge a book by its cover" is a powerful reminder to approach people with an open mind and heart, and not to let our prejudices and biases cloud our judgment. It is only by getting to know people on a deeper level that we can truly understand and appreciate their unique qualities and experiences.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning to dance in the rain signifies: when facing difficulties, you must not merely wait for the storm to pass, but 'learn to dance in the rain.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There has been a lot of buzz recently about Haruki Murakami all due to, I'm sure, the fact that his new novel, 1Q84, is about to be released in the US in a week or two. The fresh work, which is already a best-seller in Japan, has been lauded by critics and hyped to death, yet I can't help but be piqued by a book deriving it's title from the seminal work of George Orwell. The Q in the title represents a question, an unknown link in time, as the protagonist finds herself suddenly transported to a sort of parallel universe. This is a theme Murakami is fond of, as is in evidence in his, so far, penultimate novel, Kafka on the Shore.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The Worm is planning to destroy Tokyo with a massive earthquake, and Frog needs Katagiri's help to stop it.</p><p></p><p>Frog chose Katagiri because he senses that Katagiri is a kind and honest person who is willing to help others. Frog believes that Katagiri has the courage and determination to help him defeat the Worm and save Tokyo. Additionally, Frog reveals to Katagiri that he is the spirit of a small park in Tokyo that was destroyed during a redevelopment project, and he feels a connection with Katagiri because Katagiri also lost his job due to a similar project.

                         The message of the story, The Wind Cave by Haruki Murakami<p>
</p>"There are <strong>three types</strong> of <strong>emotional wounds: those that easily heal, those that take a long time to heal, and those that remain with you until you die.</strong> I think one of the big ones in writing is to investigate the residual wounds as profoundly and in as much detail as possible.
<p></p>I thought her body needed to be laid in a much more <strong>comfortable</strong> <strong>position to rest</strong>. In, for example, the  <strong>middle of a meadow</strong>. We would go to see her without a word, pushing our way through the lush green
grass as we walked. The wind would rustle the grass gradually, and birds and insects would call out all  around her. <strong>Wildflowers</strong> 'raw odor will fill the air, <strong>dripping</strong> with <strong>pollen</strong>.
<p>
</p>Why did you interpret the ending?  <p>
</p>It's a little difficult to tell, but the short story is about the main character coping with his sister's death,  <strong>Komi</strong>. Thinking about his sister in the coffin, he develops <strong>claustrophobia</strong> and it's like he feels her life and  everything about her has been reduced to being in that coffin.By reminding him at the end that Alice  remains in Wonderland, it seems like he has come to know that what his sister felt and did will still stay in
this world through his memories, and there might be some comfort in that.  It's a little difficult to tell, but the short story is about the main <strong>character</strong> coping with his sister's death,  Komi. <p></p>Thinking about his sister in the <strong>coffin</strong>, he develops <strong>claustrophobia</strong> and it's like he feels her life and  everything about her has been reduced to being in that coffin.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When I found out I had to move schools in 5th grade, I was extremely nervous because I had never been to a new school before. The first day, I could feel everyone's eyes on me as I walked in. Everything seem to be in a foreign language and the students did not look particularly friendly. I was extremely intimidated, wondering what I had gotten myself into.</p><p></p><p>The following day, I was walking through the hallway, desperately trying to find my classroom, when I heard a voice call out my name. I turned around to see a rather plain looking girl, with glasses and braces, wearing a shirt two sizes too big. Her hair was pulled back in a severe ponytail and she had no makeup on whatsoever. I was hesitant to even talk to her, thinking she must be some kind of nerd and I would only embarrass myself if I hung out with her. I reluctantly said hello, and she introduced herself as Sarah.</p><p></p><p>To my surprise, Sarah turned out to be the funniest and wittiest person I had ever met! She was kind and generous, never afraid to speak her mind, and always had the best advice to give. Even better, people would flock to her when she had something witty to say and she never seemed to have an issue fitting in. Sarah was my first friend at this new school and soon, I learned to never judge a book by its cover. I'm glad I gave Sarah a chance, or else I would have missed out on a great friendship.</p><br />

                            28. On prejudice write about an experience related to this quote "Don't judge a book by it's cover</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prejudice is an unfortunate part of human nature, and it often leads us to judge others based on their appearance, race, or gender. However, the truth is that appearances can be deceiving, and we should never judge a book by its cover.</p><p></p><p>I had a personal experience that taught me this lesson when I was in college. I had just started my first semester and was looking forward to making new friends. One day, I saw a girl walking across the campus, and I immediately formed an opinion about her based on her appearance. She had tattoos and piercings, and her hair was dyed bright pink. I assumed she was a rebellious troublemaker, and I didn't think she would be someone I would want to be friends with.</p><p></p><p>However, a few days later, I found myself sitting next to her in class. We started talking, and I soon realized that she was one of the kindest and most intelligent people I had ever met. She was studying to be a nurse, and she had a passion for helping others. She was also incredibly artistic and had a talent for drawing and painting. We quickly became friends, and I learned a valuable lesson about not judging people based on their appearance.</p><p></p><p>This experience taught me that we should never judge others based on their appearance or other superficial qualities. We never know what kind of person someone is until we take the time to get to know them. By judging people based on their appearance, we risk missing out on valuable friendships and connections. We should always strive to be open-minded and accepting of others, regardless of their appearance or background. After all, the most interesting and wonderful people often come in unexpected packages.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
