O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name, 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art myself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand or foot,
Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name
Belonging to a man.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owed
Without the title. Romeo doff thy name,
And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.</a>

This modality has three types, namely: Modular Distance Learning OnlineDistance Learning, and Television/Ràdio-Based Instruction. This is most viablefor independent leamers, andlearners supported by periodic supervision of parents or guardians.

                            5. Please explain what Juliet is trying to say here:
O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name, 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art myself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand or foot,
Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name
Belonging to a man.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owed
Without the title. Romeo doff thy name,
And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In this passage from William Shakespeare's play, "Romeo and Juliet," Juliet is expressing her love for Romeo and lamenting the fact that their families are enemies, and their names are the only barrier between them. She is asking Romeo to deny his family name, or if he cannot do that, to swear his love to her and she will no longer consider herself a Capulet.</p><p></p><p>Juliet then goes on to explain that it is not Romeo's true self that she considers an enemy, but rather his name, which represents his family and their feud with hers. She argues that a name is just a word and has no real bearing on a person's true nature, using the example of a rose, which would still be sweet even if it were called by another name.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Juliet urges Romeo to give up his name and take her instead, emphasizing that his name is not a part of who he truly is and should not stand in the way of their love.</p><br />
