Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

A Red, Red Rose
Robert Burns
O my Luve is like a rod, red rose
That's newly sprung in June;
O my Luve is like the melody
That's sweetly played in tune.
So fair art thou, my bonnic lass,
So deep in luve am 1;
And I will love thee still, my dear,
Till a' the scas gang dry.
Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
I will love thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall ran.
And fare thee weel, my only luve!
And fare thee weel awhile!
And I will come again, my luve,
Though it were ten thousand miles.

Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</a>

Covid-19 has put different adjustments in many aspects worldwide. However, despite the global impact that this pandemic has brought, things must continue even in a way that we never imagined before. That includes the system of education not just here in the Philippines but in other parts of the world. Education must continue, but this time, in a not-so- traditional setup. Addressing all the questions on how classes will take place amidst health and economic crisis, the Department of Education (DepEd) announced the implementation for the first time, of so-called "Blended Learning". This assures that education continues without putting the safety of the teachers and the learners on the line. In doing so, we must be adept with the use of modern technology. The department is also aware of the students' scarcity of resources such as desktops, laptops, and other gadgets. Internet connectivity in the country is also a thing to consider. With these, DepEd started the printing of self- learning modules. These are all unconventional, but with discipline coupled with determination and patience, everything is possible. No pandemic can stop the Filipino youth from learning​</a>

                            4. An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the "SAME SEX MARRIAGE "that is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals. Father Nael: (Priest) It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society) It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

                            7. Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.
Activity 2: My Personal Insights:
After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument
and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.</h2><br />

                            8. 1. Directions: Read the poem carefully. Answer the questions that come after it
A Red, Red Rose
Robert Burns
O my Luve is like a rod, red rose
That's newly sprung in June;
O my Luve is like the melody
That's sweetly played in tune.
So fair art thou, my bonnic lass,
So deep in luve am 1;
And I will love thee still, my dear,
Till a' the scas gang dry.
Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
I will love thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall ran.
And fare thee weel, my only luve!
And fare thee weel awhile!
And I will come again, my luve,
Though it were ten thousand miles.
47. What is the feeling inspired in the first two lines of the poem?
48. What mood or feeling did the author evoke on the reader?
49. What poetic device is used to separate the ideas in the first two stanzas from the last two stanzas of the
poem?
50. In the last stanza, we discover that the lovers are soon to be parted. What effect, if any does you suppose
this impending separation is having on the couple's love? What do you think might be causing the
separation?
51. What did Robert Burns promise in this poem?
52. Is there any evidence that the trip is real? Or does it only take place in his imagination? What is the
speaker's purpose in mentioning the separation?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>47. The first lines compare the speaker's love to “a red, red rose.” “Luve” could refer to the beloved, the person the speaker loves. It could also refer to the speaker's feelings for this person. Saying the beloved is like a rose “newly sprung in June” emphasizes her beauty and youth.</p><p></p><p>48. ''A Red, Red Rose'' by Robert Burns has a mood that evokes longing and love. The speaker is deeply in love with the object of his affections</p><p></p><p>49. The rhyme scheme varies between the first two stanzas and the last two stanzas in the poem. The first two stanzas use a rhyme scheme of abcb, where the first and third lines do not rhyme.</p><p></p><p>50.In the final stanza of the poem, there may be some effects from the impending separation. As per the poet the effect can be that, the love of both needs to wait patiently until the lover's return. Due to time and distance their love can fade away and become blurred.</p><p></p><p>51.  Robert Burns promises his eternal love to his "bonnie lass" and that no matter how far he might go, he will always return to her side.</p><p></p><p>52. The separation here is not a literal trip.  Instead, Burns is using the traditional idea of separation from a love to underscore the tenderness and purity of the speaker's feelings for his beloved.  </p><p></p><p>He describes it as the freshest of roses "newly sprung in June", and a "melodie sweetly...</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Nawa'y makatulong .

                            12. LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEET 2.5 Boarding House Analogy Directions: Imagine you are the landlord of a very strange boarding house. Your job is to fill the rooms in the building in the most efficient way possible. The rules you have to follow are as strange as the building because quantum mechanics is not like anything you might have expected. State what electron rule is being applied in the situations stated on the left side of the table. Explain each rule. (This activity is adapted from birdvilleschoosi.net). Boarding House Rules Electron Rules From the Bottom Up: Rooms should be filled from the ground floor and up. Fill up first the rooms on the first floor before starting to put new tenants on the second floor. Singles First, the owner of the building wants to have the renters spread out as much as possible. For that reason, singles are placed first in rooms before couples. If couples must be placed into a room then all of the other rooms on that floor must already have a single in them, Opposite Gender Only: When two people are to be situated in a room, they must be of opposite genders. No men may stay together, and no women may room together. This is an arbitrary rule on the part of the owners: in a just world, we wouldn't have to follow it, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with society's norm.​</h2><br />

Covid-19 has put different adjustments in many aspects worldwide. However, despite the global impact that this pandemic has brought, things must continue even in a way that we never imagined before. That includes the system of education not just here in the Philippines but in other parts of the world. Education must continue, but this time, in a not-so- traditional setup. Addressing all the questions on how classes will take place amidst health and economic crisis, the Department of Education (DepEd) announced the implementation for the first time, of so-called "Blended Learning". This assures that education continues without putting the safety of the teachers and the learners on the line. In doing so, we must be adept with the use of modern technology. The department is also aware of the students' scarcity of resources such as desktops, laptops, and other gadgets. Internet connectivity in the country is also a thing to consider. With these, DepEd started the printing of self- learning modules. These are all unconventional, but with discipline coupled with determination and patience, everything is possible.
