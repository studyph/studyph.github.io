To Those Who Have Lost Everything (Francisco Mexico)
Crossed in despair, many deserts full of hope. Carrying their empty
fists of sorrow everywhere. Mouthing a bitter night of shovels and nails.
&quot;You&#039;re nothing, you&#039;re trash, your home&#039;s nowhere&quot;- Mountains will speak
for you rain will flesh your bones green again among ashes, after a long fire. Started in a fantasy island, some time ago. Turning natives into aliens.</p>

                                            I Am Proud to be A FilipinoToribia A. ManoI am a Filipino. I came from islands rippled with sunWhere days are green fires and nights are warmWith moon and stars. Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.LEARNING TASK 1After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

was discovered in Pleistocene cave deposited of South Africa in 1924 by Dart.
3. Australopithecus has been divided into four species based on the thin teeth, jaw
and brain size. They are Australopithecus aferensis, Australopithecus africanus,
Australopithecus robustus and Australopithecus boisei.
4. Hominization is the evolutionary of human characteristics that differentiate
homonids (organisms belonging in the Homo genus) distinct from their primate
ancestors.
5. Homo Rudolfensis is the first homonid, discovered by anthropologist Richard
Leakey and Meave Leakey in Kenya in 1972
6. Homo Habilis this specie name means "Handy man" because the ability to make
and use tools
7. Homo Erectus this species name means "Upright man with body proportion
similar to that of modern humans.
8. Homo Florensiensis this species nicknamed "Hobbit" due to their small stature
with a height of more or less 3 feet and lived 95,000 to 17,000 years ago in the
islands of Flores, Indonesia
9. Homo Heidelbergensis the first of early human species to live in colder climates,
first to hunt large animals on routine basis using spears and first to
construction human shelter.
10. Homo Sapiens this species name means "wise man" that appeared from
200,000 years old.
11. Homo Neanderthalensis the first to practice burial of their clead, hunting and
gathering food and sewing clothes from animal skin using bone needles.
12. Homo Sapiens Sapiens this subspecies known as Cro-Magnon characterized to
be anatomically modern humans and lived in the last Ice Age of Europe.
13. Humanization is the long process of improving the humans' everyday living
through innovation, discovery, enhancing routines and creating mechanism
with the intention of harmonizing and harnessing the fullest potentials of their
fellow human beings.
14. Paleolithic Age pertains to the old stone period.
15. Mesolithic Age pertains to the middle stone period.
16. Neolithic Age pertains to the old stone period.
17. Hunting and Food Gathering Society is the earliest forrn of human society.</a>

                                            The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.

Girdling my loins is blood rich as milkFor I was born of sultans, rajahs, kings,Soldiers, heroes who fought to singThe poetry of freedom. My house is my landVirgin, brown, wombed out of loam, volcanic rock and shells,Carpeted with rice, corn, coconut, cane, treesThat rise as temples to grapple windsRains, mighty rivers furrowing the earth.Where I walk, my shadow is a marriage of flagsMalay, Chinese, Spanish, American, JapaneseWhile in my bones sleep quietly as a brideVanquished desires of conquerors who dreamt of empires,Gold, trade and spice. Though a paly breedI stand with the ancients for my love and loyaltyAre as fish to the sea. I am proud of my brownness,My duty and destiny are thirty-million brown menPlanting rice, husking coconut, throwing nets far into the PacificHacking mountains of iron, coal, chrome, manganese and timberTo live. We are one and the same. A moving, restless caravanOf dark brown skins building a holy heritage of democracyPiece by piece with our dreams, sweat and deathAs a bird builds patiently twig by twigThe warm, brown circle of its nest.I am a Filipino. I believe in the goodness and the bounty of God,I believe in the grandeur of charity and peace as a cure for the ills of manFor I am a Christian who looks upon all menAs brothers whose task it is to love.I believe in my country and in the deathlessness of my flagFor its every color is a history of courage, sacrifice, deathAgainst injustice, tyranny, oppression and hate.I believe in my people as noble keepers of the faith:That all men are equal; that all men are free.I believe with verdant and sprawling mountains, hills, valleys, plains,Lakes, waterfalls, rivers, sunsets, beachesAnd a generous sea. Alive, sovereign, wondrously happy in work andAbundant with hope for my people.I am proud to be a Filipino.LEARNING TASK 1After reading the poem, answer the following questions.

with a height of more or less 3 feet and lived 95,000 to 17,000 years ago in the
islands of Flores, Indonesia
9. Homo Heidelbergensis the first of early human species to live in colder climates,
first to hunt large animals on routine basis using spears and first to
construction human shelter.
10. Homo Sapiens this species name means "wise man" that appeared from
200,000 years old.
11. Homo Neanderthalensis the first to practice burial of their clead, hunting and
gathering food and sewing clothes from animal skin using bone needles.
12. Homo Sapiens Sapiens this subspecies known as Cro-Magnon characterized to
be anatomically modern humans and lived in the last Ice Age of Europe.
13. Humanization is the long process of improving the humans' everyday living
through innovation, discovery, enhancing routines and creating mechanism
with the intention of harmonizing and harnessing the fullest potentials of their
fellow human beings.
14. Paleolithic Age pertains to the old stone period.
15. Mesolithic Age pertains to the middle stone period.
16. Neolithic Age pertains to the old stone period.
17. Hunting and Food Gathering Society is the earliest forrn of human society.</h2><br />

                            17. The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.
