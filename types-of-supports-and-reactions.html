One remarkable evidence to support stellar nucleosynthesis and star formation theory is the discovery of and gasses which justifies the stages of stellar formation which are happening across the universe of 6. Throughout history, scientist have been working on a elements as to their properties and to predict new elements. 7. an English chemist arranged the elements in the periodic table by using atomic number as basis. 8. The first 3 minutes of focused primarily on the expansion and cooling of universe so as to the synthesis of the first three elements. 9. The second cosmological event is stellar nucleosynthesis, a process in which heavier elements such as Beryllium and Iron were formed by combining and from the nuclei of a lighter elements. 10. Under the process of heavier elements are created in different types of stars as they die or explode and the abundance of these elements change as the stars evolve.​</a>

Visualize human and environment systems as two distinct and nterconnected approaches along with human action and environmental reaction as elements of the systems. Take into consideration a pyramid of human systems correlated to environmental systems. Create a model of the environmental system and its continually changing aspects. 4. Support a judgment abstract conceptualization of the human systen m with the elements of goal development, strategy formation, selection, and action. 5. Embody and intellectualize various types of environmental consciousness in each element 6. Classify, and model primary and secondary criticism loops with regards to human action.​</a>
