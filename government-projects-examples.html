                                            How a security works An entity such as a company creates securities for sale and is then known as the issuer, those who then buy the securities are known as the investors. Typically, securities represent an investment in which the issuer can use to raise new capital. For example, companies that go public with an IPO usually do so to raise capital for further businesses development. Municipalities such as city, state or county governments may raise funds for projects by floating a municipal bond issue. Raising capital through the sale of securities is often deemed a preferred alternative to traditional financing such as bank loans.In the US, the public offer and sale of securities are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public offerings, sales and trades of securities must be filed and registered with the SEC's state securities department.Explanation Answer?​</a>

Eventually most gas powered cars will be replaced by electric cars. 1 Comprehen sion Questions 1. What kind of cars will be used in gasoline continues to increase its price? 2. If climate change continues to get worse what will the government do in the car industry? 3. What benefit will the electric cars can provide to the people? 4. Do you agree that gasoline cars be replaced with electric cars? Why? Or why not?

                            9. How a security works An entity such as a company creates securities for sale and is then known as the issuer, those who then buy the securities are known as the investors. Typically, securities represent an investment in which the issuer can use to raise new capital. For example, companies that go public with an IPO usually do so to raise capital for further businesses development. Municipalities such as city, state or county governments may raise funds for projects by floating a municipal bond issue. Raising capital through the sale of securities is often deemed a preferred alternative to traditional financing such as bank loans.In the US, the public offer and sale of securities are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public offerings, sales and trades of securities must be filed and registered with the SEC's state securities department.Explanation Answer?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Securities are financial instruments that represent ownership in a company or a debt owed by a company or government entity. They are typically issued and sold by the issuer, who can be a company or government, in order to raise capital for various purposes. Investors can buy securities in order to participate in the ownership or debt of the issuer, with the expectation of receiving a return on their investment through dividends or interest payments.</p><p></p><p>In the United States, the sale and trade of securities is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This agency oversees the public offering and sale of securities in order to protect investors and ensure transparency in the financial markets. Public offerings of securities, as well as sales and trades, must be filed and registered with the SEC's state securities department.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Yes, that is a good explanation of how securities work. To summarize, securities are financial instruments that represent ownership in a company or an investment in a project. They are created by issuers, who sell them to investors in order to raise capital. Securities can be publicly traded on a stock exchange or privately traded between individuals or institutions. In the United States, the sale and trade of securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect investors and ensure fair and transparent markets.</p><br />

Eventually most gas powered cars will be replaced by electric cars. 1 Comprehen sion Questions 1. What kind of cars will be used in gasoline continues to increase its price? 2. If climate change continues to get worse what will the government do in the car industry? 3. What benefit will the electric cars can provide to the people? 4.
