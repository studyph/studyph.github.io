                                            Does evil exist?
The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, “Yes, he did!”
“God created everything? The professor asked.
“Yes sir”, the student replied.
The professor answered, “If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil”. The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.
Another student raised his hand and said, “Can I ask you a question professor?”
“Of course”, replied the professor.
The student stood up and asked, “Professor, does cold exist?”
“What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never
been cold?” The students snickered at the young man’s question.
The young man replied, “In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.”
The student continued, “Professor, does darkness exist?”
The professor responded, “Of course it does.”
The student replied, “Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton’s prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn’t this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.”
Finally the young man asked the professor, “Sir, does evil exist?”
Now uncertain, the professor responded, “Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man’s inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.”
To this the student replied, “Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God’s love present in his heart. It’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.”
The professor sat down.
The young man’s name — Albert Einstein.</a>

                                            Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism. You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43

                                             ,       Aren’t you tired of pretending that you are okay? Honey, it is okay to feel sad, that is part of our life. You always concealed your emotions through smiling. Does pretending can make you feel that you are okay?     And sweetie, aren’t u tired of saying that you are okay? If you wanna cry then let it flow. Cry as hard as you want but make sure that once you stop crying, you’ll also let your heart become well. It is okay not to be okay but wanna know what is not okay? Forcing yourself that you are, even if you are not. And this is an open letter for you.       You are a soldier because you are strong. You are beautiful because you are you. Do not compare yourself to others because you are unique and honey, it is okay to feel sad because you are still alive and that’s life.      Stop pretending that you aren’t hurt, be true to yourself and stop covering what you really feel.      I wrote this because I want you to feel that you are enough and if ever someone let you feel that you aren’t, I just want to say that I am proud of you and you are more than enough.       No matter how hard it is just kept on going in life. If you aren’t okay today, just keep on fighting until you reach the end. You’ll be okay, maybe not now but soon. I have a trust on you and I hope you will make yourself okay.    If crying doesn't make you feel okay. Accept everything that has been done, move forward and see the beauty in life.      To all ladies and men, if ever you read this one. I just want to remind you that if you are in pain or suffering right now. I am with you, God is with you, and you have yourself.       ’  , ..                                               yours truly,                                               the one who                                               experienced                                               pain but now                                               totally healed.​</a>

                            9. Does evil exist?
The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, “Yes, he did!”
“God created everything? The professor asked.
“Yes sir”, the student replied.
The professor answered, “If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil”. The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.
Another student raised his hand and said, “Can I ask you a question professor?”
“Of course”, replied the professor.
The student stood up and asked, “Professor, does cold exist?”
“What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never
been cold?” The students snickered at the young man’s question.
The young man replied, “In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.”
The student continued, “Professor, does darkness exist?”
The professor responded, “Of course it does.”
The student replied, “Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton’s prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn’t this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.”
Finally the young man asked the professor, “Sir, does evil exist?”
Now uncertain, the professor responded, “Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man’s inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.”
To this the student replied, “Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God’s love present in his heart. It’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.”
The professor sat down.
The young man’s name — Albert Einstein.</h2><br />

                            17. Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism. You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43

                            18.  ,       Aren’t you tired of pretending that you are okay? Honey, it is okay to feel sad, that is part of our life. You always concealed your emotions through smiling. Does pretending can make you feel that you are okay?     And sweetie, aren’t u tired of saying that you are okay? If you wanna cry then let it flow. Cry as hard as you want but make sure that once you stop crying, you’ll also let your heart become well. It is okay not to be okay but wanna know what is not okay? Forcing yourself that you are, even if you are not. And this is an open letter for you.       You are a soldier because you are strong. You are beautiful because you are you. Do not compare yourself to others because you are unique and honey, it is okay to feel sad because you are still alive and that’s life.      Stop pretending that you aren’t hurt, be true to yourself and stop covering what you really feel.      I wrote this because I want you to feel that you are enough and if ever someone let you feel that you aren’t, I just want to say that I am proud of you and you are more than enough.       No matter how hard it is just kept on going in life. If you aren’t okay today, just keep on fighting until you reach the end. You’ll be okay, maybe not now but soon. I have a trust on you and I hope you will make yourself okay.    If crying doesn't make you feel okay. Accept everything that has been done, move forward and see the beauty in life.      To all ladies and men, if ever you read this one. I just want to remind you that if you are in pain or suffering right now. I am with you, God is with you, and you have yourself.       ’  , ..                                               yours truly,                                               the one who                                               experienced                                               pain but now                                               totally healed.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>₊ଘ﹕Answer ⸝⸝</strong></p>c.   1. Erra is a good leader in the class. She believes that actions speak louder than words that's why she always succeeds in everything she does.c. It's easy to say things but difficult to act and follow through​."Actions speak louder than words" means that <strong>something you have said can only be totally confirmed if you've personally done/experienced it yourself</strong>. This saying is also similar to "Things are easier said than done."a.    2. My grandmother said to always put your best foot forward every time if you want to have a good future.a. Give your best every time."Always put your best foot forward" means that <strong>we must exert our efforts and choose the best thing to do in every situation</strong> we find ourselves in. The word "foot" is used because we commonly relate the decisions we make in life as "steps".a.    3. Miel is hardworking and has a strong faith in God. She believes that you should do your best and God will do the rest.a. To become successful, you must do your part and trust God."Do you best, and God will do the rest.", I don't think I can add more explanations since this saying is already obvious. But this basically means that <strong>we should work hard in every aspect of our lives, and when it gets rough or when you've reached your limits, you can depend on God to guide you.</strong>b.    4. Ashley is the noisiest in the class. Her classmates termed him an empty vessel that makes much noise because he ranked last in the class.b. People who know nothing are the most talkative"An empty vessel that makes much noise.", <strong>the empty vessel refers to someone that is loud.</strong> Usually, people who have insecurities with their knowledge tend to cover up and distract others from their imperfections by talking a lot.c.    5. Chelsea believes what you sow is what you reap depending on how much effort you exert on certain things.c. What you do is what you get; it depends on how good you or bad your action is."What you sow is what you reap." means that <strong>with every action you do, there is an equal reaction that will result from it</strong>.b.    6. Lara is an Aeta. She has no confidence to show her talent because of her physical appearance. Her teacher Jona reminds her that beauty is in the eye of the beholder so she does not have to worry about what others would say.b. What is beautiful to someone may be different from others."Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.", beauty is subjective. This saying means that <strong>people see things differently</strong>, everyone has different standards and preferences.b.    7. Flynn was a victim of gossips. Because of this, she finally had an anger outburst and whispered to those gossipers, "Curiosity killed the cat."b. It's dangerous meddling in the business of others.a.    8 Jazzy set goals ahead. She always looks at the future and sometimes oversees things that may happen to her when she becomes old. Her father told her to not cross a bridge until she comes to it.a. Just focus on the present situation and not worry too much about the things ahead."Do not cross a bridge until you come to it." means that <strong>we shouldn't let things in the future take up too much space in our minds</strong> that we forget the things happening in front of us in the present. Although planning and setting goals is a good thing to do, being too preoccupied with the future isn't.c.    9. For Rein, time is gold so he finishes his works on timec. Spend your time efficiently.a.   10. Gia is friendly, but she does not trust easily. She chooses her friends very carefully. She always keeps this mind, "Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are."a. Your friends' character may be reflected on you.<p>ʚ —————————————————— ɞ</p><p>     Best of luck, buttercup! ₍^･ω･^₎⟆</p><p>              #BrainliestBunch</p><br />
