                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Managers are responsible for planning, organizing, leading, and controlling resources in order to achieve organizational goals. They develop strategies, set objectives, assign tasks, and direct individuals and teams to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. They also monitor the progress of projects, evaluate results, and provide feedback to those involved.</p><p></p><p>2. Managers differ from non-managerial employees in that they are responsible for supervising and coordinating the work of others. They must be able to motivate and inspire their teams, manage conflict and day-to-day operations, and make decisions that will affect the entire organization. They must also be able to interpret and analyze data, think strategically, and plan for the future.</p><p></p><p>3. Yes, all organizations need managers in order to achieve their goals. Managers help to ensure that the organization is running smoothly and efficiently, and they can provide critical direction and guidance to employees. Without managers, organizations could quickly become disorganized and inefficient.</p><p></p><p>4. It is important to study management because it provides a framework for understanding how organizations work.

Additionally, studying management can help individuals develop the skills needed to become successful managers.</p><p></p><p>5. In today's environment, effectiveness is more important to organizations than efficiency.

Managers and organizations are inseparable; like love and marriage they go together. ... You cannot manage unless you have an organization to manage but you can have an organization that is completely unmanageable and you can completely misunder- stand the organization that you do manage.</p><p></p><p>3. An organization is a group of people who work together, like a neighborhood association, a charity, a union, or a corporation.

It can also refer to a system of arrangement or order, or a structure for classifying thinks.</p><p></p><p>4.Good managers hold themselves to the highest standards so that their employees will have a clear example of what they should strive for.
