You asked your relative if there was an incident of landslide in the past, but your relative said there was none.why do you think that the area is prone to landslide? cite evidences to back up your answer.b. with your knowledge on the landslide prevention,what method can you suggest to your relatives or anyone living in the same area that will best work to prevent the steepy hill slope from landslide?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction
</p><p>This handbook is intended to be a resource for people affected by landslides to
</p><p>acquire further knowledge, especially about the conditions that are unique to their
</p><p>neighborhoods and communities. Considerable literature and research are available
</p><p>concerning landslides, but unfortunately little of it is synthesized and integrated
</p><p>to address the geographically unique geologic and climatic conditions around the
</p><p>globe. Landslides occur throughout the world, under all climatic conditions and
</p><p>terrains, cost billions in monetary losses, and are responsible for thousands of deaths
</p><p>and injuries each year. Often, they cause long-term economic disruption, population
</p><p>displacement, and negative effects on the natural environment.
</p><p>Outdated land-use policies may not always reflect the best planning for use of
</p><p>land that is vulnerable to landslides. The reasons for poor or nonexistent land-use
</p><p>policies that minimize the perceived or actual danger and damage potential from
</p><p>geologic hazards are many and encompass the political, cultural, and financial complexities and intricacies of communities. Landslides often are characterized as local
</p><p>problems, but their effects and costs frequently cross local jurisdictions and may
</p><p>become State or Provincial or national problems.
</p><p>Growing populations may be limited in their geographic expansion, except to
</p><p>occupy unstable, steep, or remote areas. Often, stabilizing landslide-scarred areas
</p><p>is too costly, and some inhabitants have no other places to relocate. Fortunately,
</p><p>simple, “low-tech” precautions and actions can be adopted to at least ensure an
</p><p>individual’s immediate safety, and this handbook gives a brief overview of many of
</p><p>these options. We strongly suggest that, where possible, the assistance of professional engineers/geologists or those experienced in the successful mitigation of
</p><p>unstable slopes be consulted before actions are taken. This handbook helps homeowners, community and emergency managers, and decisionmakers to take the
</p><p>positive step of encouraging awareness of available options and recourse in regard to
</p><p>landslide hazard.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ever since we started our simple living journey a few years ago we’ve slowly been learning new skills and becoming more and more self-sufficient.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We examined the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a junk food tax as an intervention to counter increasing obesity in North America.</p><p></p><p>Small excise taxes are likely to yield substantial revenue but are unlikely to affect obesity rates. High excise taxes are likely to have a direct impact on weight in at-risk populations but are less likely to be politically palatable or sustainable.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of earmarked health programs and subsidies is likely to be a key determinant of tax success in the fight against obesity.</p><p></p><p>In response to rapidly increasing obesity in North America, health researchers and policymakers are considering novel approaches to counter the growth of this epidemic.1 The divergence between energy intake and expenditure has widened since 1970,2 with a steady increase in daily calorie intake leading scientists and researchers to suggest targeting food consumption as a means of addressing the obesity epidemic. One such approach is now gaining momentum while generating heated debates in and outside the scientific community: a tax on unhealthy foods has been proposed to help reduce their consumption. We consider the implications of implementing 2 types of junk food tax (a nutrient tax and a food and beverage category tax) and provide an overview of arguments in favor of and against their institution. Ethical concerns must be considered along with the current state of scientific evidence about obesity and the efficacy of taxes for behavior change. We have identified significant knowledge gaps that provide direction for future research.</p><br />
