If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</a>

                            10. Identify the thesis statement present in the following paragraphs below. If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</h2><br />

Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion.
