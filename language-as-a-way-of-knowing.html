                        <p><strong>Answer: It is important to know the level of formality in a language because the message should be conveyed clearly and accurately without any degree of ambiguity. For example is when we write an academic document, your writing skills are also being tested, which is why you need to maintain that degree of formality throughout your paper. Other example is when you leave for college and you want to move to another country and you will be interviewed first, if you are not formal then there is a slight chance of you not being accepted into that college.

Instead, he put it off. He went skateboarding with his friends at the park, and he played video games with his brother. When his mom suggested he clean his room, Elias happily cleaned. He chose to do anything other than the project. Elias suddenly panicked as he remembered the due date. The project was due tomorrow! He hadn't even started. He was too afraid to tell his mom. She would not be happy about this. Immediately, Elias began scrambling to figure out how he could get the project done on time. At school the next day, Elias turned in his finished product. Elias was not proud of the work he had completed. He believed it would have been much been better if he spent more fime on it. Elias wished that he had been more responsible.</p><br />
