                                            Little Manuel’s teacher reprimanded him for coloring the leaves on the trees yellow and the sky orange.  He didn’t understand why the teacher would get mad at him, he looked at the crayons and looked out of the window. He didn’t see anything wrong so he continued coloring pictures that way.  Again and again, his teacher kept on telling him that what he was doing was wrong. So, he started to shy away from his classmates because of embarrassment. Manuel’s teacher became concerned. She called the boy’s parents to school. After consulting with Manuel’s parents, she found out that he was colorblind.  The teacher apologized to Manuel’s parents.

He didn’t see anything wrong so he continued coloring pictures that way. Again and again, his teacher kept on telling him that what he was doing was wrong. So, he started to shy away from his classmates because of embarrassment. Manuel’s teacher became concerned. She called the boy’s parents to school. After consulting with Manuel’s parents, she found out that he was colorblind. The teacher apologized to Manuel’s parents.

1. A car that starts from rest suddenly accelerates with a constant value of 3.75m/s 2 within 15 seconds, what is the final velocity of the car?
(Use the formula: v f = v i + a t)
2. A coin was dropped on top of a building, neglecting air friction, it reached the ground after 8.8 seconds. How tall is the building?
(Use the formula: d = v i t + ½ a t 2 ; a g = -9.8 m/s 2)

He didn’t understand why the teacher would get mad at him, he looked at the crayons and looked out of the window. He didn’t see anything wrong so he continued coloring pictures that way.  Again and again, his teacher kept on telling him that what he was doing was wrong. So, he started to shy away from his classmates because of embarrassment. Manuel’s teacher became concerned. She called the boy’s parents to school. After consulting with Manuel’s parents, she found out that he was colorblind.  The teacher apologized to Manuel’s parents.

                            12. Little Manuel’s teacher reprimanded him for coloring the leaves on the trees yellow and the sky orange.  He didn’t understand why the teacher would get mad at him, he looked at the crayons and looked out of the window. He didn’t see anything wrong so he continued coloring pictures that way. Again and again, his teacher kept on telling him that what he was doing was wrong. So, he started to shy away from his classmates because of embarrassment. Manuel’s teacher became concerned. She called the boy’s parents to school. After consulting with Manuel’s parents, she found out that he was colorblind. The teacher apologized to Manuel’s parents.
