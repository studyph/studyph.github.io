                                            Steps in graphing systems of linear inequalities in two variables1. Rewrite each mathematical statement into slope-intercept form  =  + , where  is the slope and  is the y-intercept.2. Graph the system of linear inequalities in two variables in a Cartesian coordinate plane. a. Locate the y – intercept or the point (0, b). It is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis.b. From the y-intercept, use the value of the slope in going up or down or running left or right to locate another point/s.c. Use broken lines for linear inequalities using &lt; and &gt;, and solid lines for linear inequalities using ≤ and ≥.d. Shade the region above the graph of  ≥  + and  &gt;  +  and shade the region below the graph of  ≤  +  or  &lt;  + .e. Do the same steps in graphing the other given linear inequality in two variables.3. Observe the shaded regions. The area where the shaded regions overlapped is where the solutions of the system of linear inequalities are located. It means that all the points in that area make the system of linear inequalities in two variable is true.​</a>

Heat energy is the total energy of the substance, while kinetic energy is the energy of motion. During a phase change, the heat energy is used to break or form the bonds between molecules. As a result, the kinetic energy of the molecules does not change, but the behavior of the molecules changes as they move from one state of matter to another. Temperature affects the behavior of molecules by determining the rate of movement or kinetic energy of the molecules.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            13. Khalid and Jesse took different overnight trains. The graph shows the relationship between the total distance Khalid travelled and the time in hours. The distance that Jesse travelled after x hours is given by the equation y = 150x. Khalids Travel graph of a diagonal line on a coordinate plane going up and to the right with Time in hours on the x axis and Distance in miles on the y axis. The line begins at the origin and passes through the point 1 comma 140.</h2><br />
                        <p>Since the graph is a diagonal line, the distance travelled by Khalid is directly proportional to the time. Thus, the equation of the line representing Khalid's travel is of the form y = kx, where k is the constant of proportionality.</p><p></p><p>Substituting the coordinates of the point that the line passes through, we get 140 = k(1). Solving for k, we get k = 140. Hence, the equation of the line representing Khalid's travel is y = 140x.</p><p></p><p>To compare the distance travelled by Khalid and Jesse, we substitute the same value of x in both equations. For example, if x = 3 hours, then the distance travelled by Khalid is 140x = 140(3) = 420 miles, and the distance travelled by Jesse is 150x = 150(3) = 450 miles. Since 450 &gt; 420, Jesse travelled a greater distance than Khalid in 3 hours.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Jesse travelled a greater distance than Khalid in all time intervals.</p>_______________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. To explain the motion of an object, we use our science process skills speciallyourobservation. When we observe something, we come up with the same
observations but different explanation. That is why we use diagram, charts or graphs to describe motion usingspecificmeasurement on how fast or how far the object was going</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Additionally, we use mathematical equations such as speed, velocity, acceleration, and displacement to quantify and analyze the motion of an object. By measuring the changes in position and time, we can determine the velocity and speed of an object. Acceleration, on the other hand, is determined by measuring the rate of change of velocity over time. Displacement is the distance and direction of an object from its starting point.</p><p></p><p>Through these observations and measurements, we can create models and predictions about the behavior of objects in motion. We can also use this information to make informed decisions, such as designing safer vehicles or predicting the path of a moving object. Overall, observation and measurement are essential tools in understanding the motion of objects and the world around us.

                            16. Steps in graphing systems of linear inequalities in two variables1. Rewrite each mathematical statement into slope-intercept form  =  + , where  is the slope and  is the y-intercept.2. Graph the system of linear inequalities in two variables in a Cartesian coordinate plane. a. Locate the y – intercept or the point (0, b). It is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis.b. From the y-intercept, use the value of the slope in going up or down or running left or right to locate another point/s.c. Use broken lines for linear inequalities using &lt; and &gt;, and solid lines for linear inequalities using ≤ and ≥.d. Shade the region above the graph of  ≥  + and  &gt;  +  and shade the region below the graph of  ≤  +  or  &lt;  + .e. Do the same steps in graphing the other given linear inequality in two variables.3. Observe the shaded regions. The area where the shaded regions overlapped is where the solutions of the system of linear inequalities are located. It means that all the points in that area make the system of linear inequalities in two variable is true.​</h2><br />
