                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The pandemic has us taking a serious look at how orientation and training is delivered. We're also eliminating the paper forms we can and automating them so they don't have to be circulated physically. Many of these changes will be permanent. Universal precautions for our first aid team have been strengthened, and we've provided face shield to Team Members who speak with truck drivers. Again- great improvements we should keep.</p><p>I believe that many people, not just construction workers, have gotten into a habit of not washing hands after using the toilet. I truly wonder each time I have shaken hands over the years who is washing and who is not. but always trying to keep awareness up with our crews about working in a dirty environment means cleaning hands before eating. Also, that contaminated clothing needs to be removed and bagged before getting into a car, and transferred to your loving family at home. If we think about what we are doing at work, do we really want to expose our families with the products we encounter on a daily basis? As for safety and health in general, I know that our company will stock better with the items that are in such short supply right now. As an "Essential Employees - Exempt" company we are continuing to work on most of our job sites, and now have very little PPE for hospital and medical office work. Our supplies have always been acquired when the job called for it, and not keeping a huge stock. Our hearts go out to the families that have lost someone due to this outbreak, and we hope and pray that it does nor consume us as a nation.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>hope it helps </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my honest opinion, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. And we need to develop long-term sustainable strategies to address the challenges facing the health and agri-food sectors. Thus, we must rethink the future of our environment and tackle climate change and environmental degradation with ambition and urgency. Only then can we protect the health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition of all people, and ensure that our ‘new normal’ is a better one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>:&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>I believe that this misfortune became an opportunity for Filipinos to be more creative at finding ways on how to have a source of income: some tried online selling which led to the rise of e-commerce and others looked for sidelines, which includes accepting drawing commissions online. Also, the concept of Bayanihan was popularized and we often help each other now through the rising number of community pantries.</p><p></p><p>My point of view is, children who sleep well will perform daily tasks better and with efficiency, they can also think well at school, and be protected from flu and other illnesses.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, parents are their children's teachers in this pandemic because we are under the new distance learning modalities, so they should look after their son's/daughter's school performance and help them in understanding concepts and answering modules (but they shouldn't answer it themselves). There might also be tendencies where the student feels demotivated or stressed due to school works, and their parents should make them feel otherwise by providing their outmost support and empathy for what their child is feeling.</p><p></p><p>I suggest, these health protocols should be implemented more strictly. Since everyone is not vaccinated yet or even if we already received our doses, still, we must observe social distancing and wearing of face masks and face shields because vaccines can't fully protect us from the v*rus. </p><p></p><p>I feel like it is not true. There's no guarantee that all students answer their modules with their own knowledge, because some convince their parents, relatives, or non-relatives to answer it for them, while others practice plagiarism by copy pasting whatever they've searched from the internet.</p><br />
