Edwards (2007) explored the process of college men’s gender identity development. In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.

It focuses on the "why" rather than the "what" of social phenomena and relies on the direct experiences of human beings as meaning-making agents in their every day lives. Rather than by logical and statistical procedures, qualitative researchers use multiple systems of inquiry for the study of human phenomena including biography, case study, historical analysis, discourse analysis, ethnography, grounded theory, and phenomenology.</p><p></p><p>8.While narrative analysis as a genre of interpretation includes several different frameworks, there are four typical narrative forms of analyses that may be used in concert with one another in a given study: structural, functional, thematic, and dialogic/performance.</p><p></p><p>9.Phenomenological Study  Aims to find the essence or structure of an experience by explaining how complex meanings are built out of simple units of inner experience, for example, the essence of being a participant in a particular program or the essence of understanding a subject.</p><p></p><p>10.Causal Design. Causality studies may be thought of as understanding a phenomenon in terms of conditional statements in the form, “If X, then Y.” This type of research is used to measure what impact a specific change will have on existing norms and assumptions.</p><p></p><p>11.</p><p></p><p>12.A cohort study is a type of longitudinal research that samples a cohort (a group of people with a shared characteristic) while doing a cross-section at specific time intervals.</p><p></p><p>13.</p><p></p><p>14.There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.</p><p></p><p>15.</p><br />

                            16. Choose the correct qualitative research design used in the following examples. Edwards (2007) explored the process of college men’s gender identity development. In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.
