Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and treeE. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land Activity 2: The Three R’s What to do: Decide whe​</a>

What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and tree planting.E. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land ​</a>

                        Answer:<p></p>How Is Water Stored on Earth?<p>•Approximately 1.7% is stored in the polar icecaps, glaciers, and permanent snow.</p><p></p><p>•Another 1.7% is stored in groundwater, lakes, rivers, streams, and soil. </p><p></p><p>•And 97% of the world's water is stored in the oceans as saltwater.</p><p></p><p>•Only a thousandth of 1% of the water on Earth exists as water vapor in the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>: These water storage areas are most commonly known as reservoirs. Natural reservoirs include oceans, glaciers and other bodies of ice, groundwater, lakes, soil moisture, wetlands, living organisms, the atmosphere, and rivers.</p><p></p>How Much Water Does The Earth Have?<p>•The total volume of water on Earth is estimated at 1.386 billion km³ (333 million cubic miles), with 97.5% being salt water and 2.5% being fresh water. Of the fresh water, only 0.3% is in liquid form on the surface.</p><p></p>How Does Water Shape Land?<p>•The water shape the land In every process of erosion, abrasion is causing the land to change their form. A stream's ability to erode depends mainly on its speed. Water erosion forms V-shaped valleys, waterfalls, meanders, and oxbow lakes.</p><br />

                            12. .Science 4 – Week 6First QuarterOctober 21, 2021I. Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and treeE. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land Activity 2: The Three R’s What to do: Decide whe​</h2><br />

                            23. .Science 4 – Week 6First QuarterOctober 21, 2021I. Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and tree planting.E. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land ​</h2><br />
