To convince the reader, use emphasis markers to show importance about whatare trying to pinpoint. If you have trouble finding a topic, answer one of the followquestions1. What school policy would you change or enact if you could?2. Who is the greatest historical figure of all time in the Philippines?3. Should public school students wear uniforms?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I would change the wearing of school uniforms due to the fact that some students are not comfortable wearing them and that would lead them to not focusing properly in school. Although we still need to follow the dress code. And most people now a days express how they feel through the way they dress. Feeling comfortable makes us focus more and it makes us be ourselves better. </p><p>2. In my opinion, it is Jose Rizal because even our past heroes said that Jose Rizal's sacrifice was the biggest one of all. He persuaded filipino's to fight harder and dream bigger through his novels, stories, etc. He was very smart and he helped filipino's so much, let's not forget that he loves Philippines so much. </p><p>3. For me, I think no because as I said earlier they might not be comfortable and some students can't afford uniforms. Although it is up to them because I am just stating my opinions and probably they like uniforms better, but wearing what you're comfortable with helps a lot because your mind is gonna get motivated and it will want to learn more. </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps </p><br />
