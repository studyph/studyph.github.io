If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do itwhile your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking anactive part in your education and should attempt to explain the material in a different way. If you are stillconfused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worthit. Don't give up on yourself.Narrator's Perspective:Explain how you know:​</h2><br />

                            27. When there is no rain for a long period of time, natural bodies of water seemed to disappear because of evaporation. This is also the reason why the cost of fish in the market becomes higher than the regular price. A businessman (teacher) would like to invest on fishponds to solve the problem and to earn at the same time. You are an engineer who knows how to make a design-layout of a fishpond and the businessman needs your help. The investor would like to have a circular shape for the base of the pond with sides of a parabola for the shallow part. Therefore, the pond looks like a circle inscribed in a parabola. You are going to prepare the design and layout of the pond supported with equations involving conic sections. Your output will be graded by its relevance, manner of presentation, mathematical content, and feasibility.​</h2><br />
