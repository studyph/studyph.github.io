MGEllig-1 MEASURING A RIVER How Napoleon's Engineer Found a River's Width without Instruments Did you experence being asked to find the length or the width of an object without directly measuring it? For instance, you finding the width of the river without actually crossing it. Do you think it is possible? Find tout by reading the story below and do the task that follows. Legend has it that the great emperor, Napoleon while standing on the bank of a wide tiver, ordered one of his officials to determine its with so he could attack the enemy with artilery on the other side. B S The official answered that he needed to get his instruments to carry out the order. But the emperor insisted that he required an immediate answer The official quickdy devised a plan. Standing straight on the riverbank, he lowered the visor of his cap until the farthest thing he could see was the edge of the opposite bank. While maintaining the angle for which he bent his head, he slowly turned and noted the spot that was in line with his eye and the tip of his visor. And there he had it He was able to give the emperor the width of the river. Task It's Your Turn! you were the official faced with the challenge of cetem ng the width of the river without actually measuring it would you do the same? Why or why not? Support your answer by stating your plan in solving the change​</a>

Vertical growing vegetable gardens D. Four-squar layout E. Single-Row 6. It is also called close row or wide row planting. This method increases yields significantly over a traditional row style garden. 7. It is generally set up in grids of 4 x 4 squares with strings or wood attached to the frame to divide the bed into equal square-foot sections.  8. This garden is designed for people having little or no traditional garden space. 9. This is created by straight paths, one leading from the garden gate to the front entry of the house, and the other crossing it at a 90-degree angle. 10. It is the most basic garden plan that consists of a design with straight, long rows running in north to south orientation,​</a>

                                            1. DOTAINIRA HYREPAT - ____________________ X-rays play an important role in the fight against cancer, with high energyradiation used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can bedangerous, yet it’s still received by around 50% of cancer patients during thecourse of their treatment. 2. UTERCYSI NAGNICSN - ____________________ Almost every airport on the planet is now fitted with some form of x-ray securitysystem that scans baggage to check for dangerous items. In the past few years,full body x-ray scans have also emerged as an additional security measure. 3. CEDLAIM GODASINIS - ____________________ Doctors use x-ray machines to take photographs of a patient’s body. Aphotographic film is placed behind the body, with the x-ray then turned on. Therays easily pass through the skin, but take a little longer to travel through thebone. This is why bones appear much lighter in color. Using the results, doctorscan develop effective treatment plans.4. RHIGLOPTYHA - ____________________ One of the more important commercial applications of X radiation is in theelectronics industry, particularly, in the manufacture of high density integratedcircuits. The integrated circuit chips are made by etching successive layers ofelectric circuitry into a wafer of semiconducting material such as silicon. The sizeof the circuit elements is limited by the wavelength of the light: the shorter thewavelength, the smaller the circuit elements. If x rays are used instead of light,the circuits on the wafer can be made much smaller and many more elementscan be put on a wafer of a given size, permitting the manufacture of smallerelectronic devices such as computers. 5. UMECTROP LAIAX PORYTHOMAG - ____________________ A relatively new technique for using x rays produces a cross-sectional picture of apart of the body which is much sharper than a normal x ray. To produce this scan, a narrow beam of x rays is sent through the region of interest from many differentangles and a computer is used to reconstruct the cross-sectional picture of thatregion.​</a>

Balance</p><p>8. Coordination</p><p>9. Reaction TIme</p><p>10. Muscular Endurance</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>Agility </strong>is the ability to move and change the direction and position of the body quickly and effectively while under control. It requires quick reflexes, coordination, balance, speed, and correct response to the changing situation<strong>Cardiovascular endurance</strong> is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to working muscles and tissues, as well as the ability of those muscles and tissues to utilize that oxygen over an extended period of time with moderate intensity.<strong>Speed </strong>is the rate at which someone can move all or part of their body when performing a movement or covering a distance. Speed in PE is important as it makes up one of the components of fitness'The term '<strong>Flexibility' </strong>refers to the body's ability to move a joint (or series of joints) fully and painlessly through a natural range of movement <strong>Power i</strong>s defined as the ability to act or have influence over others. An example of power is the strength needed to run five miles . An example of power is the authority a local government has to collect taxes. ... The definition of power is operating electrically or having strength or force.<strong>Body composition</strong> is a method of breaking down the body into its core components: fat, protein, minerals, and body water<strong>Balance</strong>: The ability to maintain position whether that is static, dynamic (moving) or rotational <strong>Coordination</strong> is the ability to use different parts of the body together smoothly and efficiently. <strong>Reaction time</strong> is the amount of time it takes to respond to a stimulus . An example of reaction time is when a bug stings within 1 second of being approached<strong> Muscular endurance </strong>is how many times you can move that weight without getting exhausted (very tired) .<br />

                            16. 1. DOTAINIRA HYREPAT - ____________________ X-rays play an important role in the fight against cancer, with high energyradiation used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can bedangerous, yet it’s still received by around 50% of cancer patients during thecourse of their treatment. 2. UTERCYSI NAGNICSN - ____________________ Almost every airport on the planet is now fitted with some form of x-ray securitysystem that scans baggage to check for dangerous items. In the past few years,full body x-ray scans have also emerged as an additional security measure. 3. CEDLAIM GODASINIS - ____________________ Doctors use x-ray machines to take photographs of a patient’s body. Aphotographic film is placed behind the body, with the x-ray then turned on. Therays easily pass through the skin, but take a little longer to travel through thebone. This is why bones appear much lighter in color. Using the results, doctorscan develop effective treatment plans.4. RHIGLOPTYHA - ____________________ One of the more important commercial applications of X radiation is in theelectronics industry, particularly, in the manufacture of high density integratedcircuits. The integrated circuit chips are made by etching successive layers ofelectric circuitry into a wafer of semiconducting material such as silicon. The sizeof the circuit elements is limited by the wavelength of the light: the shorter thewavelength, the smaller the circuit elements. If x rays are used instead of light,the circuits on the wafer can be made much smaller and many more elementscan be put on a wafer of a given size, permitting the manufacture of smallerelectronic devices such as computers. 5. UMECTROP LAIAX PORYTHOMAG - ____________________ A relatively new technique for using x rays produces a cross-sectional picture of apart of the body which is much sharper than a normal x ray. To produce this scan, a narrow beam of x rays is sent through the region of interest from many differentangles and a computer is used to reconstruct the cross-sectional picture of thatregion.​</h2><br />
