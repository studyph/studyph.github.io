                                            What is It Reflection is the bouncing of light rays when it hits a surface like a plane mirror. Plane mirrors exhibits regular reflection where the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. All plane shiny surfaces exhibit this kind of reflection. Irregular or diffused reflection illuminates shaded areas such as under the trees and inside buildings. This is observed in objects with irregular surfaces such as rocks, buildings etc. The first law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The angle is measured between the normal line and the incident ray while the angle of reflection is measured between the normal line and the reflected ray. The arrowhead shows the direction of light. The second law states that the normal line, incident ray and reflected ray all lie in the same plane. That means, what you see on the mirror is an image which appears to be at the back of the mirror. The characteristics of images formed by plane mirrors is describe in terms of type of image, orientation, location and size. For plane mirrors, the type of image is virtual formed behind. Virtual image is an image formed when an outgoing ray from an object always diverge (move apart). The image you see when you are looking at yourself in a plane mirror is virtual. This image is formed by extending the light rays behind the mirror. The image orientation is erect, laterally inverted The image is located at the same distance from the mirror as the object distance. The image formed is of the same size as the object. In other words, the image and the object in plane mirrors has the same characteristics except that the image is seen as laterally inverted. Lateral inversion is a phenomenon wherein what is left on the object appears as right on the image and vice versa, This is due to the direction that light follows when it strikes a reflecting surface generally like a mirror.​</a>

                                            SKY COLORSHave you ever wondered why clear skies are sometimes deep blueand at other times almost white? Or why some sunsets are fiery red and otherswatery yellow? The reason is that the mixture of particles in the atmosphere isconstantly changing. Every color in the sky comes from the Sun. Sunlight iswhite, which means it is a mix of every color in the rainbow. But as it passesthrough the atmosphere, gases, dust, ice crystals, and water droplets split it intothe various colors, bouncing some toward our eyes and absorbing others. Thecolors we see depend on which colors are reflected and which are absorbed. Clearskies are blue because gases in the air reflect mostly blue light from the Sun. Thesky gets paler when extra dust or moisture reflects other colors, diluting the blue.Sunsets are yellow (or red, if the air is dusty) because the Sun's rays have totravel so far through the lower atmosphere that all the yellow light is absorbed.A.

What kind of paragraph is it? A. Explanation Text B. Enumeration Text C. Time-order Text The atmosphere is composed of different levels. The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11 km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48 km above the Earth's surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs the most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55 km. The temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from the Earth. The air is ionized by the sun's ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, thre are six levels of the Earth's atmosphere. 19. What kind of paragraph is it? A. Explanation Text B. Enumeration Text C. Time-order Text​</a>

                            3. What is It Reflection is the bouncing of light rays when it hits a surface like a plane mirror. Plane mirrors exhibits regular reflection where the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. All plane shiny surfaces exhibit this kind of reflection. Irregular or diffused reflection illuminates shaded areas such as under the trees and inside buildings. This is observed in objects with irregular surfaces such as rocks, buildings etc. The first law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The angle is measured between the normal line and the incident ray while the angle of reflection is measured between the normal line and the reflected ray. The arrowhead shows the direction of light. The second law states that the normal line, incident ray and reflected ray all lie in the same plane. That means, what you see on the mirror is an image which appears to be at the back of the mirror. The characteristics of images formed by plane mirrors is describe in terms of type of image, orientation, location and size. For plane mirrors, the type of image is virtual formed behind. Virtual image is an image formed when an outgoing ray from an object always diverge (move apart). The image you see when you are looking at yourself in a plane mirror is virtual. This image is formed by extending the light rays behind the mirror. The image orientation is erect, laterally inverted The image is located at the same distance from the mirror as the object distance. The image formed is of the same size as the object. In other words, the image and the object in plane mirrors has the same characteristics except that the image is seen as laterally inverted. Lateral inversion is a phenomenon wherein what is left on the object appears as right on the image and vice versa, This is due to the direction that light follows when it strikes a reflecting surface generally like a mirror.​</h2><br />

                            20. SKY COLORSHave you ever wondered why clear skies are sometimes deep blueand at other times almost white? Or why some sunsets are fiery red and otherswatery yellow? The reason is that the mixture of particles in the atmosphere isconstantly changing. Every color in the sky comes from the Sun. Sunlight iswhite, which means it is a mix of every color in the rainbow. But as it passesthrough the atmosphere, gases, dust, ice crystals, and water droplets split it intothe various colors, bouncing some toward our eyes and absorbing others. Thecolors we see depend on which colors are reflected and which are absorbed. Clearskies are blue because gases in the air reflect mostly blue light from the Sun. Thesky gets paler when extra dust or moisture reflects other colors, diluting the blue.Sunsets are yellow (or red, if the air is dusty) because the Sun's rays have totravel so far through the lower atmosphere that all the yellow light is absorbed.A.

                            25. Tsunami The term "Tsunami" comes from the Japanese which means harbor ("tsu") and wave ("name"). A tsunamis a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. A tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water Such large vertical movement of the earth's crust can occur at plate boundaries. 18. What kind of paragraph is it? A. Explanation Text B. Enumeration Text C. Time-order Text The atmosphere is composed of different levels. The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11 km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48 km above the Earth's surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs the most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55 km. The temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from the Earth. The air is ionized by the sun's ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, thre are six levels of the Earth's atmosphere. 19. What kind of paragraph is it? A. Explanation Text B. Enumeration Text C. Time-order Text​</h2><br />
