                                            What is It Assessing literature Literature from the Period of Emergence and Development shows a significant trend as Filipino writers become more competent in the English language and gain mastery in patriotic and resistance literature. Recall the Ifugao folk song, "After Harvest." Details and images like laugh and shout, dance and sing show the attitude of Filipinos, as they celebrate after a long day of hard work. The setting of the poem also suggests that the event transpired in a rice field, which is a common sight in Ifugao. In this selection, one can also imply that the characters' livelihood depends on rice crops.​</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all.

Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of DocumentPurpose of the ReviewWriter’s PersonaIntended ReaderStrengthsWeaknesses​</a>

Recall the Ifugao folk song, "After Harvest." Details and images like laugh and shout, dance and sing show the attitude of Filipinos, as they celebrate after a long day of hard work. The setting of the poem also suggests that the event transpired in a rice field, which is a common sight in Ifugao. In this selection, one can also imply that the characters' livelihood depends on rice crops.​</a>

Recall the Ifugao folk song, "After Harvest." Details and images like laugh and shout, dance and sing show the attitude of Filipinos, as they celebrate after a long day of hard work. The setting of the poem also suggests that the event transpired in a rice field, which is a common sight in Ifugao.

                            5. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

                            9. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all.

What is It Assessing literature Literature from the Period of Emergence and Development shows a significant trend as Filipino writers become more competent in the English language and gain mastery in patriotic and resistance literature. Recall the Ifugao folk song, "After Harvest." Details and images like laugh and shout, dance and sing show the attitude of Filipinos, as they celebrate after a long day of hard work. The setting of the poem also suggests that the event transpired in a rice field, which is a common sight in Ifugao.

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Published in 1946, Ginto Sa Makiling – a novel by Macario Pineda, is the first work of note that appeared after the second world war. In plot, it hews close to the mode of romantic fantasy traceable to the awits, koridos and komedyas of the Balagtas tradition. But it is a symbolical narrative of social, moral and political import. In this, it resembles not only Balagtas but also Rizal, but in style and plot it is closer to Balagtas in not allowing the realistic mode to restrict the element of fantasy.</p><p></p><p>       Two novels by writers in English dealt with the war experience: (Medina, p. 194) Stevan Javellana’s Without Seeing the Dawn (1947), and Edilberto Tiempo’s Watch in the Night. Both novels hew closely to the realist tradition. Lazaro Francisco, the eminent Tagalog novelist of the pre-war years, was to continue to produce significant work. He revised his Bayaning Nagpatiwakal (1932), refashioning its plot and in sum honing his work as a weapon against the policies that tended to perpetuate American economic dominance over the Philippines. The updated novel was titled Ilaw Sa Hilaga (1948) (Lumbera, p. 67). He was to produce three more novels.Sugat Sa Alaala (1950) reflects the horrors of the war experience as well as the human capacity for nobility, endurance and love under the most extreme circumstances. Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig (1956) deals with the agrarian issue, and Daluyong (1962) deals with the corruption bred by the American-style and American-educated pseudo-reformers. Lazaro Francisco is a realist with social and moral ideals. The Rizal influence on his work is profound.</p><p></p><p>       The poet Amado Hernandez, who was also union leader and social activist, also wrote novels advocating social change. Luha ng Buwaya (1963) (Lumbera) deals with the struggle between the oppressed peasantry and the class of politically powerful landlords. Mga Ibong Mandaragit (1969) deals with the domination of Filipinos by American industry (Lumbera, p. 69).</p><p></p><p>       Unfortunately, the Rizalian path taken by Lazaro Francisco and Amado Hernandez with its social-realist world-view had the effect of alienating them from the mode of the highly magical oral-epic tradition. Imported social realism (and, in the case of Amado Hernandez, a brand of socialist empiricism), was not entirely in touch with the folk sentiment and folk belief, which is why the Tagalog romances (e.g., Ginto Sa Makiling, serialized in the comics), were far more popular than their work.</p><p></p><p>       </p><br />
