(S PTS each) A Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. There are a million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic diversity on Earth. Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global climate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The human genome, for example, contains 200,000 segments of virus DNA. Why do you think it is important for dentists to study about viruses? 6 When I was a little boy in elementary school, the neighborhood kids and I all looked fonvard to playing so many games in my backyard during the long summer holidays between grades.

(S PTS each) A Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. There are a million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic diversity on Earth. Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global climate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The human genome, for example, contains 200,000 segments of virus DNA. Why do you think it is important for dentists to study about viruses? 6 When I was a little boy in elementary school, the neighborhood kids and I all looked fonvard to playing so many games in my backyard during the long summer holidays between grades. For instance, one of our favorite games was whiffle ball, a kid's version of baseball. All we needed was a cheap plastic bat and a cheap plastic ball and we could entertain ourselves in the backyard from morning to afternoon. Or if we broke the bat or lost the ball, we would play​</h2><br />

                            17. why do we need to study about global warming?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global warming is a term used for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Scientists are more than 95% certain that nearly all of global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other human-caused emissions.  </p><p>
</p><p>Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation. Increasing or decreasing amounts of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.
</p><p>
</p><p>Our atmosphere is getting hotter, more turbulent, and more unpredictable because of the “boiling and churning” effect caused by the heat-trapping greenhouse gases within the upper layers of our atmosphere. With each increase of carbon, methane, or other greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, our local weather and global climate is further agitated, heated, and “boiled.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Global warming is gauged by the increase in the average global temperature of the Earth. Along with our currently increasing average global temperature, some parts of the Earth may actually get colder while other parts get warmer—hence the idea of average global temperature. Greenhouse gas-caused atmospheric heating and agitation also increase the unpredictability of the weather and climate and dramatically increase the severity, scale, and frequency of storms, droughts, wildfires, and extreme temperatures.
</p><p>
</p><p>Global warming can reach levels of irreversibility as it has now, and increasing levels of global warming can eventually reach an extinction level where humanity and all life on earth will end. In this book, irreversible global warming is partially defined as a continuum of increasing temperature that causes the global climate to rapidly change until those higher temperatures become irreversible on practical human time scales. The eventual temperature range associated with triggering and marking the beginning of the irreversible global warming processes is an increase in average global temperature of 2.2°-4° Celsius (4°-7.2° Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. For the full definition of irreversible global warming and how this has happened to us, click here.
</p><p>
</p><p>Extinction level global warming is defined in this book as temperatures exceeding preindustrial levels by 5-6° Celsius (9-10.8° Fahrenheit) or the extinction of all planetary life, or the eventual loss of our atmosphere. If our atmosphere is also lost, this is referred to as runaway global warming. The result would be similar to what is thought to have happened to Venus 4 billion years ago, resulting in a carbon-rich atmosphere and minimum surface temperatures of 462 °C.
</p><p>
</p><p>The temperature levels described above for irreversible and extinction-level global warming are not hard and rigid boundaries, but boundary ranges that describe the related consequences and their intensities within a certain level of global warming. These temperature boundary levels may be modified by future research. More about how irreversible global warming and extinction-level global warming can come about because of complex interactions will be explained in the tipping point information will set the foundation necessary to understand how we are already creating the conditions that have not only created irreversible global warming, but also extinction-level global warming if we keep going as we are now.
</p><p>
</p><p>The concentration of the human-caused carbon pollution of our atmosphere has nearly doubled in 60 years—and it is continuing to escalate at faster and faster rates.
</p><p>
</p><p>Carbon in the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning isn’t our only problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>While the situation is critical, it is still possible to slow and lessen global warming enough for the climate to establish a new, stable equilibrium. However, that equilibrium may be unlike anything previously seen in Earth’s history and it may not be suitable for humanity to thrive.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>tell me if I'm wrong </p><p>Hope it helps</p><p>#KeppOnLearning</p><br />
