                                            Engagement is an agreement entered between two people in love, a means of knowing each other and their families well, a way to ensure that they are ready and are suited for life-long companionship. It also provides opportunity to develop interpersonal skills useful before and even within marriage. It is the time to understand and explore each other's strengths and weaknesses so they can adjust to one another. Learning Task 1: If you are engaged, which do you prefer, Long Engagement or Short Engagement period? Explain. Write your answer in your activity notebook. Learning Task 2: On a separate sheet of paper, draw, and color your ideal man / woman. Below your drawing, write the characteristics you expect from him/her. Learning Task 3: You already know what you want in terms of the period of engagement and the characteristics of your ideal partner. This time, you will read about marriage and the factors that contribute to a successful marriage. These will help you prepare and plan out your dream family.​</a>

                                            2. Here are ways to take some of the danger out of smoking. First of all, choose * cigarette with less tar and nicotine. The difference between branda (including those with filters) can be as much as two to one, even more. See how much you can reduce your tar and nicotine intake by switching. Also, don't smoke your cigarette all the way down. You get the most tar and nicotine from the last few puffs because the tobacco itself acts as a filter. Smoke halfway and you get only about 40 percent of the total tar and nicotine. The last half of the cigarette will give you 60 percent. Another help is to take fewer draws on each cigarette. Just reduce the number of times you puff on each cigarette and you ll cut down on your smoking without really missing it. In addition, you should reduce your inhaling. Remember, you're not standing on a mountain gulping in fresh air; so, dont welcome it with open lungs. Don't inhale as deeply; take short shallow drags. Practice on a big cigar. Finally, you should smoke fewer cigarettes each day. For some people this is easy, but for others it may be the most difficult step of all. Don't think of it as cutting down; think of it as postponing. It's always easier to postpone a cigarette if you know you'll be having one later. Carry your cigarettes in a different pocket; at work, keep them in a desk drawer or a locker any place where you can't reach for one automatically. The trick is to change your habit patterns.

                                            Making and Keeping FriendsMaking and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. pakisagutan plsss need kona po asap plss po​</a>

                                            Making and Keeping Friends Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. 1. Encircle the big Idea. 2. Draw a rectangle around each of the three MainTopics .

But it spreads in the coughs and sneezes of people who are sick and when they touch people or things around them.

The virus affects many kinds of people and everyone can help fight it. Children are special and they can help too. You need to stay safe for all of us. I need you to be my hero." "Heroes have superpowers”. She said to herself closing her eyes to sleep. "I need a way to tell all children in the world how to protect everyone else, Sarah said. "I need something that can fly, something with a big voice and something that can help!" she added. Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of her. What are you? asked Sara "I'm Pedro, a flying Pegasus," it replied. "I never seen a Pegasus before. Sara whispered. “Maybe if I have you, I can tell all the children in the world about Coronavirus," said Sara. "Yes sure. Nothing can harm you when we're together," replied Pedro. Sara jumped on Pedro's back and together they soared out through her bedroom window, into the night sky. They flew towards the stars and said hello to the moon. They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses. But you remind me that we can all be heroes every day," Sara's mom said. 1. What is Sara's mom's profession? 2. What causes people to get sick? 3.

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1.

                                            The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. The Spanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos then made use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk' touch. Aside from the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinos can draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comes together to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. A group of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a very beautiful thing I proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in many places around the Philippines especially in Manila. there has been a loss of the sense of community with the rise of capitalism and profit oriented mindset, it has become every man for himsell. The sense of community needs to be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization that we as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and the improvement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life that comes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. I mean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors.

I came to understand that discipline is something that needs to be ingrained in a root system in order to grow deeper over time and resist being easily swept away by life's storms. The most crucial component of a tree is its root, which is also one of its basic components. It will never become a tree if they lack a root.

When I am dealing with all types of individuals and in various situations, I appreciate having diverse personas. I admire myself for being such a courageous and sincere individual. I admire myself for setting boundaries in all the relationships I am in or for restricting my partnerships. I admire myself for having such talents. Some people have said that I am good at both singing and dancing, which I love to do. I don't care what other people think of me because I adore the things that make me who I am as a person.</p><p></p><p><strong>Branches: </strong>I have many hopes, dreams, and wishes for the future. I hope to have a good life for my family and for myself. I hope that we will never experience financial crisis again like we are experiencing right now. I wish that we could all be together once more to share meals, go to lovely locations, laugh together, and do everything else that a family should do. I dream to become successful to my chosen career and maximize my potentials and knowledge in the field. Lastly, I wish that poor and unfortunate people will find their way to a prosperous and successful life.</p><p></p><p><strong>Leaves: </strong>My only resource for pursuing my life's ambitions is myself. I am the only one who can carry on in life, no matter what the circumstances. Only when times are tough and when I have triumphed in my inner conflicts do I have myself.

                            6. 2. Here are ways to take some of the danger out of smoking. First of all, choose * cigarette with less tar and nicotine. The difference between branda (including those with filters) can be as much as two to one, even more. See how much you can reduce your tar and nicotine intake by switching. Also, don't smoke your cigarette all the way down. You get the most tar and nicotine from the last few puffs because the tobacco itself acts as a filter. Smoke halfway and you get only about 40 percent of the total tar and nicotine. The last half of the cigarette will give you 60 percent. Another help is to take fewer draws on each cigarette. Just reduce the number of times you puff on each cigarette and you ll cut down on your smoking without really missing it. In addition, you should reduce your inhaling. Remember, you're not standing on a mountain gulping in fresh air; so, dont welcome it with open lungs. Don't inhale as deeply; take short shallow drags. Practice on a big cigar. Finally, you should smoke fewer cigarettes each day. For some people this is easy, but for others it may be the most difficult step of all. Don't think of it as cutting down; think of it as postponing. It's always easier to postpone a cigarette if you know you'll be having one later. Carry your cigarettes in a different pocket; at work, keep them in a desk drawer or a locker any place where you can't reach for one automatically. The trick is to change your habit patterns.

                            8. Making and Keeping FriendsMaking and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. pakisagutan plsss need kona po asap plss po​</h2><br />

                            14. Making and Keeping Friends Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other’s happiness and supporting each other when times are tough. A lot of friends have things in common so it’s easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. Showing you care about the other person’s happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends’ faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don’t know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it’s uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it’s nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that’s when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care. 1. Encircle the big Idea. 2. Draw a rectangle around each of the three MainTopics .

"Heroes have superpowers”. She said to herself closing her eyes to sleep. "I need a way to tell all children in the world how to protect everyone else, Sarah said. "I need something that can fly, something with a big voice and something that can help!" she added. Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of her. What are you? asked Sara "I'm Pedro, a flying Pegasus," it replied. "I never seen a Pegasus before. Sara whispered. “Maybe if I have you, I can tell all the children in the world about Coronavirus," said Sara. "Yes sure. Nothing can harm you when we're together," replied Pedro. Sara jumped on Pedro's back and together they soared out through her bedroom window, into the night sky. They flew towards the stars and said hello to the moon. They talked to different people around the world and told them the things they need to do to avoid spreading of coronavirus. “Wash your hands with soap and water. Instead of shaking hands, we wave to people. We try to stay inside especially for crowded city. People must stop travelling and should closed the boarders across the world. Stay at least one meter apart from each other. Isolate yourself if you are not feeling well. We should not stop taking care of one another. “Sara said. "We can do things for each other," Pedro added. Sarah fell asleep and when she woke up the next day, Pedro was gone. Sara ran to her mom with her drawing to tell her the news. “There are many heroes keeping people safe from the Corona virus, like wonderful doctors and nurses.

You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging.

                            30. The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. The Spanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos then made use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk' touch. Aside from the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinos can draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comes together to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. A group of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a very beautiful thing I proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in many places around the Philippines especially in Manila. there has been a loss of the sense of community with the rise of capitalism and profit oriented mindset, it has become every man for himsell. The sense of community needs to be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization that we as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and the improvement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life that comes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. I mean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like in Bataan, there is a store with no tindera just a cash box to drop the cash in. Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The case that comes to mind when the door is unlocked but it is ſine because the neighborhood is safe. The ſecling of being able to depend on the people around you and your community when you need help- all these come from a sense of community This is not something new to our culture. Questions: 1.
