You will discover how thecloud cover affects local temperatures.Materials: Two pieces of A4-sized cartolina, umbrella, rocksProcedure:Note: This activity should be completed during a calm, clear night. You may askyour parent or guardian for supervision.1. Lay the two sheets of cartolina on the grass in an open area. Place a rock on eachsheet to prevent them from being blown away.2. Open the umbrella and prop it on the ground over one sheet of cartolina. Leave theother sheet uncovered. Leave the setups undisturbed for a day.3. The following day, observe the changes that occurred in the two sheets ofcartolina.Guide Questions:1 Did you notice changes in the physical properties of the two sheets of cartolina?2. How is the umbrella similar to the clouds in the atmosphere?3. Which part of the activity made you curious? Explain your answer.​</a>

motion of the object (Cart) as it changes its position (distance) over the course of time.
Procedure:
1. Using the given figure below, interpret the motion of an object based on their distance (paper strip X, Y and
Z).
2. Each dot occurred every 0.20 second, starting from a given point (see Figure 3).
3. Put your answer on the space provided below.

It is important to understand the recipe first then to assemble all the needed ingredients, tools and utensils before starting to bake.Follow the step-by-step procedure accurately 2. Pre-heat the oven. If a thermostat is defective or not available use an oven thermometer to check the baking temperature. 3. Measure ingredients accurately. Do not change the specified amount of ingredients. Any change in the amount of ingredients may result in failure to achieve the desired effect or expected consistency of the mixture. 4. Observe correct hand and mixing techniques. Wrong mixing techniques such as over-mixing, under-mixing, under-beating, or overbeating of eggs, and insufficient creaming will result in poorly baked goods. 5. Make use of the type of pan specified in the recipe. Measure its length, width, and inside depth. Find out in the recipe if the pan(s) should or should not be greased or lined with wax paper. 6. Follow the specified baking time and temperature stated in the recipe. Place the baking pan at the center of the oven and avoid opening the oven door until baking is done.​</a>

                        <p>
<strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Further, visa upon arrival for Chinese nationals has been temporarily suspended.
</p><p>Travel ban to South Korea
</p><p>The Philippines government issued a temporary ban on 26 February on all citizens from travelling to South Korea, as the country reported a spike in the number of confirmed cases.
</p><p>Further, people from the affected regions of South Korea including Gyeongbuk, Daegu and Cheongdo have been banned from entering into the country.
</p><p>Coronavirus in the Philippines: Measures at airports
</p><p>The Philippines Government announced travel restrictions to and from China, Hong Kong, and Macau to minimise the spread. It also banned the entry of passengers from the three countries.
</p><p>Airlines cancelled flights from the Philippines to China resulting in stranding.
</p><p>Face masks shortage – importing from India and Thailand
</p><p>The Philippines witnessed a surge in demand for face masks as fears over the coronavirus infection increased, despite assurance from the government that there is no need to wear face masks yet.
</p><p>The government reiterated that healthcare workers and patients with symptoms of the disease should be given priority for masks.
</p><p>The Philippines International Trading Corporation (PITC), meanwhile, identified two face mask suppliers from India and Thailand to meet the demand for face masks.
</p><p>
</p><p>The suppliers are expected to take more than 30 days to supply the masks. The India-based supplier is expected to supply one million units, while the exact number of face masks that the Thailand-based supplier can supply is yet to be determined.
</p><p>
</p><p>The masks will be imported either by the DoH or the PITC.
</p><p>
</p><p>Coronavirus outbreak: Impact on the Philippines
</p><p>
</p><p>Impact on the economy
</p><p>Philippines witnessed a slower economic growth in the first half of 2019, compared to 2018. The country saw a sustained economic growth of 6.3% between 2010 and 2018, while the growth slowed down to 5.5% in H2 2019. The World Bank estimates Philippines to witness full-year 2019 economic growth of 5.8%.
</p><p>
</p><p>The ongoing coronavirus impact is expected to result in a subdued growth for the economy in 2020.
</p><p>
</p><p>China is Philippines’ top trading partner accounting for 18.8% of total trade, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). In November 2019, 22.9% of Philippines’ exports were to China, the biggest importer for the country.
</p><p>
</p><p>Philippines imports account for approximately 20% of goods from China followed by Korea and Japan at 10% each.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) noted that the coronavirus outbreak could have a major impact on Philippine economy over the next few months.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ruben Carlo Asuncion, chief economist for Union Bank of the Philippines, noted that the coronavirus outbreak could cost the Philippine economy $600m or 0.8% of economic growth if it lasts for six months, as quoted by CNN Philippines.
</p><p>
</p><p>Fiscal measures to contain the coronavirus impact
</p><p>With more than 400 economic zones under lock-down, approximately 700 factories have been shut down displacing hundreds of workers. The Philippines government is a stimulus package of approximately 200 billion pesos ($3.93bn) to protect the citizens and businesses from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The funds are expected to drawn from non-budgetary sources.

</p><p></p><p>When the dots between the ticker tapes are getting wider, then the object is accelerating or moving faster.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Ticker tape</strong> are used in experiment in terms of acceleration, velocity and distance. When the distance between the dots in the ticker tapes are getting smaller, it means the object is slowing down or decelerating.
</p><p>Objects are moving faster or slower depending on the force applied and mass of the object exerted. With higher force, the acceleration of the object increases and lower force causes the object to move slower.

A cross-sectional design is used for research that collects data on relevant variables one time only from a variety of people, subjects or phenomena. 2. Good research designs have some flexibility built into them often this flexibility results from the repetition of essential design features. 3. Good research reflects the theories which are being investigated where specific theoretical expectations can be hypothesized these are incorporated into the design. 4. Research design is necessary because it makes possible the smooth sailing of the various research procedures, thereby creation research as professional as possible, yielding maximum information with a minimum expenditure of effort, time and money. 5. A cross sectional designs are useful for: Establishing a baseline measure,Describing changes over time, Keeping track of trends and Forecasting future ( short term ) trends ​yung nagloloko i rereport ko talaga :)</h2><br />
