                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a speaker, I should know my purpose and method of delivery before giving my speech, so that I can achieve the essence of why I am giving a speech to a target audience. Typically speech purposes are: to inform, persuade, instruct, or entertain.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>As a speaker, I should know my purpose and method of delivery before giving my speech so​ that I don't embarrass myself. Perhaps there is nothing else more embarrassing than delivering the wrong speech to the right people. Can you imagine giving a eulogy to the newlyweds, or how about a sex joke to victims of sexual abuse? While history can be forgotten, somehow the YouTube algorithm has a way of reminding people of their blunders and the internet can be very unforgiving.</p><p></p><p>It is for these reasons why as a speaker I believe I should clearly know the reasons for my speech, the target audience, and even the manner of which I am going to deliver it. In this day and age where political correctness curtails our freedom of speech, we should be vigilant and mindful of every word that comes out from our mouth.</p><br />
