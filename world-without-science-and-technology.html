                                            Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</a>

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

This is all non-sense, if you look for reality beneath the clutter of words which hide it, you will rediscover the eternal man. True values were not invented for the pleasure of senile moralists. They exist because without them, neither society nor happiness could survive. Here, then, are a few rules as old as civilization itself which remain true despite the advances of science and technology. What is the story about? ​</a>

                                            "Importance of mathematics in our daily lives." Mathematics is a topic with its own sense of pride and dignity. Mathematics holds a prominent role in the fields of science and technology, as well as being an important topic in our daily lives. It is a vital subject in our lives. Its use can be found in every field or career. As a result, thorough understanding of the subject is required. Though the fundamentals of mathematics are taught in school, we continue to use them as adults, and therefore arithmetic has become a vital part of our lives. And also it is one of those subjects, whether we like it or not, that people will need for the rest of their lives. Without math, the world would be pure chaos.​</a>

                                            SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses. Fittingly, Singapore's Night Safari received the 1995 ASEAN Tourism Association, Award for Excellence as the best New Tourist Attraction in the ASEAN. Next in line was the Sentosa Island. Accessible from certain points by MRT - Singapore Mass Transit System, bus, or cable car. Sentosa Island is a destination in itself. World, Volcanoland, and Cinemania, Images of Singapore, Fantasy Island, Cinemania.After a hearty lunch at Timbua Restaurant, where we had our fill of delectable Indonesian cuisine, we spent the afternoon looking around spent the afternoon looking around Orchard Road, Singapore's shopping paradise. Along the tretch of Orchard Road can be found mall upon quality merchandise for every mold of shopper. After a generous breakfast buffet, we were whisked to the Singapore Science Center. It was here that we viewed a film at Southeast Asians only Omnimax Theater, where images projected on a dome screen gave us the feeling of being engulfed in the picture. Besides the Omninimax Theater, the Singapore Science enter also houses a variety of exhibits on the life science, technology discoveries, and aviation. As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clark's Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary. With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, especially for some of us who tried Singapore's night life for more taste adventure. The thing with Singapore is, it doesn't really matter if you've been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever- changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same again 1. How will you describe the places in Singapore? 2. How does the author feel about Singapore? 3. Why do you think tourists keep going back there? 4. Why does the author say that Singapore is “constantly discovering and ever-changing”?​</a>

Answer:
Without science there is no human growth, no technological advances, no knowledge generation and the world stagnates. Science is knowledge and without an investment in science the world as we know it would not be possible. Without science the world would stop.

                            5. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</h2><br />

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane?

However, the most important thing that we wouldn't have if science didn't exist is knowledge, it is the most important thing in our lives. We could not do simple things such as washing dishes and turning on a computer. We wouldn't have invented cars, trucks, or other vehicles without science. Due to the contribution of science, human beings now a days live longer because of new inventions of medicine and treatment. Even doctors can transplant the vital organs such as heart, kidney, eyes etc. due the invention of science. So, science brought the modern civilization at this stage where we are today.<br />

                            21. "Importance of mathematics in our daily lives." Mathematics is a topic with its own sense of pride and dignity. Mathematics holds a prominent role in the fields of science and technology, as well as being an important topic in our daily lives. It is a vital subject in our lives. Its use can be found in every field or career. As a result, thorough understanding of the subject is required. Though the fundamentals of mathematics are taught in school, we continue to use them as adults, and therefore arithmetic has become a vital part of our lives. And also it is one of those subjects, whether we like it or not, that people will need for the rest of their lives. Without math, the world would be pure chaos.​</h2><br />

                            25. SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses. Fittingly, Singapore's Night Safari received the 1995 ASEAN Tourism Association, Award for Excellence as the best New Tourist Attraction in the ASEAN. Next in line was the Sentosa Island. Accessible from certain points by MRT - Singapore Mass Transit System, bus, or cable car. Sentosa Island is a destination in itself. World, Volcanoland, and Cinemania, Images of Singapore, Fantasy Island, Cinemania.After a hearty lunch at Timbua Restaurant, where we had our fill of delectable Indonesian cuisine, we spent the afternoon looking around spent the afternoon looking around Orchard Road, Singapore's shopping paradise. Along the tretch of Orchard Road can be found mall upon quality merchandise for every mold of shopper. After a generous breakfast buffet, we were whisked to the Singapore Science Center. It was here that we viewed a film at Southeast Asians only Omnimax Theater, where images projected on a dome screen gave us the feeling of being engulfed in the picture. Besides the Omninimax Theater, the Singapore Science enter also houses a variety of exhibits on the life science, technology discoveries, and aviation. As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clark's Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary. With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, especially for some of us who tried Singapore's night life for more taste adventure. The thing with Singapore is, it doesn't really matter if you've been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever- changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same again 1.
