Attitude  Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</a>

                                            21. For the past decades, dance has played a vital role in the ever-changing world of entertainment.

                                            Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</a>

Identify whether the technique used in writing the following passage is Classification, Cause and Effect, Comparison and Contrast, Analogy, Definition, Persuasion, Process Description, or Interpretation.      Attitude  Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems.

                            17. Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</h2><br />
