Is it when one rallies against a dictator or die for a country? Or is it when one saves a person's life amidst danger? I know one hero, yet she has not died for her country, nor has she saved a person in danger. You would not believe it, but she is someone with a disability. Helen Keller was born on June 27, 1980 in Tuscumbia, Alabama. She was a healthy and happy child, until at 19 months, she was struck by fever which led her to becoming deaf and blind. She learned to cope with her impairments by making signals and sounds to communicate, but soon became very frustrated. However, life for Helen has changed when her teacher, Anne Sullivan, taught her how to read in Braille (a system of raised dots representing letters which are read by feeling the dots), and how to communicate using sign language. Helen graduated from college with honors. She travelled the world and became a speaker in numerous events. She even wrote a story about her life. She was able to overcome her disabilities, achieved many things in her lifetime and inspired and helped disabled persons all over the world. Indeed, anyone can be a hero in his own way. Like Hellen Keller, one can also be a hero by inspiring other people through hard work and perseverance in the midst of difficulties. Questions: YES NO Is it based on facts? If yes, on what fact is it based on? If yes, what makes it a human-interest story? Is it a human-interest story about a person event or place? Does it highlight one aspect or significance of the story? If yes, what is the one aspect of the story that is highlighted? Does it have a heartwarming angle? If yes, what makes the story heartwarming? 2​</a>

An intrapersonal communication used most of first-person pronoun when people are talking to themselves about their feelings by means of thoughts. 3. Communication is enhanced when the relationship exists over a short period of time4. How we communicate with individuals close to us is very similar from the way we communicate with strangers. 5. In a communication process, an individual plays an important role - either he/she becomes the speaker or the receiver. 6. Non-verbal messages are in the form of words, phrases, sentences while verbal messages include signs, symbols, touch, eye contact, body language, facial expressions and gestures. 7. Any problem in the delivery of message can cause communication breakdown. 8. Profiling the target audience of your speech will be more effective if you integrate the purpose for writing and delivering the speech. 9. If chronological presents the idea in time order, comparison/contrast presents an identified problem, its causes and recommended solutions. 10. As part of mechanics in speech writing, punctuate your sentences correctly since this will be your basis for correct intonation and pausing during your speech delivery 11. One step to help you become articulate is to listen to yourself speak wherein you record yourself in a natural conversation, for example, replay a conference call or have a friend interview you on tape and listen for technical issues such as filler words, up talk, monotone, and run-on sentences, as well as any habits that sound awkward or uncomfortable.12. when you control or adjust your voice from low to aloud whisper in order to make your tone more appealing and basically make your voice more dramatic when you adjust the pitch up and down you are modulating13. if you make a mistake during speech delivery ignore it and move on14. according to dorothy from the text read before you go to the stage take off as something that makes you happy and hold on to that . before you begin your speech presentatio15. when you establish rapport with your audience you are making them your partner in a conversation you allies in your presentation.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and analyze the sample text and answer the following question.  How long have you been in quarantine since the coronavirus disease pandemic was declared? What are your thoughts about being quarantined and the COVID19 itself? Here is one creative nonfiction work about it. Hello Corona (by Millind, March 24, 2020)  Hello Corona,    No, I will not call you novel or any such thing. You are a monster that has claimed thousands of lives and infected hundreds of thousands of people across the world and there is no sign of your taming down yet. But you must be the happiest creature in the world these days. After all, you have brought the entire mankind who considered themselves the most superior to all other beings, to their knees. Proud for our superior intellect, ingenuity and technological development over past so many centuries, nearly the entire world except emergency service providers has been locked at home now. We constructed large and beautiful bridges, built monumental towers, statues and sacred places for worship which people visited for centuries. All those places are deserted now.We made airplanes and travelled in each corner of the world. We developed astronomical science, built rockets and travelled in space; we even set our footprint on the moon. But now we are afraid of even stepping outside our homes and you deserve the entire (dis)credit for this. Who are you in reality, Corona… are you a message from the nature that we’ve been ignoring for several decades or maybe, centuries? Are you a blow to us from the nature against whom we tried to prove ourselves superior? We were told time and again that we are part of the entire universal ecosystem and whatever development we make; it should be harmonious with this ecosystem so that life on the planet remains unaffected. We did not listen to this advice and you are probably the result of our misdeeds.Each phase of life, however pleasant or difficult, must pass and a new dawn must arrive. I sincerely hope that after causing so much harm to the mankind, you will go away by doing some good to us and make a few positive changes in our lives. Though you have built walls between us and our loved ones by isolating us, I hope that you will destroy walls of castes, religions and languages eventually as people will now realize that worth of a human life is much more than these manmade things. Capitalists are the ones who contribute immensely to our economic growth and provide millions of jobs. But they, at times, become so much profit hungry that they flout environmental norms and foster corruption to satisfy their profit motive. I hope that they will now realize that humanity is above everything and set their priorities accordingly. I hope that countries in the world will come closer in solidarity in the present situation and feuding nations will look for peaceful solutions to disputes between them rather than speaking the language of revenge and destruction. I hope that people in our country will become more hygiene conscious – not just on a personal level, but also in public places such that they maintain cleanliness everywhere. I also hope that our people will grow up with this experience and set their priorities to buy products with good quality rather than just buying cheap products, though this is not directly related to being infected by you. I expect them to value worth of manual labor and treat manual workers respectfully, ensuring their safety. This is crucial because when we interact with these workers, we are sure that we are dealing with hygienic people.Over the years, as medical science developed, our life span increased, and we started taking things for granted. Our approach to life became very rigid and unilateral. We didn’t care if life had something to talk to us…it did have a lot to tell us which is appearing now in your form and shape. It has been our belief for many centuries that we are fully evolved beings. You proved us wrong a hard way and made realize that we are still evolving, and the process of evolution is never complete for which, I thank you. We humans are innovative and intelligent. I’m sure, a vaccine on your infection will be shortly developed and your fear will be wiped out. But as you go, I only hope that you will teach us some good lessons of life that will prevent your younger siblings from entering our lives in years to come.

Is it when one rallies against a dictator or die for a country? Or is it when one saves a person's life amidst danger? I know one hero, yet she has not died for her country, nor has she saved a person in danger. You would not believe it, but she is someone with a disability. Helen Keller was born on June 27, 1980 in Tuscumbia, Alabama. She was a healthy and happy child, until at 19 months, she was struck by fever which led her to becoming deaf and blind. She learned to cope with her impairments by making signals and sounds to communicate, but soon became very frustrated. However, life for Helen has changed when her teacher, Anne Sullivan, taught her how to read in Braille (a system of raised dots representing letters which are read by feeling the dots), and how to communicate using sign language. Helen graduated from college with honors. She travelled the world and became a speaker in numerous events. She even wrote a story about her life. She was able to overcome her disabilities, achieved many things in her lifetime and inspired and helped disabled persons all over the world. Indeed, anyone can be a hero in his own way. Like Hellen Keller, one can also be a hero by inspiring other people through hard work and perseverance in the midst of difficulties. Questions: YES NO Is it based on facts? If yes, on what fact is it based on? If yes, what makes it a human-interest story? Is it a human-interest story about a person event or place? Does it highlight one aspect or significance of the story? If yes, what is the one aspect of the story that is highlighted? Does it have a heartwarming angle? If yes, what makes the story heartwarming? 2​</h2><br />

How long have you been in quarantine since the coronavirus disease pandemic was declared? What are your thoughts about being quarantined and the COVID19 itself? Here is one creative nonfiction work about it. Hello Corona (by Millind, March 24, 2020)  Hello Corona,    No, I will not call you novel or any such thing. You are a monster that has claimed thousands of lives and infected hundreds of thousands of people across the world and there is no sign of your taming down yet. But you must be the happiest creature in the world these days. After all, you have brought the entire mankind who considered themselves the most superior to all other beings, to their knees. Proud for our superior intellect, ingenuity and technological development over past so many centuries, nearly the entire world except emergency service providers has been locked at home now. We constructed large and beautiful bridges, built monumental towers, statues and sacred places for worship which people visited for centuries. All those places are deserted now.We made airplanes and travelled in each corner of the world. We developed astronomical science, built rockets and travelled in space; we even set our footprint on the moon. But now we are afraid of even stepping outside our homes and you deserve the entire (dis)credit for this. Who are you in reality, Corona… are you a message from the nature that we’ve been ignoring for several decades or maybe, centuries? Are you a blow to us from the nature against whom we tried to prove ourselves superior? We were told time and again that we are part of the entire universal ecosystem and whatever development we make; it should be harmonious with this ecosystem so that life on the planet remains unaffected. We did not listen to this advice and you are probably the result of our misdeeds.Each phase of life, however pleasant or difficult, must pass and a new dawn must arrive. I sincerely hope that after causing so much harm to the mankind, you will go away by doing some good to us and make a few positive changes in our lives. Though you have built walls between us and our loved ones by isolating us, I hope that you will destroy walls of castes, religions and languages eventually as people will now realize that worth of a human life is much more than these manmade things. Capitalists are the ones who contribute immensely to our economic growth and provide millions of jobs. But they, at times, become so much profit hungry that they flout environmental norms and foster corruption to satisfy their profit motive. I hope that they will now realize that humanity is above everything and set their priorities accordingly. I hope that countries in the world will come closer in solidarity in the present situation and feuding nations will look for peaceful solutions to disputes between them rather than speaking the language of revenge and destruction. I hope that people in our country will become more hygiene conscious – not just on a personal level, but also in public places such that they maintain cleanliness everywhere. I also hope that our people will grow up with this experience and set their priorities to buy products with good quality rather than just buying cheap products, though this is not directly related to being infected by you. I expect them to value worth of manual labor and treat manual workers respectfully, ensuring their safety. This is crucial because when we interact with these workers, we are sure that we are dealing with hygienic people.Over the years, as medical science developed, our life span increased, and we started taking things for granted. Our approach to life became very rigid and unilateral. We didn’t care if life had something to talk to us…it did have a lot to tell us which is appearing now in your form and shape. It has been our belief for many centuries that we are fully evolved beings. You proved us wrong a hard way and made realize that we are still evolving, and the process of evolution is never complete for which, I thank you. We humans are innovative and intelligent. I’m sure, a vaccine on your infection will be shortly developed and your fear will be wiped out. But as you go, I only hope that you will teach us some good lessons of life that will prevent your younger siblings from entering our lives in years to come.
