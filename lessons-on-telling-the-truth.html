                        <p>answer</p><p>Tell all the truth but tell it slant’ is quite short, but that only makes it all the more effective. Like the vast majority of Dickinson’s poems, this one was published after her death in 1886. It’s unclear what “truth” Dickinson was exploring in these lines. It could’ve been something universal, like a truth about the nature of life, God, death, etc., or something more personal. She might’ve been thinking about relationships, intimate or familial, writing, her future, or any other “truth” that one might uncover. The fact that she doesn’t define the “truth” helps as many different readers as possible approach this poem and understand it on their terms.</p><p></p><p>Dickinson begins this piece with an instruction. She informs her listener that they must “Tell all the truth,” neglecting nothing. But do so “slant.” This would mean that the truth would be delivered indirectly, or perhaps in a slightly misleading way.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#iloveyou</p><br />
