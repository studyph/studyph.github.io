Charles Darwin proved that the species develop and evolve in form throughnatural selection.4.) Evolutionary ladder illustrates that the African great apes are like the modernhumans.5.) Artifacts and fossils are important sources of information about the humanevolution.6.) Social evolution refers to the changes or development in cultures from a simpleform to a more complex form of human culture.7.) Hominids are divided into categories based on the age of artifacts and fossilsfound.8.) Australopithecus are considered as the second stage of human evolutiontogether with Sahelanthropus and Ardipithecus.9.) The 3.2 million years old Australopithecus afarensis fossil named "Lucy,"discovered in Egypt in November 1974.10.)Australopithecus disappeared in the evolutionary map million years ago andwas replaced by the Homo.11.) Homo habilis was the direct ancestor of the modern human because of itsability to produce tools.12.) Homo erectus are considered as skillful carpenters.13.) Anthropologists argued that it was the Homo sapiens who first develop anduse that skill because they have more developed brains and speech organs.14.)Cro-Magnon fossils and artifacts were first found in Europe but is believed thatit first appeared in North America and later on travelled to Europe and Asia.15.)The National Museum of the Philippines which is divided into three majorgalleries: National Museum of Modern History, National Museum ofAnthropology, and National Museum of Music and Arts.​</a>

The Paleozoic era when the trilobites and cephalopods became dominant in the ocean particularly during the Cambrian and Ordovician 6.

Homo erectus have evolved. 8.Animals in the most basic sense of the word, have evolved from prokaryotes. Fossils of early sponges have been discovered in 665 million years old rock. 9.560 million years ago, some highly significant fossils of an organism which was named Charnia were discovered. These enigmatic early animals were anchored to the sea floor where they are thought to have absorbed nutrients. 10.
