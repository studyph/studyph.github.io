                                            Activity 2. Let's Evaluate! After all, the title Kita Kita, or "I see you," is meant to be touching. It's probably meant to symbolize how Tonyo sees through Alessandra's guardedness, and how Alessandra because of her blindness, is able to love Tonyo for who he is, even if he's not conventionally good-looking. After all, isn't that all anyone wants—to be seen and loved? But because Tonyo started out as a stalker, the words "Kita kita" take on a more sinister tone (Gutierrez 2017)1.

Give one negative impression the writer has about the movie. 3 What expression/s was/were used by the writer to present both positive and negative impressions?​</a>

The varying writing styles used in each of the stories do not show that Evangelista has yet to find her own style as a writer; rather, it actually portrays her flexibility and ingenuity in choosing a style that would best fit the story she wants to tell. Many critics also disliked the use of colloquial language and deliberate wrong grammar in the dialogues in two of the stories in the collection. However, this actually makes thecharacters a lot more relatable, and it lends a certain uniqueness and freshness to the stories, making this collection a cut above the rest.QuestionWhich of the following persuasive techniques is used in the given excerpt of a critique?A. giving an exampleB. attacking an opposing viewC. defending an opposing viewD. using statistics4.

After all, isn't that all anyone wants—to be seen and loved? But because Tonyo started out as a stalker, the words "Kita kita" take on a more sinister tone (Gutierrez 2017)1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The position paper talks about <strong>whether homework should remain mandatory </strong>in the school setting.</p><p>2. According to the writer, <strong>homework should no longer be mandatory</strong> for students because it is distracting, unhealthy, too much work, and not the best way to learn. It should be optional instead.</p><p>3. I also do not think that homework should be a requirement. Homework can eat up time outside of the classroom but not teach the students anything. On top of that, teachers end up spending a long time correcting them. In my opinion, schools should instead <strong>focus on maximizing the time inside the classroom </strong>to free up the leisure time of both the teacher and the students.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Here is the definition of a position paper: https://brainly.ph/question/6638236</p><br />

                            16. 3. PassageThe critics are wrong about Lily Evangelista’s first collection of short stories entitled Breaking the Shell. The varying writing styles used in each of the stories do not show that Evangelista has yet to find her own style as a writer; rather, it actually portrays her flexibility and ingenuity in choosing a style that would best fit the story she wants to tell. Many critics also disliked the use of colloquial language and deliberate wrong grammar in the dialogues in two of the stories in the collection. However, this actually makes thecharacters a lot more relatable, and it lends a certain uniqueness and freshness to the stories, making this collection a cut above the rest.QuestionWhich of the following persuasive techniques is used in the given excerpt of a critique?A. giving an exampleB. attacking an opposing viewC. defending an opposing viewD. using statistics4.

                            24. Parts of an Exposition / Expository Writing An expository writing begins with a statement of position which states a writer's point of view. This gives us the signal that an argument is about to go next. The argument part has lots of logical facts and evidences that supports the argument. It aims to convince or persuade the readers. This writing will be closed by the restatement of position(s). Each writing should have an ending, and we end an exposition by summarizing the facts that we used to support our argument and restating or repeating our stand about our topic. This signals that our writing is about to end. Directions: Below is a sample expository text already divided into parts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Every day, COVID-19 seems to reach a new and tragic milestone.</p><p></p><p>More than 210,000 cases have now been reported to WHO, and more than 9,000 people have lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>Every loss of life is a tragedy. It’s also motivation to double down and do everything we can to stop transmission and save lives.</p><p></p><p>We also need to celebrate our successes. Yesterday, Wuhan reported no new cases for the first time since the outbreak started.</p><p></p><p>Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world, that even the most severe situation can be turned around.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we must exercise caution – the situation can reverse. But the experience of cities and countries that have pushed back this virus give hope and courage to the rest of the world.</p><p></p><p>Every day, we are learning more about this virus and the disease it causes.</p><p></p><p>One of the things we are learning is that although older people are the hardest hit, younger people are not spared.</p><p></p><p>2.) Parents Perspectives</p><p>Online learning is new, unknown and different for students, teachers and parents. It’s especially difficult for lower grade students. Parents of these young learners more often have to spend most of their time, helping their children navigate through platforms, working with them on homework and explaining the curriculum. This is true of parents who work from home, but what about those children whose parents go to work? How can these parents help their children? With this online learning, they need to find more time, concentration and focus to support their children to learn and master the subjects. Those parents who don’t have IT skills face greater problems, and need to seek help from relatives, friends, colleagues, etc. Parents and students from vulnerable communities also face difficulties, as many don’t have the means to provide their children a computer or smartphone to attend classes.</p><p></p><p>3.) As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread and people are forced to stay home, workers are losing their jobs, health care systems are being stressed, local businesses are at risk of closing permanently, and the country is bracing for recession. The crisis has laid bare the inequities and injustices that threaten people’s well-being, safety, and lives.</p><p></p><p>Amid these uncertain and challenging times, we are asking and answering: How can the nation respond in the short term to keep all people safe and the economy afloat? What policies could help all of us recover in a way that is inclusive and equitable? And how can families and communities become more resilient to global health, economic, climate, and other shocks, even as we seek to prevent them from happening again?</p><p></p><p>The Urban Institute was built for this moment. We answer tough questions with unbiased, rigorous research and evidence-based solutions. For 50 years, we have studied what it takes to strengthen social safety net programs, dismantle structural racism, protect workers and families, and build community resilience. Using advanced analytics, data science, technology, and decades of expertise, we equip changemakers with the facts and insights they need to accelerate solutions.</p><p></p><p>We will be updating this page regularly in an effort to provide clarity, insight, and evidence-based solutions as this global crisis evolved.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
