                                            I have learned in this module that an arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers where(1. sum , difference) between each number is the same or constant. Theconstant number is called the (2. term, common difference). To tell whether or nota sequence is arithmetic, we need to be able to see what is happening between each(3. term , constant). Understanding arithmetic sequences, and how to identify them is agreat way to develop critical thinking skills,For example, in this sequence, 5, 12, 19, 26... we can tell that this is an anthmeticsequences by (4. adding, subtracting) each term from the one following itMeanwhile, arithmeticterms of the sequence.

                        <p><strong>GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE</strong></p><p><strong>     Geometric sequence </strong>is a sequence of numbers where each term is after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a non zero number called the common ratio</p><strong>Geometric sequence</strong> because each phrase has a common ratio. The next term in this situation is obtained by multiplying the preceding term in the sequence by two. Or to put it another way, an=a1rn1 a n = a 1 r n - 1. This is how a geometric series looks.The six terms of the finite geometric sequence 96, -48, 24, and -12 add up to <strong>-126.</strong>The term after 4, -12, 36 in the geometric sequence is <strong>108, 324.</strong><strong>She will receive Php 204,800.00 on her 12th birthday.</strong>Karla's grandparents decided to pay for her high school education.

Theconstant number is called the (2. term, common difference). To tell whether or nota sequence is arithmetic, we need to be able to see what is happening between each(3. term , constant). Understanding arithmetic sequences, and how to identify them is agreat way to develop critical thinking skills,For example, in this sequence, 5, 12, 19, 26... we can tell that this is an anthmeticsequences by (4. adding, subtracting) each term from the one following itMeanwhile, arithmeticterms of the sequence.
