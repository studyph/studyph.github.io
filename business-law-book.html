                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ansver  </p><p>Answer from: trizianichole20
</p><p>v_f = 3.45 m/s
</p><p>
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>As we know that box was initially at rest
</p><p>
</p><p>so here work done by all forces on the box = change in its kinetic energy
</p><p>
</p><p>so we will have
</p><p>
</p><p>mg sin\theta L = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2
</p><p>
</p><p>now we have
</p><p>
</p><p>m = 10 kg
</p><p>
</p><p>\theta = 10^0
</p><p>
</p><p>L = 3.5 m
</p><p>
</p><p>so we will have
</p><p>
</p><p>10(9.81)sin10 \times 3.5 = \frac{1}{2}(10)(v_f^2 - 0)
</p><p>
</p><p>2(9.81) sin10 \times 3.5 = v_f^2
</p><p>
</p><p>so final speed is given as
</p><p>
</p><p>v_f = 3.45 m/s</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
