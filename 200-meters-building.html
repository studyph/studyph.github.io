                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanalet after time t the both stone will meet.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>distance travelled by the stone falling from the tower in time t
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>s = u t + 1/2 g t^2
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>or, s = 0 + 1/2 × 10 × t^2 = 5 t^2
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Also, distance travelled by the stone thrown up from ground in time t =
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>s = u t + 1/2 (-g) t^2
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>or, s = 50 × t - 1/2 × 10 × t^2
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>or, s = 50 t - 5 t^2
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As initially the gap between both the stone is 200 m ... so they both will together travel a distance of 200 m to meet
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>so, ( 5 t^2 ) + ( 50 t - 5 t^2 ) = 200
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>or, 50 t = 200
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>or, t = 200/50 = 4 sec
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>so, they will meet after 4 sec.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>S for falling stone = 5 × 4^2 = 80 m from the top of the tower.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>s for projected stone = 50×4 - 5×4^2

                            16. An airplane takes off 200 meters in front of a 70-meter building. Is a 18.3° angle of elevation already enough for the plane to take off and not crash into the building? Assume that the airplane flies in a straight line and the angle of elevation remains constant until the airplane flies over the building.
a.
No, a higher angle of elevation is needed. 
b.
Yes, a 18.3° angle of elevation is the minimimum the plane requires.
c.
No, a lower angle of elevation is needed. 
d.
Yes, a 18.3° angle of elevation is more than enough.</h2><br />
                        b. Yes, a 18.3° angle of elevation is the minimimum the plane requires. <br /><br />To see why, we can use trigonometry. Let x be the horizontal distance the plane travels before it clears the building. Then we have:<br /><br />tan(18.3°) = 70 / (200 + x)<br /><br />Solving for x, we get:<br /><br />x = (70 / tan(18.3°)) - 200<br /><br />Plugging in the given angle of elevation, we get:<br /><br />x ≈ 179 meters<br /><br />So as long as the plane travels at least 179 meters horizontally before it clears the building, it will not crash. Since the plane takes off 200 meters in front of the building, a 18.3° angle of elevation is sufficient.<br />
