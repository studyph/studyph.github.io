Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

                                            Normally, the basic education system in the Philippines starts every June of the year.Because of the COVID-19 pandernic, schools are closed and will open on August 24,2020 as mandated byEducation Secretary Leonor M. Briones last May 28, 2020.The Department of Education is doing its best to adjust on this new set up of learning tohappen. COVID19 caused major changes in the Philippines' education system. All of us felt these changes. Oneof these, is the online, text format messaging and drop box method of enrolment. Once classes are opened,there will be no face to face sessions between teachers and learners. This will protect us from the virusinfection. As an alternative, distance learning will be utilized. This means that homes will be the learners'classroom. This includes online, television and radio approach and modular learning.

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

Speaking before the participants from the DepEd Central, Regional, and Schools Division offices, and schools, Briones talked about their chances of winning in both international and local competitions like the Global Teacher Prize (GTP) and Metrobank Foundation. 5 “Naisip ko madami naman tayong teacher na kayang-kaya mag-qualify. Madami naman tayong teacher na magagaling, nag-i-innovate, na naghihirap, na nagsa-sacrifice, walang complaint kung saan man sila naka-assign at saka nagsisilbi sa mga komunidad. At hindi lang iyon, nag-iisip sila ng mga panibagong paraan upang ma-reach ang learners,” Briones said. Organized by the International Cooperation Office (ICO), the forum aimed to promote GTP’s Ambassador Advocacies in education and to share expertise, teaching practices, approaches, and support systems in providing education to diverse learners. The forum’s objectives were to reinforce participation to GTP and other competitions; demonstrate best teaching practices and in developing teachers’ portfolio; share innovative solutions to education challenges; and to be acquainted with GTP finalists and awardees. The GTP underscores the importance of educators and the fact that, throughout the world, their efforts deserve to be recognized and celebrated. It also seeks to acknowledge the impact of the best teachers – not only on their students but also on their communities. “We have to recognize and support excellence. We have to recognize those who do different things, those who innovate, and those who go out of the box,” Briones added. Since GTP’s inauguration in 2015, there have been only four Filipino teachers who have made it to the final top 50. Answer the following questions: 1.

                            10. write the verbs adjectives and adverbs
Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />

                            11. Normally, the basic education system in the Philippines starts every June of the year.Because of the COVID-19 pandernic, schools are closed and will open on August 24,2020 as mandated byEducation Secretary Leonor M. Briones last May 28, 2020.The Department of Education is doing its best to adjust on this new set up of learning tohappen. COVID19 caused major changes in the Philippines' education system. All of us felt these changes. Oneof these, is the online, text format messaging and drop box method of enrolment. Once classes are opened,there will be no face to face sessions between teachers and learners. This will protect us from the virusinfection. As an alternative, distance learning will be utilized. This means that homes will be the learners'classroom. This includes online, television and radio approach and modular learning. With the help of theschool, parents will be asked to assist their children while learning at home. It is clear that parents will play vitalroles this time towards their children's educational attainment with the help of the school. During these hardtimes, everybody is expected to put an extra effort on each expected task. This is a not a matter of who shoulddo it or not. It will always be a matter of helping each other to achieve one's goal.1. What is the main point expressed in the text?2.

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />

Speaking before the participants from the DepEd Central, Regional, and Schools Division offices, and schools, Briones talked about their chances of winning in both international and local competitions like the Global Teacher Prize (GTP) and Metrobank Foundation. 5 “Naisip ko madami naman tayong teacher na kayang-kaya mag-qualify. Madami naman tayong teacher na magagaling, nag-i-innovate, na naghihirap, na nagsa-sacrifice, walang complaint kung saan man sila naka-assign at saka nagsisilbi sa mga komunidad. At hindi lang iyon, nag-iisip sila ng mga panibagong paraan upang ma-reach ang learners,” Briones said. Organized by the International Cooperation Office (ICO), the forum aimed to promote GTP’s Ambassador Advocacies in education and to share expertise, teaching practices, approaches, and support systems in providing education to diverse learners. The forum’s objectives were to reinforce participation to GTP and other competitions; demonstrate best teaching practices and in developing teachers’ portfolio; share innovative solutions to education challenges; and to be acquainted with GTP finalists and awardees. The GTP underscores the importance of educators and the fact that, throughout the world, their efforts deserve to be recognized and celebrated. It also seeks to acknowledge the impact of the best teachers – not only on their students but also on their communities. “We have to recognize and support excellence. We have to recognize those who do different things, those who innovate, and those who go out of the box,” Briones added. Since GTP’s inauguration in 2015, there have been only four Filipino teachers who have made it to the final top 50. Answer the following questions: 1.

Briones last May 28, 2020.The Department of Education is doing its best to adjust on this new setup of learning to happen. COVID-19 caused major changes in the Philippineseducation system. All of us felt these changes. One of these, is the online, text format messaging anddrop box method of enrolment.Once classes are opened, there will be no face to face sessions between teachers and learners.This will protect us from the virus infection. As an alternative, distance learning will be utilized. Thismeans that homes will be the learners' classroom. This includes online, television and radio approachand modular leaming. With the help of the school, parents will be asked to assist their children whileleaming at home. It is clear that parents will play vital roles this time towards their children's educationalattainment with the help of the school.During these hard times, everybody is expected to put an extra effort on each expected task.
