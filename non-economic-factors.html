                                            Housing loans are granted to PAG-IBIG members at very low interest rates to help them build and own-their own homes. The loan is expected to be paid on a monthly basis within a certain period of time. Despite the liberal repayment scheme, repayment rate has been consistently low. Records show a delinquency rate about 30%. Arrears average at Php 80,000 and many properties have been foreclosed as documented by notices of foreclosure. PAG-IBIG members' failure to pay their obligations has been attributed to many factors, like lack of awareness among borrowers of the consequences of non-payment, a negative attitude towards government loans, or shortage of cash because of other financial need and others. Two local studies on loan payment behaviors of credit cooperative members showed that social and economic factors influence repayment. The studies, however, did not touch on knowledge and attitudes towards loan repayment. Most of the studies reviewed deal with credit coop loans and crop loans. Studies on housing loans are limited. 1. What can be the possible research question? 2. What is the problem situation? Show evidences. 3. What should be the situation? 4.

                            27. Housing loans are granted to PAG-IBIG members at very low interest rates to help them build and own-their own homes. The loan is expected to be paid on a monthly basis within a certain period of time. Despite the liberal repayment scheme, repayment rate has been consistently low. Records show a delinquency rate about 30%. Arrears average at Php 80,000 and many properties have been foreclosed as documented by notices of foreclosure. PAG-IBIG members' failure to pay their obligations has been attributed to many factors, like lack of awareness among borrowers of the consequences of non-payment, a negative attitude towards government loans, or shortage of cash because of other financial need and others. Two local studies on loan payment behaviors of credit cooperative members showed that social and economic factors influence repayment. The studies, however, did not touch on knowledge and attitudes towards loan repayment. Most of the studies reviewed deal with credit coop loans and crop loans. Studies on housing loans are limited. 1. What can be the possible research question? 2. What is the problem situation? Show evidences. 3. What should be the situation? 4.

The issue on equality in the past highlighted racial discrimination. Hence, colored races received unfair treatment. Disrespect on their identity was very evident. 2. Poverty was a determining factor between the whites and the blacks. For that reason, the whites were deemed rich and dominant. This intensified the racial inequality and disparity between them. 3. The Africans cried for freedom from oppression and discrimination. In fact, Nelson Mandela fought for this cause to stop Apartheid and redeem the human rights for his fellowmen. 4. Economic activities for the non-whites were also restricted. If they would go to the areas of the whites, they were required to bring papers that allow them to enter such prohibited areas. 5. The Black Africans received more social injustices. They were forced to live in towns outside cities where whites owned the land. Furthermore, there was even unequal access to education.​</h2><br />
