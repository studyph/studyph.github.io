                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research Title: Understanding the Factors Influencing Female Students' Interest and Performance in STEM: A Mixed-Methods Study.</p><p></p><p>Introduction and Rationale:</p><p></p><p>STEM education, which prepares students for employment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, has grown in importance in today's culture. However, research has revealed that there is a considerable gender gap in STEM professions, with women underrepresented. This gender disparity has been blamed on a number of issues, including gender stereotypes, a lack of role models, and unconscious bias in the classroom. The goal of this research is to look at what factors influence female students' interest and performance in STEM disciplines. We can create methods and interventions to improve female involvement and success in STEM disciplines by acquiring a greater understanding of these characteristics. A mixed-methods approach will be used in this study, which will include surveys and interviews with female STEM students and their teachers. The collected data will be examined in order to uncover common themes and patterns that emerge, as well as to develop suggestions for best practices in STEM education for girls. This study is significant because it tackles an essential issue in STEM education and has the potential to improve policies and practices aimed at increasing female involvement and performance in STEM disciplines.</p><p></p><p>I apologize I do not know your track/strand, thus I chose STEM as a research topic! ^^</p><p></p><p></p><br />
