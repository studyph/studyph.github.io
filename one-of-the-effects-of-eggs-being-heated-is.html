_____11. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation occurs when water on Earth’s surface turns into water vapor in our atmosphere. Warm water rises through Earth’s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the cool air of the atmosphere causes the water vapor to turn back into water creating clouds. This process 
is called condensation. When a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain – also known as precipitation. Rain then fill the lakes and streams, and the process starts all over again. 
_____12. Typhoons and tropical Storms bring wind and rain. They may be sometime very strong that can destroy properties. Being prepared is essential to survival. First, listen to the radio or TV for information and keep your weather radio handy (if available). Next, secure your home. Close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors. Then, turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Lastly, avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies. 
_____13. Making lemonade is just an easy thing to do. First, slice the lemon in half and squeeze it to get the juice of it. Next, put some water in a pitcher and add the lemon juice to the water.

_____14. Frogs undergo some stages before they become adult frogs. First, the mother frog lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like a frog but it has a tail. This is called a froglet. Finally, the froglet loose its tail. Now, It’s a frog. 
_____15. Some objects may sink and other just float. It depends on the density of the object. An object is made of substances that are themselves made up of molecules. Density is a measure of both how massive those molecules are, and how closely packed together they are. If the object's total density is greater than that of water, it sinks, but if it is less, it floats. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”.

The heat coming from your stove denatures the protein by disrupting some of its bonds that held the molecule into shape. In the case of hard-boiled eggs, the proteins clump together and solidify, causing the egg white and yolk to harden.<p></p><br />

_____11. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation occurs when water on Earth’s surface turns into water vapor in our atmosphere. Warm water rises through Earth’s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the cool air of the atmosphere causes the water vapor to turn back into water creating clouds. This process 
is called condensation. When a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain – also known as precipitation. Rain then fill the lakes and streams, and the process starts all over again. 
_____12. Typhoons and tropical Storms bring wind and rain. They may be sometime very strong that can destroy properties. Being prepared is essential to survival. First, listen to the radio or TV for information and keep your weather radio handy (if available). Next, secure your home. Close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors. Then, turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Lastly, avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies. 
_____13. Making lemonade is just an easy thing to do. First, slice the lemon in half and squeeze it to get the juice of it. Next, put some water in a pitcher and add the lemon juice to the water. Then, add some sugar and stir it. Finally, pour it in a cup and add a straw if you wish to use it. Now, enjoy drinking your lemonade juice. 
_____14. Frogs undergo some stages before they become adult frogs. First, the mother frog lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like a frog but it has a tail. This is called a froglet. Finally, the froglet loose its tail. Now, It’s a frog. 
_____15. Some objects may sink and other just float. It depends on the density of the object. An object is made of substances that are themselves made up of molecules. Density is a measure of both how massive those molecules are, and how closely packed together they are. If the object's total density is greater than that of water, it sinks, but if it is less, it floats. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”.
