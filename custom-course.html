                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Outsourced call centers, or contact centers, are groups of individuals who handle a large volume of calls sent to a company. Call center or contact center staff, often referred to as call center agents, telemarketers, customer service representatives (CSR), or customer support, receive inbound calls in response to customer queries and make outbound calls as telemarketers on behalf of a telemarketing company. Additionally, they may be responsible for directory assistance or generating leads for finance and mortgaging companies that come from foreign-based parent companies.</p><p></p><p>Call centers are the most common form of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies from the Philippines. Although there are pros and cons to outsourcing call center agents, there are numerous benefits for small and medium scale businesses that can help grow the business and achieve long and short-term goals. Developing countries such as India and countries in South America are popular destinations for low-cost outsourcing, but many countries still choose the Philippines.</p><br />
