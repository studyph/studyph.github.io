                                            PHAETHON was a youthful son of Helios who begged his father let him drive thechariot of the sun. The god reluctantly conceded to the boy's wishes and handed himthe reigns. But his inexperience proved fatal, for Phaethon quickly lost control of theimmortal steeds and the sun-chariot veered out of control setting the earth ablaze. Theplains of Africa were scorched to desert and men charred black. Zeus, appalled by thedestruction, smote the boy with a thunderbolt, hurling his flaming body into the watersof the River Eridanos. Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, gathered on the banks and intheir mourning were transformed into amber-teared poplar trees.After his death Phaethon was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Auriga("the Charioteer"), or else transformed into the god of the star which the Greeksnamed Phaeth on--the planet Jupiter or SaturnThe name Phaethon means "the shining" or "radiant one from the Greekverb phaethó "to shine."FAMILY OF PHAETHONPARENTS(1.1) HELIOS(1.2) HELIOS &amp; KLYMENE(1.31 KLYMENOS &amp; MEROPE(PHAETHON - Son of the Sun-God of Greek Mythology 2017)Now answer the questions for processing!1.

                                            Who is the speaker of the poem Good Timber
The tree that never had to fight
 For sun and sky and air and light,
But stood out in the open plain
 And always got its share of rain,
Never became a forest king
 But lived and died a scrubby thing.
The man who never had to toil
 To gain and farm his patch of soil,
Who never had to win his share
 Of sun and sky and light and air,
Never became a manly man
 But lived and died as he began.
Good timber does not grow with ease,
 The stronger wind, the stronger trees,
The further sky, the greater length,
 The more the storm, the more the strength.
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
 In trees and men good timbers grow.
Where thickest lies the forest growth
 We find the patriarchs of both.
And they hold counsel with the stars
 Whose broken branches show the scars
Of many winds and much of strife.
 This is the common law of life.</a>

                            8. PHAETHON was a youthful son of Helios who begged his father let him drive thechariot of the sun. The god reluctantly conceded to the boy's wishes and handed himthe reigns. But his inexperience proved fatal, for Phaethon quickly lost control of theimmortal steeds and the sun-chariot veered out of control setting the earth ablaze. Theplains of Africa were scorched to desert and men charred black. Zeus, appalled by thedestruction, smote the boy with a thunderbolt, hurling his flaming body into the watersof the River Eridanos. Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, gathered on the banks and intheir mourning were transformed into amber-teared poplar trees.After his death Phaethon was placed amongst the stars as the constellation Auriga("the Charioteer"), or else transformed into the god of the star which the Greeksnamed Phaeth on--the planet Jupiter or SaturnThe name Phaethon means "the shining" or "radiant one from the Greekverb phaethó "to shine."FAMILY OF PHAETHONPARENTS(1.1) HELIOS(1.2) HELIOS &amp; KLYMENE(1.31 KLYMENOS &amp; MEROPE(PHAETHON - Son of the Sun-God of Greek Mythology 2017)Now answer the questions for processing!1.

                            12. Who is the speaker of the poem Good Timber
The tree that never had to fight
 For sun and sky and air and light,
But stood out in the open plain
 And always got its share of rain,
Never became a forest king
 But lived and died a scrubby thing.
The man who never had to toil
 To gain and farm his patch of soil,
Who never had to win his share
 Of sun and sky and light and air,
Never became a manly man
 But lived and died as he began.
Good timber does not grow with ease,
 The stronger wind, the stronger trees,
The further sky, the greater length,
 The more the storm, the more the strength.
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
 In trees and men good timbers grow.
Where thickest lies the forest growth
 We find the patriarchs of both.
And they hold counsel with the stars
 Whose broken branches show the scars
Of many winds and much of strife.
 This is the common law of life.</h2><br />
