From the given statements, write “MINE” if it represents yourself otherwise write “NOPE” on the blank provided. ________1. A beautiful day may sometimes turn out to be a disaster. (What could be bigger, better, and bolder unsinkable sea vessel yet within week turning everything into a disaster?)___2. Tragedy and disaster may in time fuel great achievement. (The wreck of Dona Paz marked a great lesson in the history.) ________3. There may be icebergs ahead called life’s obstacles. (Do you have a good lookout or are you fast asleep in steerage?) ________4. Control is sometimes an illusion. (If you ended up on the deck of the Dona Paz, was there much you could do to control your fate?) ________5. Live life to the fullest. (Is there anyone boarded the Dona Paz contemplated what lay ahead?) ________6. Make every moment counts. (How will you judge your life accountabilities during your last defining moment of life?) ________7. It pays to be upwardly mobile. (Money can’t buy your life, how about your class and position, will it save you?) ________8. Shout loudly and maybe the world will listen. (Too many people asking for help out there, are you the right person to help? ________9. If in doubt, be reasonable. (Who could figure out what happened, why, and how much they tried to avoid it?) ________10. Nothing lasts forever. (After two consecutive wrecks of Dona Paz in the midst of the sea, without happening it, do you think the ship would still exist today?)​</a>

The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</a>

                            27. pahelp namn Po pagawan Ng plotA bright red explosion sends a big impact and damages in the surface towards the city of Mystique. The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The study of continuity and change over time; the study of the past</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. You may not have thought much about it, but the people who write your history text books do the same kind of thinking that you just did. They make decisions about what kind of stuff to include in the book and leave out. In other words, they decide what counts as history.</p><br />

Who is the scientist from England invented the AnalyticalEngine? 4. On what year did a French Scientist invested an adding machine? 5. What do you the calculating device invented by John Napier of England?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The first calculating machine used for counting is known as the abacus, which has been used for thousands of years in various cultures around the world.The generation of computer devices that have artificial intelligence is known as the 5th generation. These devices were developed in the 1980s and use advanced programming techniques and algorithms to simulate human-like intelligence and decision-making.The scientist from England who invented the Analytical Engine is Charles Babbage, who is often referred to as the "father of the computer". Babbage developed the concept of a programmable computer in the 19th century, but his design was never completed during his lifetime.A French scientist named Blaise Pascal invented an adding machine called the Pascaline in 1642. The machine was designed to perform simple arithmetic calculations, such as addition and subtraction, and used a series of gears and wheels to compute the results.The calculating device invented by John Napier of England is called the Napier's bones, which is a set of numbered rods that can be used to perform multiplication and division by hand. The device was invented in the 17th century and was a precursor to modern mechanical calculators.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Please leave a like/heart.

What is the standard deviation for a sample of 289 vote counts?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. To find the standard deviation (s) for a sample of 40,000 observations, we can use the formula:</p><p>s = σ / sqrt(n)</p><p></p><p>where σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, and sqrt represents the square root function.</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values, we get:</p><p></p><p>s = 2.75 / sqrt(40,000)</p><p>s = 0.01375</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the standard deviation for a sample of 40,000 observations is 0.01375.</p><p></p><p>2. To find the standard deviation (s) for a sample of 4 different Grade 11 Philippine history books, we can use the formula:</p><p>s = σ / sqrt(n)</p><p></p><p>where σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, and sqrt represents the square root function.</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values, we get:</p><p></p><p>s = 16.88 / sqrt(4)</p><p>s = 8.44</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the standard deviation for a sample of 4 different Grade 11 Philippine history books is 8.44.</p><p></p><p>3. To find the standard deviation (s) for a sample of 400 senior high students, we can use the formula:</p><p>s = σ / sqrt(n)</p><p></p><p>where σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, and sqrt represents the square root function.</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values, we get:</p><p></p><p>s = 16 / sqrt(400)</p><p>s = 0.8</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the standard deviation for a sample of 400 senior high students is 0.8.</p><p></p><p>4. To find the standard deviation (s) for a sample of 289 vote counts, we can use the formula:</p><p>s = σ / sqrt(n)</p><p></p><p>where σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, and sqrt represents the square root function.</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values, we get:</p><p></p><p>s = 1,265 / sqrt(289)</p><p>s = 70.45</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the standard deviation for a sample of 289 vote counts is 70.45.</p><p></p><br />
