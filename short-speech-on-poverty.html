This issue is poverty in the Philippines. Poverty is a very big issue especially in the Philippines because it affects people just like you and me, people who have dreams and goals but could never imagine of achieving them.  In the Philippines more than 30% of people fall below the poverty line and about 12%  are in extreme poverty meaning they use less than 2 to survive dollars a day. I want everyone here to close their eyes for a moment and try to imagine what I’m about to tell you. Imagine yourself living next to a garbage dump, waking up every morning knowing that there is nothing you can do with your life but try to survive, imagine not being able to eat breakfast and lunch but only eating one small</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>palitan mo nalang nang name mo</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>“Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p>poverty essay</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><br />

                            4. what are the data presented in the speech of poverty in the philippines?​</h2><br />
                        Answer:1. I observe that the speech is all about on how the silence transform to a action and how to speak the truth without fear.2. Speeches typically serve four general purposes: to inform, persuade, instruct, or entertain. By taking a step back to examine the general purpose of the speech, a speaker reinforces his or her thoughts and ideas by making sure that everything presented to argue your case aligns to that general purpose.3. For me like it's only my opinion, that I'm More persuaded than informed because persuaded is that you see the situation about the poverty of the Philippines yourself but when you say informed, it is the information that somebody else told you about that can also be their own opinions on the poverty of the Philippines or from other websites on the internet. So I am very much persuaded that Philippines is still a poor country due to the government lack of decision and of support to the poor families4. The word "this" can be used for a variety of purposes and contexts. Basically, it can be classified as an adjective, a definite article, a pronoun, or an adverb depending on how it is used.Explanation:√<strong>Correct me if I'm wrong</strong>×Hate me√Keep Learning<strong>@happychloe85 Original Answer</strong><br />

We need a combination of responsible policies and responsible behavior.</p><p></p><p>Second, although there are many things that might be done to reduce poverty in the U.S., I want to argue for a focus on three priorities: getting a good education, not having children before you marry, and working full-time. Government should expect people to make real efforts to comply with each of these norms. When they do, then government should reward such behavior by making sure that those who play by the rules will not be poor. The analysis we have done at Brookings shows that individuals who play by these rules are much less likely to be poor than those who don’t.</p><p></p><p>Third, one of the most effective policies we could put in place to ensure that everyone gets a good education would be to provide very high-quality early education to all children from low-income families. Many people believe that education in the preschool years only affects young children. In fact, the evidence from both neuroscience and from carefully done program evaluations shows that preschool experiences have long-lasting effects and may be the most cost-effective way to insure that more children are successful in the K-12 years, graduate from high school, go on to college, and earn more as adults. The federal government could further this goal by providing matching funding to states that are willing to invest in high-quality early education for those living in low-income neighborhoods, starting in the first year of life.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, too many of our teens and young adults are having children before they are married and before they are ready to be good parents. In my view, the solution to this problem resides as much in the larger culture-in what parents, the media, faith communities and key adults say and do-as it does in any shift in government policy per se. However, government can help by providing resources to those fighting this battle in the nongovernmental sector, by insuring that its own policies do not inadvertently encourage childbearing outside of marriage, and by supporting programs that have had some success in reducing early, out-of-wedlock childbearing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, encouraging and rewarding work is also very important. I support the idea of work requirements in welfare, and perhaps in other programs as well, but I fear that the kind of increased employment we’ve seen among welfare mothers will be a Pyrrhic victory if we don’t find ways to provide more assistance in the form of a higher minimum wage, a more generous EITC, and additional child care and health care assistance. In my testimony today-at the suggestion of your staff-I will focus especially on preschool education and on the need to decrease childbearing outside of marriage and increase the share of children growing up in two-parent, married families. But I have written elsewhere about the importance of providing additional work supports for low-income working families.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>PLS BRAINLLIEST</strong></p><br />

                        <p>People experience <strong>hunger because of poverty</strong>. An <strong>issue of every third world country </strong>that is so hard to resolve. Is it the government’s fault why a lot of people in our country experience this? It could be one of the reasons. When there’s corruption, there’s poverty. How expensive it is to provide to the poorest people? </p><p>In reality, if you are rich, you could be richer. If you work for the rich, you could be their worker for a lifetime. Sad, because it seems like the society is not allowing change and growth to those who are worth it. Filipinos are hardworking. It is our innate personality. However, opportunities are not given to all. Not everyone can attain the highest education. Remote areas are lacking of schools and teachers. The local government must pursue that all children must experience education because it is a necessity. </p><p><strong>Poverty is experienced globally</strong>. It is said that 1 billion children worldwide are living in poverty, and according to <strong>UNICEF</strong>, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty. Filipinos contribute to that number. Children die because of extreme <strong>hunger, malnutrition or dehydration</strong> because some couldn’t even afford to drink clean water. I really hope the government could really help these people by giving them sources of income, like in agriculture or fishery. I also thought that if the government could do something about the infrastructures and electricity of these remotes areas so that there will be more educators and doctors who could visit their places. All of us should work together in order to achieve a proper living. A proper living where every one in the family could eat three times a day, a house that could protect them day and night, an education for the young ones, and accessible health centers. </p><p>It sounded easy, but it really is so hard to do. Because if it was easy, our country will not be experiencing this issue anymore. I just hope everyone can be given a chance to live in this world where everyone would feel contented.</p><p>Read more about poverty and hunger:</p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1350833</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/473646</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/464802</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to talk to you about poverty and its impact on society.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a significant issue that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as the state of being extremely poor, characterized by a lack of basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing.</p><p></p><p>Poverty not only affects individuals but also entire communities and societies. It leads to poor health, lack of education, and limited opportunities. Children growing up in poverty are more likely to drop out of school and less likely to succeed in life. Adults living in poverty are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions and have limited access to healthcare.</p><p></p><p>Poverty also contributes to crime, violence, and social unrest. People living in poverty are more likely to turn to criminal activity as a means of survival. This not only harms the individuals involved but also the communities they live in.</p><p></p><p>However, poverty is not an unsolvable problem. There are several ways to address and reduce poverty, such as through economic growth, job creation, and social welfare programs. Investing in education and job training can also provide individuals with the skills and resources they need to break the cycle of poverty.</p><p></p><p>But it's not just the government's responsibility, we all have a role to play in addressing poverty. We can support organizations and charities that provide assistance to those in need, we can volunteer our time and resources, and we can advocate for policies that address poverty.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a significant issue that affects millions of people around the world, and it is important that we all work together to address it. We can do this by supporting those in need, investing in education and job training, and advocating for policies that address poverty. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            24. 300 word speech about "poverty is not due to overpopulation but because of inequality and corruption"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>It is a common misconception that poverty is solely caused by overpopulation. However, the reality is far from it. Poverty is primarily a result of inequality and corruption, and not due to the number of people living in a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Inequality is a fundamental issue that results in a small group of people having the majority of resources and wealth, while the vast majority of people have little to no access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This inequality is perpetuated by systemic issues such as unequal distribution of resources, biased economic policies, and inadequate social safety nets. The wealthy have access to quality education and job opportunities while the poor are denied access to these essential tools. As a result, the cycle of poverty continues.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, corruption also plays a significant role in poverty. When people in power use their position to gain wealth and power for themselves, they are actively taking resources away from those in need. Corruption also leads to a lack of transparency and accountability, which means that resources meant to help the poor are often misused or stolen, leaving those in need without any aid.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that overpopulation is not the main cause of poverty. While population growth can lead to increased strain on resources, it is not the root cause of poverty. Countries with high population densities such as Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong have managed to develop successful economies and provide their citizens with a high standard of living.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to overpopulation. It is caused by inequality and corruption, which perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty. To eradicate poverty, we need to address these systemic issues and promote equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. We must also fight corruption and ensure that resources meant for the poor are not misused or stolen. It is time for us to come together and work towards a future where poverty is no longer a reality. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good Morning everyone present here. My name is _________. My topic for the day is Speech on Poverty. It is a great honor for me to take this chance in helping us engage in a conversation about a subject that has been the source of many problems in the world. It is a problem that continues to affect a big part of the world population today. I want us to talk about poverty.
</p><p>
</p><p>Poverty is a state of scarcity, the lack of material possessions to such an extent that people have difficulties in providing for their basic needs. It touches on many aspects of human life including economic, political, and social elements. The reason why I need us to look into this topic is that poverty has assumed a dynamic character, changing with patterns of consumption, progress in technology, as well as social behavior.  </p><p>
</p><p>According to Robert McNamara, a former World Bank president, extreme poverty is limited by illiteracy, malnutrition, disease and high infant mortality rate, squalid conditions of living, and low life expectancy. Previously, people were described as living in absolute poverty if they survived on less than US$ 1 per day. This has been revised over the years and currently starts at less than US$ 1.25 per person per day. Those who live on less than 2 dollars per day are in moderate hardship. Measurement of relative poverty reflects the proportion of a population that earns less than a fixed proportion of median income in an economy. It is a better measure of poorness than an absolute one since it is not under the influence of exchange rates.  </p><p>
</p><p>To elaborate further on my speech on Poverty. We shall look at the other aspects of poverty and how poverty acts as a major deterrent in face of growth and progress</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>hope it helps                                                                 copy and paste</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>                                         good luck:&gt;</strong></p><br />
