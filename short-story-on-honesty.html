                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A successful business man was growing old and knew it was time to choose a successor to take over the business.</p><p></p><p>Instead of choosing one of his Directors or his children, he decided to do something different. He called all the young executives in his company together.</p><p></p><p>He said, “It is time for me to step down and choose the next CEO. I have decided to choose one of you.”</p><p></p><p>The young executives were shocked, but the boss continued. “I am going to give each one of you a SEED today – one very special SEED. I want you to plant the seed, water it, and come back here one year from today with what you have grown from the seed I have given you. I will then judge the plants that you bring, and the one I choose will be the next CEO.”</p><p></p><p>One man, named Jim, was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed. He went home and excitedly, told his wife the story. She helped him get a pot, soil and compost and he planted the seed.</p><p></p><p>Everyday, he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After about three weeks, some of the other executives began to talk about their seeds and the plants that were beginning to grow.</p><p></p><p>Jim kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew. Three weeks, four weeks, five weeks went by, still nothing. By now, others were talking about their plants, but Jim didn’t have a plant and he felt like a failure.</p><p></p><p>Six months went by — still nothing in Jim’s pot. He just knew he had killed his seed. Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had nothing. Jim didn’t say anything to his colleagues, however… He just kept watering and fertilizing the soil – He so wanted the seed to grow.</p><p></p><p>A year finally went by and all the young executives of the company brought their plants to the CEO for inspection.</p><p></p><p>Jim told his wife that he wasn’t going to take an empty pot. But she asked him to be honest about what happened. Jim felt sick to his stomach, it was going to be the most embarrassing moment of his life, but he knew his wife was right.</p><p></p><p>He took his empty pot to the board room. When Jim arrived, he was amazed at the variety of plants grown by the other executives. They were beautiful — in all shapes and sizes.</p><p></p><p>Jim put his empty pot on the floor and many of his colleagues laughed, a few felt sorry for him!</p><p></p><p>When the CEO arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted his young executives.</p><p></p><p>Jim just tried to hide in the back. “My, what great plants, trees, and flowers you have grown,” said the CEO. “Today one of you will be appointed the next CEO!”</p><p></p><p>All of a sudden, the CEO spotted Jim at the back of the room with his empty pot. He ordered the Financial Director to bring him to the front.</p><p></p><p>Jim was terrified. He thought, “The CEO knows I’m a failure! Maybe he will have me fired!”</p><p></p><p>When Jim got to the front, the CEO asked him what had happened to his seed – Jim told him the story.</p><p></p><p>The CEO asked everyone to sit down except Jim. He looked at Jim, and then announced to the young executives, “Behold your next Chief Executive Officer! His name is Jim!”</p><p></p><p>Jim couldn’t believe it. Jim couldn’t even grow his seed.</p><p></p><p>“How could he be the new CEO?” the others said.</p><p></p><p>Then the CEO said, “One year ago today, I gave everyone in this room a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds; they were dead – it was not possible for them to grow. All of you, except Jim, have brought me trees and plants and flowers. When you found that the seed would not grow, you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. Jim was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it. Therefore, he is the one who will be the new Chief Executive Officer!”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>heheh</strong><strong>ehe</strong><strong> </strong><strong>basahin</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Integrity is defined as ‘the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles’.  Integrity is about making good choices. It is doing the right things for the right reason.  It is about being honest with yourself and honest with others.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes you may not be sure what the right thing to do is in a situation.  When this happens, you can ask yourself a few simple questions to come up with the right answer, such as:  “How will this decision affect others? Am I considering how this will make other people feel? Will I be proud to tell my parents or teacher that I did this?</p><p></p><p>Doing the right thing is an incredibly important thing. It will affect your friendships, your family, your community and your future. Little choices that we make can have big consequences on ourselves and others.</p><p></p><p>Below are some inspirational quotes that help explain the importance of integrity, honesty and doing the right thing.</p><p></p><p>“Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.” – Mark Twain</p><p>“The time is always right to do what is right.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>“The right to do something does not mean that doing it is right.” – William Safire</p><p>“Character is doing the right thing when nobody’s looking.” – J.C. Watts</p><p>“If you have integrity, nothing else matters.  If you don’t have integrity, nothing else matters.” – Alan Simpson</p><p>“When I do good, I feel good.  When I do bad, I feel bad.” – Abraham Lincoln</p><p>“Every time I’ve done something that doesn’t feel right, it’s ended up not being right.” – Mario Cuomo</p><p>“To know what is right and not do it is the worst cowardice.” – Confucius</p><p>“You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.” – Malcolm Forbes</p><p>“Be true to your work, your word, and your friend.” -Henry David Thoreau</p><p>“No legacy is so rich as honesty.” – William Shakespeare</p><p>“Be always sure you’re right, then go ahead.” – Davy Crocket</p><p>“Honesty is the best policy. If I lose mine honor, I lose myself.” -William Shakespeare</p><p>“Anyone who doesn’t take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.” -Albert Einstein</p><p>“A half truth is a whole lie.” -Yiddish Proverb</p><p>Here is a great video that shows integrity and honesty in action:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are two other videos that show great examples of honesty and integrity.</p><p></p><p>And here is a real life story about Joey Prusak, a teenager who demonstrates great honesty, integrity and caring:</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Hopeitshrlp</p><p></p><br />

His simple reply was: “When my wife was still my girlfriend, she answered all my questions. Now that she is my wife, she questions all my answers.”</p><p></p><p>In today’s gospel (Mk. 9, 30-37), Jesus asked His disciples a question that they did not, or perhaps could not, answer. Why? Because, to their shame, they were discussing who among them was the greatest. The truth of the matter is that the power game is not over, and a lot of people are still very much hooked to it.</p><p></p><p>The evil one knows that humility is the key to holiness and true greatness. That is why he specializes in using pride, his greatest instrument for the destruction and perdition of persons. The temptations connected to pride are strong, and often they are effective because they are subtle and hidden. We all must be very honest and open. Yes, honesty is the first cousin of humility.</p><p></p><p></p><p>[tex]\huge\textsf{EnjoyReading!}[/tex]</p><p>source: <strong>Bible </strong>(online)</p><p>search: inquirer.net (humility and honesty) to continue reading the story!</p><br />

                        <strong>Question: Write a story that contains about how you can become honest.</strong>--------------{ANSWER}----------------------------------------TITLE: The two sisters called Sarah and Ella.Beginning part<p>Once upon a time, there were two girls. Sarah and Ella. Both of them were sisters, and they loved each other, they cared for each other, they did everything that a sibling can do. But one day, something happened that changed their life forever. Ella was walking around when she saw her sister, Sarah, bullying a child. In Ella's mind, she thought: "What? Is that Sarah? Why is she bullying that child? I must go and check!". Ella did check her sister, but unfortunately, Sarah was just finished bullying the child.</p>Middle part<p>Ella confronted her sister and Sarah was shocked. Sarah said: "Hey! uhh... Ella... it's not what it looks like... I just wanted candy..." Ella was mad at Sarah because she was bullying a helpless child. Ella said: "I am going to tell <strong>mom</strong> about this." Sarah was frightened, but she needed a plan about this. Sarah stopped Ella and said: "Ella if you don't tell mom about this, I'll give you all the candy I got.". Ella didn't want Sarah's dishonest candy, so she still strived to tell their mom about this situation. Ella was running to the house while Sarah was behind. Ella pushed the door open and let out a big bang. The mom was confused why Ella was so furious. Then, Ella said about the situation. "Mom! Sarah was bullying a random child because Sarah wanted candy! But she took it all from the kid!" Ella said. "No mom! This isn't true!" said Sarah. The mom was confused. "Mom, Ella was the one who took the candy!" "No mom! Sarah did!" <strong>"ENOUGH!"</strong> </p><strong>Ending part</strong><p>A little child was behind the mom, Sarah, and Ella. <strong>"Ella is telling the truth!"</strong> Said the little child. "Sarah wanted all of my candy, so she bullied me!" Also said the little child. The mom was furious, and told both Ella and Sarah, "Ella, is this all true?!" The mom said. "Yes, mother. It is true. She wanted to give me "her" candy if I didn't talk about this." Said Ella. "SARAH, IS THIS ALL TRUE?" "M-mom... Y-yes..." Said Sarah. The mom took a deep breath and sighed. "Well, I do thank you for your honesty Sarah, but this is unacceptable!" Sarah said: "Yes mom, I'm very sorry." The mom said: "Don't say sorry to me, say sorry to the child!" Sarah turned to the little child and apologized for her actions. </p>~THE END~----------------------------------------------------------------------~Which part of your story highlighted the value of honesty?~<p>The ending part was the best part in my story. It showed that Sarah was facing a bad way, so she took the best way. She apologized and was honest. Even if you are a bad person, look to the bright side, and always become honest, even if something bad will happen. Because as they always say... <strong>"Honesty is the best policy!"</strong></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------~~EXPLANATION~~I really hope this helped you, have a nice and wonderful day or night, and stay safe! And always remember that honesty is the best policy!#CaringOnLearningHappy learning! (ノ^_^)ノ<p></p><br />
