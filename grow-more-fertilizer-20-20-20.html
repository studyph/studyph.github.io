Direct-seeding is a method of planting seeds directly into the ground or plot. 13. Seed germination is the development or growth of a seed into a young plant that influence harvest and the quality of tree products. 14. Transplanting is the process where seedling is transferred from the seed box or other containers to the ground or plot for growth, development, and production. 15. Trees and fruit-bearing trees need a wider space for planting to grow and be productive 16. A good season in planting is the rainy season where there is abundance of water. 17. Organic fertilizer is safer and more economical to use. 18. Inorganic fertilizer or commercial fertilizer should be regulated because overuse of it can damage the soil 19. In hardening, the process can be done in 10 to 20 days before transplanting. 20. The kind of soil as well as the amount of sunlight that the trees can have should not be considered before planting.​</p>
