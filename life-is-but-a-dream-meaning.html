Motion is a phenomenon that is very common in our daily life like how car travel moves, the air we breathe, the blood in our veins, and even how our minds work or think is in motion. In our Dreams, our mind tends to see our inspiring insights in life become possible. That capacity or ability to direct the behavior to our dreams is known as power of the mind which probably tells you that you need to sort out your life routine. Inspiring your minds with your dreams to put it in action is known as energy. Applying these contexts of Laws of Motion, Power and Energy will surely make your dreams in reality.

Dreams are common to us all. Dreams are special as well. We probably keep ourselves many of our dreams for fear of ridicule or misunderstanding. Oftentimes, we may have selectively shared our dreams, those w figured out would get approval. The ones closest and dearest to us, the one we feel most vulnerable about, we may choose to treasure to our hearts only, sometimes thinking, “If only you know”, sometimes wondering if we are being silly. We believe that our dreams are spirit filled. They are gifts to encourage us. Like a ship at the sea needing a “heading” to move forward, our dreams give direction to our lives. Our frustration maybe that we can’t realize a dream without many steps and much time. But life is a process of steps. Success in anything comes inch by inch, stroke by stroke and step by step.
26. What value does the writer emphasize?
a. Having goals in life
b. Being overly ambitious
c. Being overly competitive
d. All of these
27. To what did the writer compare our dreams?
a. a silly gift
b. a ship at sea
c. a spirit

29. “The dreams we feel most vulnerable about, we may choose to treasure to our hearts only.” What does this line mean?
a. We don’t want other people to discover our real dreams.
b. We don’t share our real dreams to other people for the fear of being judged as ambitious.
c. we don’t let others discover our dreams because we ourselves believe they are impossible to achieve.
d. All of the above</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>John Livingston Seagull is often referred to as a "fable." A fable is a short story that conveys a moral and uses some key features. The most important feature of a fable is the moral of the story. In John Livingston Seagull, the moral is to go against the crowd and to follow your own desires despite what others think.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Typically, characters are animals in fables, whose characteristics and behaviors are then used by the author to tell us something about human nature. For example, Jonathan's desire to fly rather than eat represents the human desire to be individualistic. Fables often also have a rural, outdoor setting. This is true of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which is set on a beautiful coast: "It was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle sea."</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Dreams are common to us all. Dreams are special as well. We probably keep ourselves many of our dreams for fear of ridicule or misunderstanding. Oftentimes, we may have selectively shared our dreams, those w figured out would get approval. The ones closest and dearest to us, the one we feel most vulnerable about, we may choose to treasure to our hearts only, sometimes thinking, “If only you know”, sometimes wondering if we are being silly. We believe that our dreams are spirit filled. They are gifts to encourage us. Like a ship at the sea needing a “heading” to move forward, our dreams give direction to our lives. Our frustration maybe that we can’t realize a dream without many steps and much time. But life is a process of steps. Success in anything comes inch by inch, stroke by stroke and step by step.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your own dreams come true."
</p><p></p><p>As humans, we have different aspirations and dreams in life. Our dreams may not be as natural and acceptable as of others but they are our own. Those dreams fuel our earnest desires to live. Daring to live the life you have dreamed means that you need to follow your dreams. Do whatever it takes to fulfill that desire. Never believe in your doubts nor doubt your belief. It is your life, your passion, your decision and the one who will be taking the consequence will be you and not the people around you. So do not be afraid to dream. Never fail to pursue. Never be hesitant of your passion. Dream big and live big. It's all that it takes to live a happy and contended life.

COMPARE Jonathan with the rest of his Flock.
USE Jonathan's story to explain the meaning of life.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>John Livingston Seagull is often referred to as a "fable." A fable is a short story that conveys a moral and uses some key features. The most important feature of a fable is the moral of the story. In John Livingston Seagull, the moral is to go against the crowd and to follow your own desires despite what others think.</p><p>Typically, characters are animals in fables, whose characteristics and behaviors are then used by the author to tell us something about human nature. For example, Jonathan's desire to fly rather than eat represents the human desire to be individualistic. Fables often also have a rural, outdoor setting. This is true of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which is set on a beautiful coast: "It was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle sea."</p><p></p><br />
