                                            Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</a>

                            6. Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</h2><br />
