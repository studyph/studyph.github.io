                                            1. Electric Circuit is a close loop through which current can flow. 2. Conducting wires are devices that maintains a constant amount of voltage. 3. Voltage Source is special kind of conductors where current can pass through easily. 4. Electric switch is a device that can control the entrance of current. 5. Electric load in as electric device that converts electrical energy to heat like in the case of electric iron, and to light the heat like in the case of a bulb. 6. Series circuit consist of one loop. 7. Parallel Circuit has two or more loops. 8. A parallel connection does not overheat easily. 9. In a series circuit, there is one path for the current to flow from the voltage source. 10. More light bulb in a series circuit can decrease the brightness of the bulb 11. All loads in parallel connection are not directly connected to the voltage source. 12. In parallel circuit if one light bulb is damaged all other light bulb will function. 13. All light bulbs and appliances at home are connected in parallel switching off some appliances does not affect other appliances. 14. In parallel circuit overloading may happen if appliances are simultaneously used at home. 15. In parallel connection it requires the use of several conducting wires of varying sizes.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.Produce electricity2.Geothermal energy5.Renewable resources6.A spillway7.Solar energy comes from the sun. Some people use solar panels on their homes to convert sunlight into electricity.Wind turbines, which look like giant windmills, generate electricity.Geothermal energy comes from the Earth's crust.Engineers extract steam or very hot water from the Earth's crust and use the steam to generate electricity.Biomass includes natural products such as wood, manure and corn. These materials are burned and used for heat.Dams and rivers generate hydropower. When water flows through a dam it activates a turbine, which runs an electric generator.9.Because the source of hydroelectric power is water hydroelectric power plants are usually located on or near a water source.10.A geothermal solution containing appreciable amounts of sodium chloride or other salts is called as. Explanation: brine is a high-concentration solution of salt (usually sodium chloride) in water<p></p><p></p>SANA MAKATULONG CORRECT ME IF IM WRONGPA BRAINLEST PLSSS<p></p><p></p><br />
