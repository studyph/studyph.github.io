Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

Breakfast is often called the most important meal of the day(Henager, 2010). Eating breakfast allows one's body to start the day off right. With the rightnutrients, your breakfast can be a great way to function properly. It is true that many studentsare coming to schools without eating breakfast for various reasons or students are making poornutritional choices at breakfast times for many reasons including: not enough time in themoming, eating habits, and food preferences. According to Bailey (2003), any of these can leadto a lack of concentration at school or throughout the day or even weight issues in the future.Poor breakfast choices can be blamed on education, historical developments, and income andsocial determinants. In addition, children who skip meals barely meet the required dietary intake.This results to lethargy and difficulty in doing mental tasks (Bailey and Earl, 1993).44i-brainlist you kapag na anseran mo​</a>

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.
