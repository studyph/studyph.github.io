                                            Text: Self-discipline refers to the training that one gives one's self to accomplish a certain task or to adopt a particular pattern of behaviour although one would really rather be doing something else. For example, denying oneself of one's favourite cheesecake that is high in calories for an oat biscuit On the other hand, willpower is the ability to overcome laziness and procrastination. It is the ability to control or reject harmful impulses. It is also the ability to arrive to a decision and follow through with it with perseverance until its successful accomplishment Willpower gets stronger by holding back and not allowing the expression of unimportant, unnecessary and unhealthy thoughts feelings, actions and reactions. If this saved energy is not allowed expression, it is stored inside you like a battery and becomes available at the time of need. In fact, it is one of the corner stones of success, both spiritual and material. Self-discipline is the companion of will power. It is the assertion of willpower over more base desires. To some extent, it acts as a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine a best course of action that opposes one's desires. It endows us with , the stamina to persevere in whatever one does. It bestows the ability to withstand hardships and difficulties, whether physical, emotional or mental. Willpower and self-discipline help us to choose our behaviour and reactions instead of being ruled by them With their possession, you will feel in charge of yourself and your surroundings. As such, you are bound to feel happy and satisfied.​ PA HELP PA SUMMARIZE LANG PO</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Energy is transferred between trophic levels when one organism eats another and gets the energy-rich molecules from its prey's body. However, these transfers are inefficient, and this inefficiency limits the length of food chains.</p><p></p><p>2. biogeochemical cycle are found everywhere around us.</p><p></p><p>Many biogeochemical cycles affect our daily lives in many ways. A prime example of one of these cycles is the water cycle. The constant changing states of water and how it interacts with our environment ( both gas, ice, and liquid states). Some key words with the water cycle include condensation, precipitation, and evaporation</p><p></p><p>Another great example in our everyday lives is the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The constant respiration from animals and photosynthesis from plants creates a constant cycle which has been continuing for millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Other cycles include the nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and sulfur cycle. Even today scientists are beginning to discover new cycles such as weather patterns, and human impact on the environment, which can drastically change the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles.</p><p></p><p>3. A biogeochemical cycle is a process where a type of element moves through nature. An element moves through nature by the break down and build up of molecules the element is a part of. To give an example, think about carbon. Carbon is present in gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere. Vegetation sequesters CO2 through photosynthesis. Plants turn CO2 into sugars to store energy absorbed by the sun. These sugars are then stored by the plant for later catabolic purpose.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />

                            21. Text: Self-discipline refers to the training that one gives one's self to accomplish a certain task or to adopt a particular pattern of behaviour although one would really rather be doing something else. For example, denying oneself of one's favourite cheesecake that is high in calories for an oat biscuit On the other hand, willpower is the ability to overcome laziness and procrastination. It is the ability to control or reject harmful impulses. It is also the ability to arrive to a decision and follow through with it with perseverance until its successful accomplishment Willpower gets stronger by holding back and not allowing the expression of unimportant, unnecessary and unhealthy thoughts feelings, actions and reactions. If this saved energy is not allowed expression, it is stored inside you like a battery and becomes available at the time of need. In fact, it is one of the corner stones of success, both spiritual and material. Self-discipline is the companion of will power. It is the assertion of willpower over more base desires. To some extent, it acts as a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine a best course of action that opposes one's desires. It endows us with , the stamina to persevere in whatever one does. It bestows the ability to withstand hardships and difficulties, whether physical, emotional or mental. Willpower and self-discipline help us to choose our behaviour and reactions instead of being ruled by them With their possession, you will feel in charge of yourself and your surroundings. As such, you are bound to feel happy and satisfied.​ PA HELP PA SUMMARIZE LANG PO</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-discipline involves training that one gives oneself to perform a specific activity or to adopt a specific pattern of behavior even though one would rather be doing something else. For example, foregoing a high-calorie cheesecake in favor of an oat biscuit. Willpower, on the other hand, is the ability to overcome lethargy and procrastination. It refers to the ability to resist or control harmful urges. It is also the ability to make a decision and stick to it until it is completed successfully. Willpower grows stronger by resisting the expression of trivial, unnecessary, and unhealthy thoughts, feelings, actions, and reactions.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Willpower and self-discipline allow us to choose our behavior and reactions rather than being governed by them.
