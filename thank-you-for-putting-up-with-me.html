Be able to a Comprehension Questions: Junk Foods: To Eat or Not to Eat Lea E. Basquinas Junk food is unhealthy. It is greasy and fatty; and if eaten regularly, definitely won't help anyone to be healthy. It can even make you sick! Your teachers and parents remind you these all the time. However, as unhealthy as it may seem, it is still one of those foods that pupils like you love to eat. If you really want to have a healthy lifestyle, then you should stop eating junk foods at once! You should choose to keep your body healthy. Stop eating junk food because there are no vitamins in it. It can never help you maintain a good and healthy body.

These are nutritious foods that can help your body become healthier. Ask yourself this, "Will I let junk food tempt me, or not? Well, it's up to you.

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

                                            The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

Half an hour later, Mariah heard the baby siir, and start to cry. "Coming. Timmy!" Mariah walked up the stairs and turned into the room Timmy shared with his teenage brother, Tony. She pulled Timmy from his crib changed his diaper, and took him downstairs to feed him. Just as she put Timmy in his high char, Mariah was startled to hear a voice over the baby monitor. "Yeah, I'll do it. I'll prove that I can take a dare by stealing a bike" Mariah had no time to react. Mrs. Marcos was coming in the back door with bogs of groceries. Here, Mrs. Marcos, let me help you." When Mariah returned home, her brother, Brandon, was sitting at the kitchen table drinking chocolate milk. Brandon's best friend, Jett, sat on the counter. "I'd like some of that milk too." said Jett "Maybe I'll go down to the comer store and get some. Guess what happened while I was baby-sitting Timmy?" Marian asked them. "I heard someone say they were going to steal a bicycle. The voice was coming from the baby monitor in Timmy's room. "I bet it was his brother, Tony said Jelf.

MY HAMSTER
I used to play with my hamster every morning then I put him back into his cage after.
But one day, I have not noticed the cage door got loose so he escaped. I saw him run
by my feet. Then I grabbed him quickly and hit the lamp on the side table. The lamp
feels and crashes to the ground, making a loud noise. Suddenly, my brother who is in
the room upset that he was awaken from his nap. My hamster was sitting in front of me,
looking up and smiling. I reached down to grab him, but he took oft under the sofa and
into the kitchen. Then, I heard the scream, I knew my eldest sister had seen my pet.
She scooped into a colander and put him back into his cage. I tightly secured the cage
door, and he was back in his home. I watched him play all day and gave him food to eat.

"Dear Mouse, I come to your house all the time. Now, I invited you to mine!" "I would love to my dear friend, but your house is across the stream, I don't know how to swim, and I am afraid I will drown, the mouse replied. "Don't worry, I have a plan. You can climb on my back and can tie you to me with strong blade of glass. That way, you will be safe to cross the stream," said the frog. To this, the mouse immediately agreed, and they set forth. Halfway across the stream, however, the frog started to get wicked thoughts. "If I were to let the mouse drown, I can get all his food stock and never have worry about being hungry for a long, long time!" the frog thought. So, the wicked frog, dive from the bottom of the stream. The mouse realizing too late the betrayal of the frog and started to cry for help. "Help me! Help me!" cried the mouse. A hawk flying above the stream saw the scene and swooped down upon the mouse. The hawk picked him up with its beak and started to fly high into the sky.

In his greed to get more food, he had not lost only his good friend, but also put his own life into danger.Questions:11. who is the protagonist?12. who is the antagonist in the story?13. where is the setting?14. what is the story plot?15. what is the rising action?Answer my questions please...ibrabrainlest ko po yung makakasagot...thank you​</a>

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

Elephant and FriendsOne day an elephant wandered into a forest in search of friends. He saw a monkey on a tree. "Will you be my friend? asked the elephant. Replied the monkey, "You are too big. You cannot swing from trees like me. "Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friend. But the rabbit said, "You are too big to play in my burrow! "Then the elephant met a frog. " Will you be my friend? He asked. "How can I? "asked the frog. "You are too big to leap like me. "Then the elephant was upset. He met a fox next. "Will you be my friend? he asked the fox. The fox said "Sorry sir, you are too big. "The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running for their lives. The elephant asked them what the matter was. The bear replied, "There is a tiger in the forest. He's trying to gobble us up! "The animals ran away to hide. The elephant wondered what he could do to save everyone in the forest. Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find. The elephant has no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick. The frightened tiger ran for his life. The elephant ambled back into the forest to announce the good news to everyone. All the animals thanked the elephant. They said, You are just the right size to be our friend.Title of information text:________Type of information next:________Three informational gathered from text:______Paki answer po​</a>

                                            Summarize
1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</a>

                            5. THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</h2><br />

                            6. The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

MY HAMSTER
I used to play with my hamster every morning then I put him back into his cage after.
But one day, I have not noticed the cage door got loose so he escaped. I saw him run
by my feet. Then I grabbed him quickly and hit the lamp on the side table. The lamp
feels and crashes to the ground, making a loud noise. Suddenly, my brother who is in
the room upset that he was awaken from his nap. My hamster was sitting in front of me,
looking up and smiling. I reached down to grab him, but he took oft under the sofa and
into the kitchen. Then, I heard the scream, I knew my eldest sister had seen my pet.
She scooped into a colander and put him back into his cage. I tightly secured the cage
door, and he was back in his home. I watched him play all day and gave him food to eat.

THE THIEF WHO BECAME A DISCIPLE The Thief Who Became a Disciple From Zen Parables translated by Paul RepsOne evening as Shichiri Kojun was reciting sutras, a thief with a sharp sword entered, demanding either his money or his life. Shichiri told him, “Do not disturb me. You may find the money in that drawer.” Then he resumed his recitation. A little while afterward, he stopped and called: “Don’t take it all. I will need some to pay the taxes with tomorrow.”The intruder gathered up most of the money and started to leave. “Thank a person when you receive a gift,” Shichiri added. The man thanked him and made off. A few days afterward, the fellow was caught and confessed, among others, the offense against Shichiri. When Shichiri was called as a witness, he said, “This man is no thief, at least as far as I’m concerned. I gave him the money and he thanked me for it.”After he had finished his prison term, the man went to Shichiri and became his disciple.1)which proverbs summarizes the messages of the story a. an opportunity comes only once b. an eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth c. shichiri became a witness and testify that the man did not rub himd. the robber and its fellow was caught and put to prison ​</h2><br />

You can climb on my back and can tie you to me with strong blade of glass. That way, you will be safe to cross the stream," said the frog. To this, the mouse immediately agreed, and they set forth.

                            23. THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</h2><br />

1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</h2><br />
