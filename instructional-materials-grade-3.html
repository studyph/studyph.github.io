Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative leaming activities which are student centered approach is recommended to modern pedagogy especially today that we used outcome-based education. 2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post- test. 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significan values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level o significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative leaming activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis. 4. Adclitional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners. 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.​</a>

                                            → Learning Task 3 Instructions: Read and understand the following informational report on plastic pollution, answer the questions that follow. Plastics and Environmental Pollution As more and more plants are used, more plastic waste is generated. This waste contributes a lot to environmental pollution because plastics do not break down easily. Methods of minimizing the problem have been proposed. One of these methods is recycling. Usually, big industries recycle by cleaning and separating the plastics by type. Then they remelt and reform the thermoplastics into new products by either grinding them into fine powder or shredding them. The powder is used as filler. The shreds can be used as insulation in quilted jackets and sleeping bags. In households, plastic items can be separated from other waste materials. The plastic materials can then be donated or sold to plastic manufacturers. Another proposal is to use only plastics that are biodegradable (those that break down through the action of microorganisms). Some plastics photodegradable. This means that they break down through long exposure to sunlight. Today, there are trash bags, foam cups, and other biodegradable plastics. But environmental groups look at these products with distrust. They argue that even under the best conditions, plastic products leave plastic residue behind and these will not break down at all when buried in landfills. They also feel that the chemicals added to make plastics biodegradable also make the plastics unfit for recycling. For good or for bad, the use of plastics has brought humankind to a turning point. Answer the following points: 1. Why does plastic waste contribute a lot to environmental pollution? 2. How can the problem of plastic pollution be minimized? 3. As a grade six pupil, which of the proposals mentioned will you be able to take some action? Why? 4. If you were asked about the total ban on the use of plastic materials, what Is your stand?

________________ 1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which are student-centered approach is recommended to modern pedagogy especially today that we used outcome-based education.
________________ 2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.
________________ 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significant values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis.
________________ 4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners.
________________ 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.</a>

Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal ofSocial Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which arestudent-centered approach is recommended to modem pedagogy especially todaythat we used outcome-based education.2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing anadopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significantvalues of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</a>

This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post- test. 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significan values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level o significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative leaming activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis. 4. Adclitional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners. 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.​</h2><br />

                            8. → Learning Task 3 Instructions: Read and understand the following informational report on plastic pollution, answer the questions that follow. Plastics and Environmental Pollution As more and more plants are used, more plastic waste is generated. This waste contributes a lot to environmental pollution because plastics do not break down easily. Methods of minimizing the problem have been proposed. One of these methods is recycling. Usually, big industries recycle by cleaning and separating the plastics by type. Then they remelt and reform the thermoplastics into new products by either grinding them into fine powder or shredding them. The powder is used as filler. The shreds can be used as insulation in quilted jackets and sleeping bags. In households, plastic items can be separated from other waste materials. The plastic materials can then be donated or sold to plastic manufacturers. Another proposal is to use only plastics that are biodegradable (those that break down through the action of microorganisms). Some plastics photodegradable. This means that they break down through long exposure to sunlight. Today, there are trash bags, foam cups, and other biodegradable plastics. But environmental groups look at these products with distrust. They argue that even under the best conditions, plastic products leave plastic residue behind and these will not break down at all when buried in landfills. They also feel that the chemicals added to make plastics biodegradable also make the plastics unfit for recycling. For good or for bad, the use of plastics has brought humankind to a turning point. Answer the following points: 1. Why does plastic waste contribute a lot to environmental pollution? 2. How can the problem of plastic pollution be minimized? 3. As a grade six pupil, which of the proposals mentioned will you be able to take some action? Why? 4. If you were asked about the total ban on the use of plastic materials, what Is your stand?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The SMART principle is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. In the decision making process for sales strategies, these factors should be considered to ensure that the goals set are clear and attainable. Specificity means that the objective is well-defined and clear. Measurability is important to track the progress of the sales strategies towards the objective. Achievability ensures that the objective is realistic and achievable. Relevance means that the objective is aligned with the company's overall goals. Lastly, time-bound means that the objective has a deadline, which helps in monitoring progress and setting priorities.</p><p></p><p>An illustrative and explanatory example of an annual objective is to increase the sales revenue by 20% by the end of the fiscal year. To achieve this objective, sales strategies should be incorporated, such as creating a referral program, expanding the customer base, and introducing new products or services. The referral program can be tracked through referral codes or links to measure its effectiveness. The expansion of the customer base can be measured by analyzing the increase in the number of new customers. Introducing new products or services can be tracked by monitoring the sales revenue generated from these products. To make this annual objective SMART, the 20% increase in sales revenue should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.</p><p></p><p>In creating a contingency plan for the annual objective of increasing sales revenue, three pathways can be considered. First, if the referral program does not work, alternative methods of promoting the product or service should be considered. Second, if the expansion of the customer base is not effective, the company can consider diversifying its product or service offerings to reach a wider market. Third, if the introduction of new products or services is not generating enough revenue, the company can consider rebranding or redesigning the products to appeal to the target market better.</p><p></p><p>The PEST analysis is an essential tool in the sales strategies to analyze the external factors that affect the market. The four factors under PEST analysis are Political, Economic, Social, and Technological. The political factor includes government regulations and policies that can affect the market. The economic factor refers to the economic conditions, such as inflation and recession, that can impact the purchasing power of consumers. The social factor includes cultural and societal changes that can affect consumer behavior. Lastly, the technological factor refers to the advancements in technology that can affect the production and distribution of products or services. Analyzing these factors can help companies make informed decisions on their sales strategies to adapt to the changes in the market.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p></p><p>Kotler, P., &amp; Keller, K.

________________ 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significant values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis.

                            21. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The main difference between consumer and organizational buyers is the purpose of their purchases. Consumer buyers are individuals or households that buy goods and services for personal use, while organizational buyers are businesses, governments, and institutions that buy goods and services for their operations or resale. Consumer buyers tend to make purchase decisions based on personal preferences, emotions, and perceptions, while organizational buyers focus on criteria such as price, quality, reliability, and supplier relationships. For example, a consumer buyer may purchase a new phone based on its brand reputation or features, while an organizational buyer may purchase new computers based on their compatibility with existing software and hardware systems.</p><p></p><p>The Blackwell, Miniard, and Engel model identifies five roles of who buys in the consumer and organizational buying processes: initiator, influencer, decider, buyer, and user. For example, in the consumer buying process for a new car, the initiator could be the person who first expresses the need or desire for a new car, the influencer could be a family member or friend who provides advice or recommendations, the decider could be the person who makes the final decision on the car model and features, the buyer could be the person who negotiates the price and purchase terms, and the user could be the person who actually drives and uses the car. In the organizational buying process for new software, the initiator could be an IT manager who identifies the need for better software, the influencer could be a consultant or a vendor who recommends a specific solution, the decider could be a procurement or finance manager who approves the purchase, the buyer could be a purchasing agent who negotiates the contract and terms, and the user could be the employees who use the software in their work.</p><p></p><p>Several factors can affect the consumer decision-making process, including personal factors (e.g., age, income, lifestyle, personality), psychological factors (e.g., motivation, perception, learning, beliefs, attitudes), social factors (e.g., family, culture, reference groups, social class), and situational factors (e.g., time, place, occasion, urgency). For example, a consumer may decide to purchase a luxury watch based on their self-image and social status, their perception of the watch's quality and brand reputation, their cultural values and traditions, and the occasion or purpose of the purchase (e.g., a gift for a special occasion). Alternatively, a consumer may decide to purchase a basic watch based on its affordability, practicality, and functional features, and their lifestyle and personal preferences.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p></p><p>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Harris, L.
