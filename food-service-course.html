                                            The family business, a fast-food franchise, has two(2) outlets - one in a Quezon city mall and the other in Caloocan City. The fast food outlet supervisors report to the owner-manager, whose office is in the family residence located in Quezon City. The owner's daughters do not attend the meetings as they are either in school or attending to their concerns.
The store supervisors meet with the owner-manager weekly, although the owner's daughters take turns in visiting the outlets every morning, at opening time and evening, at closing time. The owner's daughters give instructions to the store supervisors concerning operations, such as counting supplies and turning over cash sales. Often, the daughters do the purchasing, banking, and delivery task for the outlets.
The owner-manager is thinking of permanently putting his children on the payroll of the enterprise upon their college graduation. One daughter is a college senior, taking up a management course. The other daughter is a student in a culinary course.

Create an organizational chart for the family food service outlets to include the owner's children.</a>

                            24. The family business, a fast-food franchise, has two(2) outlets - one in a Quezon city mall and the other in Caloocan City. The fast food outlet supervisors report to the owner-manager, whose office is in the family residence located in Quezon City. The owner's daughters do not attend the meetings as they are either in school or attending to their concerns.
The store supervisors meet with the owner-manager weekly, although the owner's daughters take turns in visiting the outlets every morning, at opening time and evening, at closing time. The owner's daughters give instructions to the store supervisors concerning operations, such as counting supplies and turning over cash sales. Often, the daughters do the purchasing, banking, and delivery task for the outlets.
The owner-manager is thinking of permanently putting his children on the payroll of the enterprise upon their college graduation. One daughter is a college senior, taking up a management course. The other daughter is a student in a culinary course.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create an organizational chart for the family food service outlets to include the owner's children.</h2><br />
                        <p>The <strong>organizational chart</strong> should start with the owner of the stores. He is then followed by his <strong>daughters </strong>who act as the manager of the stores. Then, the rank that is next to his daughters would be the <strong>store supervisor.</strong></p><p></p><p>Here is the explanation of the chart. Attached below is the sample <strong>organizational chart </strong>that the company should follow.</p><p></p><strong>Tier 1 (Owner)<br /></strong>The top-most tier is the <strong>store owner </strong>or the <strong>father</strong>. He is the control center of all the decisions made in every store. Since there are two branches, there should also be two roots after him. One is for the <strong>Caloocan branch</strong> and the other is for the Quezon City branch.<br /><br /><strong>Tier 2 (Daughters and payroll)<br /></strong>The <strong>daughters </strong>play as the s<strong>tore managers</strong> who take turns in visiting the stores every week. Since the owner is planning to put his daughters in the<strong> payroll department</strong> of the enterprise, all payroll-related transactions should be reported to and from them.<br /><br /><strong>Tier 3 (Store supervisors)<br /></strong>The <strong>supervisors </strong>are the head of the branches. They monitor and report the debits and credits of the branch. They would need to report to the <strong>daughters </strong>of the <strong>owner </strong>before relaying the <strong>information </strong>to the store owner.<p></p><p>For more information, please head over to this link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1013712</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
