                            5. Read and analyze the short paragraphs below and underline one sentence in eachwhich is irrelevant or not related to the topic. Write your responses on a separate sheet.1. I dislike being stressed in the morning. Therefore, I wake up two hours before leaving forwork. This means having to go to bed very early in the evening. Otherwise, I wouldn't be wellenough rested. Eating my breakfast is a thing I should not forget.2. Public transportation plays a pivotal role in human life nowadays. Many people use differentmodes to travel between places, such as train, bus, and taxi. Fare should be taken intoconsideration. However, using public transit has its own advantages and disadvantages.3. My favorite color is blue. Blue sports cars go very fast. I like it because it is calming and itrelaxes me. I often go outside in the summer and lie on the grass and look into the clear skywhen I am stressed. For this reason. I'd have to say my favorite color is blue.4. Mr. Park resisted pressure to take a job with a large corporation and rejected the securityand prestige that comes with such employment. He spent two years trying to convince hiswife and family that he had real entrepreneurial talent. His children are very supportive ofhim.

Currently, the United Nations observes the holiday as a way to bring to lightwomen's issues around the world.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Eating my breakfast is a thing I should not forget.</p><p>2. Fare should be taken into consideration.</p><p>3. Blue sports cars go very fast.</p><p>4. His children are very supportive of him.</p><p>5. Women are more powerful than men.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The topic is all about the speaker's dislike about being stressed, and the need to be well-rested, so the mention of breakfast is very irrelevant to the topic.</p><p>2. Although fare is indeed connected to public transportation, which is the main topic, it is not really necessary to include in the paragraph.</p><p>3. Yes, the color blue was mentioned as the color of the sports car, but it is very irrelevant when you compare it to the other sentences, thus should be omitted.</p><p>4. It doesn't really matter whether Mr. Park's children supports him or not. Comparing this sentence to the other sentences within the paragraphs deemed it as a very irrelevant sentence.</p><p>5. Now this sentence is very obvious, it just came out of nowhere. The main topic is the International Women's Day, so this sentence doesn't really mean much when included in this paragraph.</p><br />

The best way to capture the interest of the audience is to take advantage of the right <strong>communicative strategy</strong> whenever we give a talk.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Seven Communicative Strategies:</strong></p><strong>Nomination Strategy</strong><strong><br /></strong>When someone is presenting a particular topic, or saying what he thinks is relevant, he is using the <strong>nomination strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Restriction</strong><strong><br /></strong>With the support of enough set of categories that are to be constrained by a particular response or reaction, someone is using a <strong>restriction strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Turn-taking</strong><strong><br /></strong>A person knows when to speak or respond because he knows when is the right time to speak or his turn. That uis when someone applies the <strong>turn-taking strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic control</strong><strong><br /></strong>Someone is using the <strong>topic control strategy</strong> by making sure that the interaction is ongoing. The use of topic control strategy requires techniques to keep the <strong>conversation going.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic shifting</strong><strong><br /></strong>The process of <strong>topic shifting</strong> is continuing a communication or interaction by asking relevant questions or elaborating what someone said.<br /><strong>Repair</strong><strong><br /></strong>When the communication is not in good shape, <strong>a repair strategy </strong>is being done to overcome communication breakdown.<br /><strong>Termination</strong><strong><br /></strong>It uses verbal or nonverbal signals to end communication or interaction.<br /><p>It is important for us to learn the different types of communicative strategies and properly use them in every situation.
