Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</p>

(23-24) Have you ever wondered how plants and trees can produce oxygen? Yes! Oxygen is the gas that we, humans, use to breathe. Without oxygen, our lungs will not be able to function. Oxygen, just like other gasses in the atmosphere and our planet, is not visible to our eyes. Plants produce oxygen through a process called photosynthesis. The word photosynthesis came from the Greek words photo and synesthesia. These words mean “light” and “to put together,” respectively. In this process, plants use the light energy from the sun and convert it to chemical energy. Plants absorb light using chloroplasts — this gives leaves their green color. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen oxide (H2O), more commonly known as water, are absorbed by the plant from the ground and the air. All these three are converted in the plant cells, allowing the plants to produce food for themselves in the forms of energy and sugar. In the end, plants release oxygen as a byproduct.​</a>

He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</a>

The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

After that, identify the literary devices used. WOMAN WITH CHILDEmmanuel TorresAlready slow, so soon, she remarks funneling each wordWith her lips like a new ache: how far the hardwood doorIs from the stiff-backed chair where knitting needlesLie, the windows in various places all the time.Edges nudge; shapes are clumsy under her palm, exceptWhen they are round as porcelain teapots or saucers pinkWith Japanese blossoms, and as frail. Then, she is readyTo smile, and her hands refuse to tremble regarding Them. However, she is not brave to confront mirrors,As if her face would go blank with time’s concern:Leftovers spoiling fast, dishes stacked inThe skink, the faulty faucet dripping. Like passion,Pain can be untidy, leaving things half-done.He by the burly doorway pauses, cowedBy the blunt and patient labors of love.But today she is strong enough to forgive, though sky Is heavy with summer light and fliesSwarm round the refuse in the yard. Half-nakedBoys swing down the ravished mango tree in fear Of her; like monkey shadows (three little evils)They hide in privy corners, sitting on their haunches.Her temples throb anger. But the hurt passes,Moistens into cool sweat in this hot afternoonWith wind. Wordless by the window, he watches hermoveDown in the back lot among the hibiscus.She carries ably the double shapes of loveWithout excuse, regal as a virgin, whileShe reaps the wash from the sagging clothesline.But O,How the slender doves gather round her for feed,How her loose skirt in the wind swells and swells.

Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />

                            3. Read and summarize the explanation text below. Your summary must not be over five sentences. (23-24) Have you ever wondered how plants and trees can produce oxygen? Yes! Oxygen is the gas that we, humans, use to breathe. Without oxygen, our lungs will not be able to function. Oxygen, just like other gasses in the atmosphere and our planet, is not visible to our eyes. Plants produce oxygen through a process called photosynthesis. The word photosynthesis came from the Greek words photo and synesthesia. These words mean “light” and “to put together,” respectively. In this process, plants use the light energy from the sun and convert it to chemical energy. Plants absorb light using chloroplasts — this gives leaves their green color. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen oxide (H2O), more commonly known as water, are absorbed by the plant from the ground and the air. All these three are converted in the plant cells, allowing the plants to produce food for themselves in the forms of energy and sugar. In the end, plants release oxygen as a byproduct.​</h2><br />

He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</h2><br />

                            18. Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

                            19. Activity 1: Paraphrasing the Poem and Identifying Literary DevicesDirection: Paraphrase the poem in order to express your understanding of it as well as to reveal its simple and raw meaning. After that, identify the literary devices used. WOMAN WITH CHILDEmmanuel TorresAlready slow, so soon, she remarks funneling each wordWith her lips like a new ache: how far the hardwood doorIs from the stiff-backed chair where knitting needlesLie, the windows in various places all the time.Edges nudge; shapes are clumsy under her palm, exceptWhen they are round as porcelain teapots or saucers pinkWith Japanese blossoms, and as frail. Then, she is readyTo smile, and her hands refuse to tremble regarding Them. However, she is not brave to confront mirrors,As if her face would go blank with time’s concern:Leftovers spoiling fast, dishes stacked inThe skink, the faulty faucet dripping. Like passion,Pain can be untidy, leaving things half-done.He by the burly doorway pauses, cowedBy the blunt and patient labors of love.But today she is strong enough to forgive, though sky Is heavy with summer light and fliesSwarm round the refuse in the yard. Half-nakedBoys swing down the ravished mango tree in fear Of her; like monkey shadows (three little evils)They hide in privy corners, sitting on their haunches.Her temples throb anger. But the hurt passes,Moistens into cool sweat in this hot afternoonWith wind. Wordless by the window, he watches hermoveDown in the back lot among the hibiscus.She carries ably the double shapes of loveWithout excuse, regal as a virgin, whileShe reaps the wash from the sagging clothesline.But O,How the slender doves gather round her for feed,How her loose skirt in the wind swells and swells.
