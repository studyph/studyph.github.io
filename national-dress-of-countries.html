I want the teachers to watch closely the conduct of their pupils. You must help them to be courteous; show them their duties and make them comprehend that duty is more important than knowledge. I expect the division superintendent, the school principals, the district supervisors, and all classroom teachers to join hands with me in my efforts to make both the present and the coming generations responsible people. I want you, young men and young women, to be the right kind of men and women who will be able to assume that burden which our people will face once we are an independent nation. True patriotism does not consist in shouting your love for your country. True patriotism is shown in your everyday life. True patriotism does not consist in shouting that you are willing to die for your country. We are not bound to be heroes all the time; nor is there an opportunity to be heroes every day. Just do your duty every day and you will be patriots. As a student your duty is to study well and as a man to be good. Your duty is to work well until you become a good citizen. And don't give too much importance to clothing, good eating, and pleasure. Eat enough to keep you healthy, dress well to look decent, enjoy enough to give your spirit emotion and your nerves relaxation, but all the time you must have an objective in your life, have an idea-a noble idea-and pursue it.please answer this seriously because I really need this.​</a>

The war might have destroyed factories and burned the countryside through the battles of liberation in the country,the will of the Filipino people survived. In this time, all around smiling face, laughter and song sorrouded the Philippines attracting more visitors and tourist in the country.With the popularity of the hippie culture in the late 1960s many Filipinos embraced this culture which has continued until the early seventies. At the same time, the rise of Filipino nationalism began and both movements influenced the way people live and dressed.The 1070s and 1980s were considered turbulent years for the Philippine film industry bringing both positive and negative changes, as matter of fact nationalism was at it's height during the 70s Manila was once called the Paris of Asia and the Philippines was considered a very peaceful country however it all went down because of the mortial law and EDSA revolution.pa explain pothank you ​</a>

The king saw the shock in the man's eye and said," Yes, I was the beggar you met on your way." "But...bu...bu... why did you dress up like a beggar. You are king. Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart. Looking at your love and generosity towards the beggar proved that you sincerely love your fellow human beings.

True patriotism does not consist in shouting that you are willing to die for your country. We are not bound to be heroes all the time; nor is there an opportunity to be heroes every day. Just do your duty every day and you will be patriots. As a student your duty is to study well and as a man to be good. Your duty is to work well until you become a good citizen. And don't give too much importance to clothing, good eating, and pleasure. Eat enough to keep you healthy, dress well to look decent, enjoy enough to give your spirit emotion and your nerves relaxation, but all the time you must have an objective in your life, have an idea-a noble idea-and pursue it.please answer this seriously because I really need this.​</h2><br />

                            30. The young man bowed low as the king entered the room. When he raised his eyes, he gasped in astonishment as he noticed that the king looked very similar to the begger, he met on the way. The king saw the shock in the man's eye and said," Yes, I was the beggar you met on your way." "But...bu...bu... why did you dress up like a beggar. You are king. Well, then, why did you do this to me?" the young man stammered after gaining some composure. "Because I had to be sure that you had a good heart and genuinely love your fellow human beings," said the king. "I knew that if I came to you asking, you would have done anything to impress me. But that way I would never have known what is truly in your heart. So I used a ruse. Beggar had nothing to offer you. The generosity and love to the one in need without expecting anything in return is the sign of a great heart. Looking at your love and generosity towards the beggar proved that you sincerely love your fellow human beings. This country needs a leader who would work for the welfare of all of the nation, not just ones who would offer and cater to the throne. You have proved that you are the right person to be my successor," promised the king.
