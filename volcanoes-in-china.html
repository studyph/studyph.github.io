VOLCANO
A volcano is a geological landform, usually in the shape of a mountain. It forms the opening in Earth’s surface through which molten lava and gases erupt. Volcanoes are of three types: active, dormant, and extinct. Mount Vesuvius, Mauna Loa, and Mount Unzen are examples of volcanoes.
CANYONS
 A canyon is a deep narrow valley. They are usually formed from the action of rivers. They have very steep sides and are usually made of sandstones or granite. The term “canyon” is used in the United States. In Europe, however, the word “gorge” is more commonly used to describe canyons.
FACTS
• Canyons often form in areas of limestone rock.
 • The deepest canyon in the world is Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon in China.
 • The Grand Canyon was formed by erosions of water and wind.
 • The Three Gorges region is located along the Yangtze River in China. 
• The Taroko Gorge is well known for its abundant supply of marble.
 • The Valles Marineris on Mars is the largest known canyon in the solar system.
 • The Verdon Gorge in southeastern France is considered Europe's most beautiful gorge.
FACTS
• The word volcano comes from the Roman god of fire, Vulcan .
 • The largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii's Mauna Loa.
 • Volcanoes that erupt regularly are called active.
 • Dormant volcanoes are those that are not currently active.
 • Extinct volcanoes are those that are unlikely to erupt again. 
• Yellowstone Caldera volcano is at least 2 million years old and has been dormant for approximately 640,000 years.
 • There are more than 500 active volcanoes in the world. 
• Mount Etna is thought to be the oldest active volcano in the world.</a>

                                            narngWith the exception of Palawan, Mindoro and Romblon, most of the Philippine islands are consideredto have been parts of island arcs formed at the southem edge of the Philippine Sea plate millions of yearsago.The first Philippine Island showed up about 60 million years ago. It is the island of Mindoro andPalawan which is very near the island of present-day Taiwan.As part of the Philippine Sea plate, the islands moved northward as the plate rotated clockwise.These roving islands, known as the Philippine Mobile Belt, eventually collided with the Sundaland. Thecollision resulted, among others, in a series of subductions around Philippine archipelago.On the eastern frontier, are the subductions along East Luzon trough and Philippine trench. Thesewestward subductions resulted in the formations of the eastern island arcs of Northern Sierra Madre,Southern Sierra Madre Pohillo-Catanduanes and the East Philippine arc. In time, some of these arcsmerged to-gether forming big islands like Luzon and Mindanao.The Luzon arc is a complex belt of volcanoes extending from the Coastal Range of southeasternTaiwan through the volcanic islands north of Luzon, the Luzon Central Cordillera, and the Western Luzonarc, ending at Marinduque Island. The arc has been active since the Oligocene period to the present.On the western border, are the subductions along trenches of Manila, Negros, Sulu and Celebeswhere the plates of the South China Sea, Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea are subducting beneath the PhilippineSea plate. These eastward subductions resulted in the emergence of the island arcs of Luzon, Negros,Sulu-Zamboanga and Cotabato.​</a>

VOLCANO
A volcano is a geological landform, usually in the shape of a mountain. It forms the opening in Earth’s surface through which molten lava and gases erupt. Volcanoes are of three types: active, dormant, and extinct. Mount Vesuvius, Mauna Loa, and Mount Unzen are examples of volcanoes.
CANYONS
 A canyon is a deep narrow valley. They are usually formed from the action of rivers. They have very steep sides and are usually made of sandstones or granite. The term “canyon” is used in the United States. In Europe, however, the word “gorge” is more commonly used to describe canyons.
FACTS
• Canyons often form in areas of limestone rock.
 • The deepest canyon in the world is Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon in China.
 • The Grand Canyon was formed by erosions of water and wind.
 • The Three Gorges region is located along the Yangtze River in China. 
• The Taroko Gorge is well known for its abundant supply of marble.
 • The Valles Marineris on Mars is the largest known canyon in the solar system.
 • The Verdon Gorge in southeastern France is considered Europe's most beautiful gorge.
FACTS
• The word volcano comes from the Roman god of fire, Vulcan .
 • The largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii's Mauna Loa.
 • Volcanoes that erupt regularly are called active.
 • Dormant volcanoes are those that are not currently active.
 • Extinct volcanoes are those that are unlikely to erupt again. 
• Yellowstone Caldera volcano is at least 2 million years old and has been dormant for approximately 640,000 years.
 • There are more than 500 active volcanoes in the world. 
• Mount Etna is thought to be the oldest active volcano in the world.</h2><br />

                            24. narngWith the exception of Palawan, Mindoro and Romblon, most of the Philippine islands are consideredto have been parts of island arcs formed at the southem edge of the Philippine Sea plate millions of yearsago.The first Philippine Island showed up about 60 million years ago. It is the island of Mindoro andPalawan which is very near the island of present-day Taiwan.As part of the Philippine Sea plate, the islands moved northward as the plate rotated clockwise.These roving islands, known as the Philippine Mobile Belt, eventually collided with the Sundaland. Thecollision resulted, among others, in a series of subductions around Philippine archipelago.On the eastern frontier, are the subductions along East Luzon trough and Philippine trench. Thesewestward subductions resulted in the formations of the eastern island arcs of Northern Sierra Madre,Southern Sierra Madre Pohillo-Catanduanes and the East Philippine arc. In time, some of these arcsmerged to-gether forming big islands like Luzon and Mindanao.The Luzon arc is a complex belt of volcanoes extending from the Coastal Range of southeasternTaiwan through the volcanic islands north of Luzon, the Luzon Central Cordillera, and the Western Luzonarc, ending at Marinduque Island. The arc has been active since the Oligocene period to the present.On the western border, are the subductions along trenches of Manila, Negros, Sulu and Celebeswhere the plates of the South China Sea, Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea are subducting beneath the PhilippineSea plate. These eastward subductions resulted in the emergence of the island arcs of Luzon, Negros,Sulu-Zamboanga and Cotabato.​</h2><br />
