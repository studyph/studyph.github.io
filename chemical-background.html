On your answer sheet, write TRUE if the statement expresses a correct idea, otherwise write LIE.1. Earth is the only known planet where fire can burn.2. Water can be produced by fire.3. When a combustible material is heated, it burns.4. Candles should be placed near the windows with curtains so that it will light brightly.5. To look for fire-fighting equipment in an establishment, look for a square or rectangular signage with white pictogram in a red background.6. In case of fire you may not follow the circular signage with white pictogram in a blue background.7. Fire exit can be color red or green depending on the establishment.8. Class A fires can be put out by carbon dioxide.9. Among the stages of fire, the last stage which is the “decay stage” takes the longest time to finish.10. All fire extinguishers are multipurpose, meaning each one can put out all types of fire caused by any material.11. Fire is a thing, not an event.12. During microwave fire, the best thing to do is unplug or cut off the power and do not open the door or the windows.13. Assuming stable fuel, heat, and oxygen levels, a typical house fire isconstant in size every minute until the fire dies down.14. Using concentrated sunlight, ancient Greeks were able to start fire. A parabolic mirror that focuses solar rays is still used to ignite the Olympic torch.15. Smoking should not be done inside the bedroom.16. Burning pan should not be covered with lid, instead pour water.17. Oily rags can undergo spontaneous combustion, so store it in a cool and dry place.18. Use extension cord for your television when it is too far from the main outlet19. A small fire inside a glass container dies down when it is tightly covered.20. In photosynthesis, sunlight and heat make chemical energy (in the form of wood or fossil fuel); fire uses chemical energy to produce light and heat.​</a>

Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place.   	Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy.  Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant. Without sunlight and a gas from the air, plants can’t live nor grow to the fullest. 1 what's the problem2 what's the background information3. what's Hypothesis4.

Refer to the given illustration. How does sunlight affect the growth of a plant? In most plants, photosynthesis takes place mainly in the leaves. For photosynthesis to work, the chloroplast needs a source of energy like sunlight and ingredients such as carbon dioxide and water. When light energy, carbon dioxide, and water are present, a chemical reaction takes place. Two different set-ups were prepared, Plant A and Plant B. Plant A was placed inside the box, hence, there is no air and sunlight. Plant B was placed outside the house with enough sunlight. After a week, the effect of sunlight on the growth and development of the plants was observed. Plant A, which is placed inside the box withered and died. While plant B with enough sunlight grew healthy. Therefore, it only proves that sunlight and a gas in the air has a great effect on the growth of a plant. Without sunlight and a gas from the air, plants can’t live nor grow to the fullest. Flow Chart Given Illustration Write your answer on the Flow Chart here.

Lakes containing D. magna have an average summer surface temperature of 20°C (Harper 1995) but may increase by more than 15% when expose to warm water effluent from power plants, paper mills, and chemical industry (Baker et al 2000). Could an increase in lake temperature caused by industrial thermal pollution affect the survivorship and reproduction of D. magna? We hypothesized that D. magna (study organism) populations reared in water temperatures ranging from 24-26 °C (independent variable) would have lower survivorship, higher (direction) male/female ratio among the offspring, and more female offspring carrying ephippia (dependent variables) as compared with D. magna grown in water temperatures of 20-22°C. Guide Questions: 1. Write a good title for the article. 2. Write the background of the study. 3. Write the question/problem. 4. Write the hypothesis.​​</a>

Earth is the only known planet where fire can burn.2. Water can be produced by fire.3. When a combustible material is heated, it burns.4. Candles should be placed near the windows with curtains so that it will light brightly.5. To look for fire-fighting equipment in an establishment, look for a square or rectangular signage with white pictogram in a red background.6. In case of fire you may not follow the circular signage with white pictogram in a blue background.7. Fire exit can be color red or green depending on the establishment.8. Class A fires can be put out by carbon dioxide.9. Among the stages of fire, the last stage which is the “decay stage” takes the longest time to finish.10. All fire extinguishers are multipurpose, meaning each one can put out all types of fire caused by any material.11. Fire is a thing, not an event.12. During microwave fire, the best thing to do is unplug or cut off the power and do not open the door or the windows.13. Assuming stable fuel, heat, and oxygen levels, a typical house fire isconstant in size every minute until the fire dies down.14. Using concentrated sunlight, ancient Greeks were able to start fire. A parabolic mirror that focuses solar rays is still used to ignite the Olympic torch.15. Smoking should not be done inside the bedroom.16. Burning pan should not be covered with lid, instead pour water.17. Oily rags can undergo spontaneous combustion, so store it in a cool and dry place.18. Use extension cord for your television when it is too far from the main outlet19. A small fire inside a glass container dies down when it is tightly covered.20.

The question should be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>can be answered through an experiment</strong>. After identifying the problem, one should <strong>gather pertinent data about the problem in order to come up with a tentative answer to the question</strong>. This tentative answer is known as the <strong>hypothesis</strong>. To prove or disprove the hypothesis, one has to <strong>conduct an experiment</strong>. The experiment will allow us to see the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In the situation given, we are trying to see the effect of sunlight on the growth of the plant. <strong>Results of the experiment are then gathered and analyzed.</strong> The analysis of results will either accept or reject the hypothesis. After the analysis of data, a conclusion is made. The <strong>conclusion</strong> is the answer to the question or problem. Also, the conclusion may lead us to more questions and problems, and the cycle repeats. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />

                            23. Activity 2: Rationale Directions: Read the article below and write the portion of the key element being identified Daphnia magna are small zooplankton found in freshwater inland lakes and are thought to switch their mode of reproduction from asexual to sexual in response to extreme temperatures (Mitchell 1999). Lakes containing D. magna have an average summer surface temperature of 20°C (Harper 1995) but may increase by more than 15% when expose to warm water effluent from power plants, paper mills, and chemical industry (Baker et al 2000). Could an increase in lake temperature caused by industrial thermal pollution affect the survivorship and reproduction of D. magna? We hypothesized that D. magna (study organism) populations reared in water temperatures ranging from 24-26 °C (independent variable) would have lower survivorship, higher (direction) male/female ratio among the offspring, and more female offspring carrying ephippia (dependent variables) as compared with D. magna grown in water temperatures of 20-22°C. Guide Questions: 1. Write a good title for the article. 2. Write the background of the study. 3. Write the question/problem. 4. Write the hypothesis.​​</h2><br />
