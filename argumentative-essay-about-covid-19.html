Right now, in the world we are in a fight of our lives against the coronavirus. It has affected many people including myself. I'm now at home every day and it really is affecting me socially. Not being able to speak to friends and see people I see on a regular basis is hard for me. Also, now that school is closed for the rest of the year it has really had an effect on my school life. I am not used to being at home all the time and working on the computer. I'm usually in a classroom surrounded by my peers.

In Detroit, which is one of the cities around the country hit hard by the virus, the pandemic has also affected the youth. Youth are now forced to stay home instead of going to school and spending time with friends. Most kids need to be outside and with people to release their energy and socialize. Now this cannot happen, because the virus has affected us so much. One thing we also see happening is food insecurities and social distancing. Due to what is happening in the world, people are very much afraid and cautious about food supply and interactions with people. People are afraid and are told to stay inside, so we stock up supplies that will last them about a month. Usually people get stuff that we will last them about two weeks, but now we need to stay home as much as we can.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>With social distancing, we now separate ourselves from other parts of society. This has made me feel very much disconnected from my friends. Humans are made to be out and about and socialize with beings on Earth. These unfortunate events have led many people to be disconnected from society. This has allowed my mind to go to the dark side, where my fears come out. My main fear is “How long will my life be on pause?” I’m afraid of how long I will be stuck in the house and can’t see my friends. Will it be a couple more weeks or will it be a couple months?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club has helped me a lot during this crisis.

So, I know for sure it helps other kids through these tough times. This experience with BGCSM virtually is helping lighten my heart, through my darkest time.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>THE ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY
</p><p>An argumentative essay is a piece of writing that takes a stance/ certain 
</p><p>position on an issue. 
</p><p>INTRODUCTION
</p><p>It is an effective way to start your essay by:
</p><p>• quoting an innovative idea
</p><p>• to use ultimate wisdom from a prominent person’s speech or life perspective
</p><p>• or a quote e.g. in a literature essay.
</p><p>• Use a proverb or a quote that would SUPPORT your opening statement.
</p><p>• Think of veterans’ writings, journals or articles e.g. Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi or 
</p><p>even brilliant authors and then link it to the topic.
</p><p>• THAT MEANS DEAR PROSPECTIVE, BRILLIANT WRITER- YOU MUST BE A READER 
</p><p>OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WROTE TO BECOME BRILLIANT IN WRITING.
</p><p>Types of arguments?
</p><p>The typical court case slam
</p><p>In a mythological novel like Percy Jackson, does Zeus have the right evidence to 
</p><p>persecute Percy Jackson and declare a war on the mortal world? 
</p><p>Something for the feminists: Is Annabeth a typical girl? (yah- the stereotyping game, 
</p><p>right?)
</p><p>All the above are examples of how an argumentative, (no 1 literature essay) could be 
</p><p>structured.
</p><p>Literature essays e.g.
</p><p>What did Shakespeare e.g. say about Hamlet- is he a procrastinator or not? /or how 
</p><p>does Claudius regard Hamlet’s appearance of gloom? As a pretence or real 
</p><p>madness?
</p><p>In a good argumentative essay, a writer attempts to persuade readers to 
</p><p>understand and support their point of view about a topic by stating their 
</p><p>reasoning and providing evidence to back it up. As you could see, 
</p><p>sometimes you get confronted with ridiculous arguments that you need to 
</p><p>reason about.
</p><p>How To Outline an Argumentative Essay in 4 Steps
</p><p>Argumentative essays should have a straightforward structure; so, they should 
</p><p>be easy for readers to follow. 
</p><p>The goal of an argumentative essay is to clearly outline a point of view also 
</p><p>called a hypothesis, 
</p><p>There must be clever reasoning, and supportive evidence. A good 
</p><p>argumentative essay should follow the following recommended structure:</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>When the first reports about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan appeared back in January, few people were able to predict how it was going to affect our lives on all levels. Now, a few months later, we still know very little about this virus – but medical professionals across the globe had more than enough opportunities to form the first impressions of what it is, how it influences human health and what we are to do about it. A lot of the information one can find about it right now is doubtful, inconsistent and often contradictory – however, it is not always the sign of deliberate misinformation. Just like with any other novel issue, there are no established opinions or 100 percent certain facts. Doctors are still finding things out and do it in the conditions of a crisis and constant overtime. It is no wonder that they often come to different conclusions – the body of information on SARS-CoV-2 is still too small. However, some things we do know. In this essay, we will mostly cover them and pay some attention to what possibly awaits us in future.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most disruptive global events in modern times. Since the first cases were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the virus has spread rapidly across the globe, causing widespread illness, death, and economic disruption. This essay will explore the COVID-19 pandemic using the informative, persuasive, and argumentative approaches.</p><p></p><p>Informative Essay:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, although some infected individuals may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. To slow the spread of the virus, public health officials have recommended measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and frequent hand washing. Vaccines have also been developed and are being administered around the world.</p><p></p><p>Persuasive Essay:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of individual and collective responsibility in protecting public health. While it may be inconvenient or uncomfortable to wear a mask or avoid large gatherings, these measures are critical to slowing the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immunocompromised. By following public health guidelines, we can help prevent the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.</p><p></p><p>Argumentative Essay:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many social and economic inequalities, including disparities in access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunity. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities such as low-income individuals and people of color, who are more likely to have pre-existing health conditions and work in jobs that do not allow for remote work. To address these inequalities, policymakers must take action to ensure that all individuals have access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources needed to weather the pandemic.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, both in terms of public health and the economy. By following public health guidelines and taking collective responsibility, we can help slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable populations. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for greater social and economic equity, which must be addressed through policy changes and systemic reforms.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p></p><p>Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems. Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.[3] Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.[4] Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.[5] Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.”[6] Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.[7] In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The new corona virus</strong> is a respiratory virus that spreads mainly through droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or droplets dripping from or out of the nose. It is unclear how long the virus that causes COVID-19 lasts in the upper extremities, but it looks similar to other corona bacteria. Studies show that corona bacteria can persist on the face for a few hours or up to a few days.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. A concerted effort is needed to stem the spread of the virus. Epidemics have been described as “the most common form of the disease and affect the greatest number of people.” The global epidemic was the H1N1 epidemic in 2009. The virus created by the novel corona virus first discovered in Wuhan, China, is now called corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) - 'CO' represents the corona, the 'VI' virus, and the 'D' virus.</p><p></p><p>The outbreak of corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has created a global health crisis that has profoundly affected the way we view our planet and our daily lives. The level of infection and transmission patterns not only threatens our well-being, but the safety measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus also require social exclusion by avoiding natural practices in humans, namely corporate comfort for others. Within this context of physical threat, social and physical confusion, and social alarm, what (and what could be) the role of various media channels in our lives at individual, social and social levels?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The media has long been regarded as a force for good in our modern world. This recognition goes hand in hand with the volume of research, which closely follows the steps of technological change (e.g. radio, movies, television, internet, cell phones) and zeitgeist (e.g. cold war, 9/11, climate change) in an attempt to map. the media has a huge impact on how we see ourselves, as individuals and citizens. Can the media (broadcasters and digitalis) still convey a sense of unity that reaches large audiences, or have messages lost to a noisy crowd on social media? Do the media offer comfort or reasons for misinformation, (de) harassment and discrimination? Can we use the flexibility and availability of media technology to increase public adherence to safety measures proposed by international health organizations to combat the spread of COVID-19? How can the various media industries and mass communication channels promote flexible responses to promote better health conditions and follow prevention strategies? How does the media affect the flexibility of the private sector (eg strengthening family ties compared to domestic violence and violence)? </p><p></p><br />

We issued guidance on immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provides guiding principles and considerations to support countries in their decision-making regarding provision of immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Government passed the Coronavirus Act 2020 (CA), which implemented a number of emergency powers, allowing public officials to take action in specific situations in order to contain and slow down the spread of the virus as well as ease the burden on frontline staff.[1] Examples of these emergency powers include: the capability for public officials to test, isolate, and detain a person where they have reasonable grounds to think that the person is infected; restrict or prohibit gatherings or events; and require the temporary closure of a school or registered childcare provider.[2]</p><p></p><p>In its efforts to support the public health benefit, the CA has arguably led to interference with individuals’ right to liberty under Article 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).[3] Pugh’s 2020 article on the CA discusses how individuals may be deprived of their liberty to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, if that deprivation is “necessary and proportionate” and is in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.[4] Pugh refers to this as “the public health exception”.[5] The importance of this approach directly relates to the consideration of a compulsory COVID-19 vaccine, specifically whether limitations on specific rights can be justified.</p><p></p><p>This essay analyzes whether a compulsory COVID-19 vaccine would be a violation of human rights law in the UK. For a comprehensive understanding of the implications of this topic, I provide background information and discuss perspectives regarding compulsory vaccinations in general. This discussion is followed by an outline of the specific rights under the ECHR that may be affected if a compulsory vaccination was to be implemented in the UK. I then discuss various interpretations of the elements required for state interference upon these rights and expand on them in regard to their application to compulsory vaccination. Through this analysis, it is concluded that a compulsory COVID-19 vaccination would not be a violation of human rights in the UK if the government sets out explicit parameters whereby a compulsory vaccination would be “necessary and proportionate” in the interests of health and safety, and if it was to ensure that the state is fulfilling its positive obligation to protect the right to life.[6]</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>try nopo ito</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Coronaviruses are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses that infect mammals and birds. They have the interesting property of assembling at intracellular membranes. About 20% of common colds in humans are caused by coronaviruses. More severe diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), are caused by novel coronaviruses that emerged from animal sources. Another novel coronavirus related to SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has spread globally, with significant mortality and economic impact. Much progress has been made in understanding the infectious diseases caused by human coronaviruses since the emergence of SARS and MERS. The animal sources, epidemiology, and types of infections have been well documented. However, there are still no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics for any human coronavirus infection.</p><p></p><p>This lack of treatment is due in part to an incomplete understanding of the basic biology of this family of viruses. Of particular interest is the unknown advantage of intracellular assembly and mechanism of virus egress from infected cells. These characteristics are potential untapped avenues for novel antiviral strategies. In this Special Issue of Cells, coronavirus infection will be examined from a cell biological perspective. Potential topics include virus entry, formation of replication organelles, genome replication and production of viral mRNA, synthesis and targeting of viral protiens,and assembly and budding in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and virion egress. How cells respond to coronavirus infection is another important potential topic, including how interferon-stimulated genes impact infection.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>make me brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.</p><p>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Although vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, if we continue to get vaccinated, we protect ourselves and those around us. If enough people are vaccinated, societies can develop herd immunity. The amount of people vaccinated to obtain herd immunity depends on the disease, but if this fraction is obtained, the spread of disease is contained. Through herd immunity, we protect those who may not be able to get vaccinated, such as people who are immunocompromised and the tiny portion of people for whom the vaccine is not effective.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>GOODLUCK!</p><br />

                            28. Argumentative essay about new variant of covid 19.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The emergence of new variants of COVID-19 has caused concern and uncertainty around the world. While some people argue that these variants are simply part of the natural evolution of the virus and not a cause for alarm, others believe that they pose a significant threat to public health and require urgent action.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, some argue that new variants of the virus are not unexpected and are simply a natural part of its evolution. Like many viruses, COVID-19 mutates over time as it replicates, and some of these mutations can lead to new variants with different characteristics. However, proponents of this view argue that the emergence of new variants does not necessarily mean that the virus is becoming more dangerous or that existing vaccines and treatments will be rendered ineffective.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are those who argue that new variants of COVID-19 represent a significant threat to public health and require urgent action. These individuals point to the fact that some of these variants are more transmissible than previous strains, meaning that they can spread more easily and rapidly within communities. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that some variants may be more resistant to existing vaccines and treatments, which could undermine efforts to control the spread of the virus.</p><p></p><p>Overall, it is clear that new variants of COVID-19 are a cause for concern, and it is important that we take them seriously. While it is true that these variants are a natural part of the virus's evolution, we cannot afford to be complacent in our response to them. Instead, we must continue to follow public health guidelines, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, to help slow the spread of the virus and prevent the emergence of new variants. Additionally, we must work to develop and distribute effective vaccines and treatments that can help protect people from the virus, including its new variants. Only by taking these actions can we hope to overcome this global health crisis and return to a sense of normalcy.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong (≧∇≦)/</p><p></p><br />
