WoundClot: The Science Behind Faster Healing  by UP Materials Science Society   It's Wisdom Wednesday!   Do you know what WoundClot does?   The WoundClot Gauze, is a single use, sterile, and bioabsorbable medical device that is fabricated to suit a variety of wounds. It is made from cellulose with a molecular structure designed to entrap platelets and coagulants in a modified physical molecular matrix, specifically designed to create this hemodynamic polymer membrane, with high adherence and resilience, able to withhold massive blood pressure and restrict blood flow almost immediately.    The ability to adhere to a bleeding wound reduces the amount of pressure needed in order to stop bleeding, thus preventing unnecessary damage the body caused by excessive pressure, or infection caused by prolonged contact with the wound. Next, platelets from the injury attach to the gauze by inter-molecular forces to form a stable membrane, which is able to withstand severe arterial and venous blood flow for hours.   At the same time, specifically designed molecular functional groups transform to enhance and activate the natural coagulation process. Coagulation is a complex chain reaction, where different elements are motivated into action, conditioned from other reactions.   Specific molecular groups, created in the manufacturing process, are then dispersed during gel formation to activate various coagulation factors in the blood, thus helping to form a physiologically natural fibrin clot in the wound. The ability to influence these reactions speeds the whole coagulation process.   After bleeding has stopped, the remaining residual membrane can be irrigated out of the wound safely without pulling on soft tissue or the existing clot. WoundClot is designed to maintain its integrity through polymeric chains, specifically designed to interact with water molecules to form a physical cross linked network, which is manageable and natural.</a>

                                            The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</a>

                            7. The Cask of AmontilladoBy Edgar Allan PoeTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had bome as I best could, but when heventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will notsuppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was apoint definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded theidea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed whenretribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause todoubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did notperceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point - this Fortunato - although in other regards he was a man tobe respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Fewitalians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit thetime and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. Inpainting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of oldwines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: -- was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I couldIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had beendrinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and hishead was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.​</h2><br />

WoundClot: The Science Behind Faster Healing 
by UP Materials Science Society
It's Wisdom Wednesday!
Do you know what WoundClot does?
The WoundClot Gauze, is a single use, sterile, and bioabsorbable medical device that is fabricated to suit a variety of wounds. It is made from cellulose with a molecular structure designed to entrap platelets and coagulants in a modified physical molecular matrix, specifically designed to create this hemodynamic polymer membrane, with high adherence and resilience, able to withhold massive blood pressure and restrict blood flow almost immediately.
The ability to adhere to a bleeding wound reduces the amount of pressure needed in order to stop bleeding, thus preventing unnecessary damage the body caused by excessive pressure, or infection caused by prolonged contact with the wound. Next, platelets from the injury attach to the gauze by inter-molecular forces to form a stable membrane, which is able to withstand severe arterial and venous blood flow for hours.
At the same time, specifically designed molecular functional groups transform to enhance and activate the natural coagulation process. Coagulation is a complex chain reaction, where different elements are motivated into action, conditioned from other reactions.
Specific molecular groups, created in the manufacturing process, are then dispersed during gel formation to activate various coagulation factors in the blood, thus helping to form a physiologically natural fibrin clot in the wound. The ability to influence these reactions speeds the whole coagulation process.
After bleeding has stopped, the remaining residual membrane can be irrigated out of the wound safely without pulling on soft tissue or the existing clot. WoundClot is designed to maintain its integrity through polymeric chains, specifically designed to interact with water molecules to form a physical cross linked network, which is manageable and natural.</h2><br />
