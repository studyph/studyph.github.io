MaramagThy glance, sweet maid, when first we met,Had left a heart that aches for thee,I feel the pain of fond regret—Thy heart, perchance, is not for me.We parted: though we met no more,My dreams are dreams of thee, fair maid;I think of thee, my thoughts imploreThe hours my lips on thine are laid.Forgive these words that love impart,And pleading, bare the poet’s breast;And if a rose with thorns thou art,Yet on my breast that rose may rest.I know not what to name thy charms,Thou art half human, half divine;And if I could hold thee in my arms,I know both heaven and earth were mine.​</a>

MY SCHOOL
I will tell you about
a place that is cool
it is without doubt
my dear old school.
C.
In school I can sing
and do many other things
I can read write and dance
I can skip, hop, and prance.
In school I have fun
I play under the sun
I count things I can see,
Dream of what I can be.
There's so much I can do
In my school, that's so true
It is after all, my home
Away from home.

I Sit and Sew
by Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson
I sit and sew—a useless task it seems,
My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams—
The panoply of war, the martial tred of men,
Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken
Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath—
But—I must sit and sew.
I sit and sew—my heart aches with desire—
That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
Once men. My soul in pity flings
Appealing cries, yearning only to go
There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe—
But—I must sit and sew.
The little useless seam, the idle patch;
Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream
That beckons me—this pretty futile seam,
It stifles me—God, must I sit and sew?

It tinctured every passing beam- He had his dream He labored hard and failed at last. His sails too weak to bear the blast. The raging tempests tore away And sent his beating bark astray But what cared he For wind or seat He said, "The tempest will be short My bark will come to port He saw through every cloud a gleam- He had his dream.B​.The man faced problems</a>

                                            Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</a>

The wandering airs they faint On the dark, the silent stream— The Champak odours fail Like sweet thoughts in a dream; The Nightingale's complaint, It dies upon her heart;— As I must on thine, Oh, belovèd as thou art! Oh lift me from the grass! I die! I faint! I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain On my lips and eyelids pale. My cheek is cold and white, alas! My heart beats loud and fast;— Oh! press it to thine own again, Where it will break at last. why is the poem entitled "the Indian Serenade"?Trace the emotional pattern of the poem.Is the second line of the last stanza an example of climax or anticlimax?Defend the arrangement of ideas in it. </a>

my dear old school.

In school I can sing
and do many other things
I can read write and dance
I can skip, hop, and prance.
In school I have fun
I play under the sun
I count things I can see,
Dream of what I can be.
There's so much I can do
In my school, that's so true
It is after all, my home
Away from home.

guide questions.
I Sit and Sew
by Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson
I sit and sew—a useless task it seems,
My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams—
The panoply of war, the martial tred of men,
Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken
Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath—
But—I must sit and sew.
I sit and sew—my heart aches with desire—
That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
Once men. My soul in pity flings
Appealing cries, yearning only to go
There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe—
But—I must sit and sew.
The little useless seam, the idle patch;
Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream
That beckons me—this pretty futile seam,
It stifles me—God, must I sit and sew?

                            23. Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</h2><br />

To thy chamber window, Sweet! The wandering airs they faint On the dark, the silent stream— The Champak odours fail Like sweet thoughts in a dream; The Nightingale's complaint, It dies upon her heart;— As I must on thine, Oh, belovèd as thou art! Oh lift me from the grass! I die! I faint! I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain On my lips and eyelids pale. My cheek is cold and white, alas! My heart beats loud and fast;— Oh! press it to thine own again, Where it will break at last. why is the poem entitled "the Indian Serenade"?Trace the emotional pattern of the poem.Is the second line of the last stanza an example of climax or anticlimax?Defend the arrangement of ideas in it. </h2><br />
