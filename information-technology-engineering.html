                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A microscope is an instrument that can be used to observe small objects, even cells. The image of an object is magnified through at least one lens in the microscope. This lens bends light toward the eye and makes an object appear larger than it actually is.</p><p></p><p>2. Microscopes are the tools that allow us to look more closely at objects, seeing beyond what is visible with the naked eye. Without them, we would have no idea about the existence of cells or how plants breathe or how rocks change over time.</p><p></p><p>3. For both inexperienced and experienced users, microscopes should always be handled with care. Proper microscope use will help prevent damage to the equipment and prevent laboratory accidents such as breaking slides.</p><br />
