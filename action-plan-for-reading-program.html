The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.

Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisine because people from all over the world visit them. Bali beaches are golden while those of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as the powder. _____________2. The lack of rain has horrible effects on farmers. With no rain, their land dries up, and it is very difficult to grow anything. When thecrops fall, the farmers have no choice but to get a second job in order to make the money they need. Farming is a full-time job. Many farmers end up selling their land. Some farmers have accepted the government program, The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). ___________________3. The school today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessonplans in the past were from printed materials while lessons of today are from books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. __________________4. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, coffee filter or cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, pre-filter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. Next, let thewater cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter bycrushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as the trap. Thiswill remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiledwater. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cottontrap.________________5.

Since smoking cigarettes harmsthe health of children, smokers in families were advised not to.The people were encouraged to plant more trees and otherplants in their yards in order that air around would be clearer.______________​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. My idea is to use recyclable materials that people in the baranggay no longer need such as old plastic bottles, jars, empty canisters and carton boxes which they can contribute in the program. </p><p></p><p>B. The design should be aesthetically pleasing and it should depend on the materials collected by the baranggay. The design must also be durable and practical. </p><p></p><p>C. Depending on the design, the materials used can be old plastic bottles, jars, canisters, carton boxes and other items that can be found in the baranggay. </p><p></p><p>D.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. The idea would be to organize a production line utilizing efficient methods of assembly and packaging to produce a large number of artistic plan pots using recyclable materials.</p><p></p><p>B. The design should be simple yet appealing, easy to replicate, and easily alterable to allow for a variety of unique creations. Simple motifs, geometric shapes, and bold colors are good choices for mass production.</p><p></p><p>C. Materials and supplies needed could include recycled plastic containers, paints, brushes, stencils, glue, markers, labels, and packaging materials.</p><p></p><p>D. To do it successfully, we could create an assembly line with multiple stages of production, including painting, labeling, and packaging. Production runs can be timed, and adjustments to the process can be made to increase output and minimize waste.</p><p></p><p>E. Seeking support for the program is essential, as it will require funds for materials, supplies, and labor. Partnerships with local businesses that have similar initiatives and seek to promote environmental sustainability can help expand the program and reach more people. Community volunteers can also be trained to assist in the production process, making the project more inclusive and engaging for everyone.</p><br />

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.

The school today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, the classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lessonplans in the past were from printed materials while lessons of today are from books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. __________________4. Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, coffee filter or cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, pre-filter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. Next, let thewater cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter bycrushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as the trap. Thiswill remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiledwater. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cottontrap.________________5.
