What is the significance of the town councilors commenting that the Happy Prince looks like a beggar by the end of the story? 4. What commentary about the class struggle can be gleaned from "The Happy Prince"? 5. What is the significance of the Happy Prince and the Swallow arriving in heaven?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. "The Happy Prince" demonstrates the class divide by portraying the stark contrast between the rich and the poor. The Happy Prince, a symbol of the wealthy and privileged, is located high above the town on a pedestal, adorned in gold leaf and jewels. Meanwhile, the poor and destitute live in squalor and misery at the base of the statue. The prince's privileged status is highlighted by his detachment from the struggles of the lower classes.</p><p></p><p>2. The Happy Prince attempts to bridge the gap between the upper and lower classes by enlisting the help of the swallow to distribute his jewels and gold to the poor and needy. The prince understands the suffering of the poor and feels a responsibility to help them, despite his privileged status.</p><p></p><p>3. The town councilors' comment that the Happy Prince looks like a beggar by the end of the story is significant because it demonstrates the transformative power of compassion and selflessness. The prince's initial superficial beauty and wealth are replaced by a deeper beauty, which comes from his self-sacrificing actions in service of others. The councilors, who initially admired the Happy Prince for his physical appearance and status, now recognize the true value of his selflessness and compassion.</p><p></p><p>4. "The Happy Prince" offers a poignant commentary on the class struggle by illustrating the stark contrast between the rich and the poor and highlighting the importance of compassion and selflessness. The story shows that wealth and privilege do not guarantee happiness and that true happiness comes from helping others and living a life of purpose and meaning.</p><p></p><p>5. The significance of the Happy Prince and the Swallow arriving in heaven is that their selfless actions have earned them a place in paradise. The story suggests that the highest value is placed on acts of kindness and generosity, rather than superficial beauty or material wealth. The Happy Prince and the Swallow's arrival in heaven represents the ultimate reward for their compassionate actions on earth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>i hope ur thanks to me hehe!</p><p></p><br />
