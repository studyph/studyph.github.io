In addition, there were two hundred diferent languages in Indonesia but ie existence of the hundred-odd languages is all related with the exception of West Irian. The Indonesians were able to sail by using their invention which is known as proa. Proa is a cance that can survive the deep seas near Indonesia. They went to different directions: north to the Philippines and Formosa, where Indonesian language are still spoken; west to the East African coast; to Madagascar, where Malayo-Polynesian dialects are still spoken; east to Polynesia, where the languages of Hawaii, Eastern Island, Samoa, Fiji and Tahiti are clearly related to Malay and Javanese and finally south to New Zealand and the lush green islands of Indonesia.

Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs. He soon made his way to the libre piled up in a corner of the window.

Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</a>

                            16. "April 15th, 1802" by Dorothy Wordsworth Thursday, 15th It was a threatening, misty morning, but mild We set off after dinner from Eusemere Mra. Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs. He soon made his way to the libre piled up in a corner of the window. He brought out a volume of Enfield's Speaker, another miscellany and an odd volume of Congreve's plays We had a glass of warm rum and water. We enjoyed ourselves and wished for Mary.

                            21. Read Introduction part-text types: classification, explanation.explanation, enumeration.and time order. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.Broadly speaking, there are two main text types, factual and literary. Within these are many more narrowly defined text types. Factual text types include such types as factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include such types as poetry, narrative or personal response.</p><p></p><p>2.Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.</p><br />
