The answer has to do with eternity, making peace with God and understanding the believer’s new identity in Christ. The NIV Quest Study Bible says Paul wrote this letter to believers in Ephesus (a city in modern-day Turkey) to encourage them to think of themselves in a whole new way. He wanted them to think of themselves not as people who had once been involved in idol worship, illicit sex, and foolish philosophies, but as people in Christ—people with a radically new identity. The book offers practical ways to live in unity with God and others. </p><p></p><p>#READYTOHELP </p><br />
