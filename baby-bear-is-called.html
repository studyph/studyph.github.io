                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

Both feed their babies milk and keep them secure in theirpouch until they are strong enough to survive their own.Topic:Main Idea:Supporting Details:Evidence:​</a>

Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</a>

                                            There are many different theories which explain how different life forms exist. In the mid-18th century, most people believed in creationism. Creationism held the idea that all forms of life were created in its present form and they remain unchanged since the beginning. Do you know that even the famous Carl von Linnaeus, the Father of Taxonomy, belleved in the fixity of species? (Source: Biology M15 Evolution, page 5) From the last lesson, we learned that fossil records, and developmental and molecular biology are possible evidences of evolution. To prove that evolution did exist, scientists travelled and explore the world and came up with their own theories. One of these is Charles Darwin Below is a story of Charles Darwin's journey in his voyage to Galapagos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Read the paragraph and try to answer the questions below. A long time ago, a small flock of sporrow-like birds called finches were blown out to sea by a fierce storm They lost their bearings but flew on in search of the mainlond, going further and further out to sea. At the point of exhaustion, 600 miles from home, they spotted a speck of land - an island in the middle of the sea. They were saved and could rest, drink and feed before returning home But this island was perfect: It had abundant seeds and other food, plenty of shelter, nesting sites and amazingly) no predators or other birds to compete with life was much harder on the mainland. There was no need for the birds to move on. Their numbers grew - until they became just a bit too numerous for the little island. Some found it hard to find enough food for themselves or their offspring, and young birds were driven away from areas where food was available. Some birds were forced to fly across the seo to nearby islands. There, they found new territories, also with no predators or other birds to compete with As the plants and their seeds were just a little different on each island, some birds were better than others at finding and eating the new food sources Birds which could break open fruits and eat the seeds survived well enough to produce lots of babies. Eventually, after a very long time, all the islands became occupied by these birds but the finches on each island were shghtly different Learning Task 1. Guide Questions: 1. Explain why it is unlikely that more than one flock of birds would find the islands in this way at the same time? 2. Suggest two possible reasons why there were no predators on the island 3. Why were there no other birds to compete with? (see 01) 4. Why might some finches survive better than others on the same food sources? 5. Why were the finches slightly different on each island?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.<strong>Color – the most obvious difference is this one as polar bears appear to be bright white in color (even though their skin is black) while most other bears are usually brown or black. ... Most other bears will only weigh in somewhere between 400 and 800 pounds while polar bears are known to weigh up to 1,500 pounds.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>are </strong><strong>cool </strong><strong>And </strong><strong>strong</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bears</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Dens provide winter shelter for hibernating bears and are not year-round homes, contrary to the cartoonish image of a cave – the entrance littered with bones – that's often portrayed. Roots, rock crevices, hollow trees and even buildings provide shelter for hibernating bears.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> Bears hibernate during winter, but aren't sleeping the whole time. Hibernation for bears simply means they don't need to eat or drink, and rarely urinate or defecate (or not at all). There is strong evolutionary pressure for bears to stay in their dens during winter, if there is little or no food available.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Hibernation is a state of minimal activity and metabolic depression. Hibernation is a seasonal heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature, slow breathing and heart-rate, and low metabolic rate.

                            5. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            9. Read the text carefully. Evaluate the claims with the writer's logos, ethos, and pathos. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In this text, the writer uses logos by providing factual information, such as the National Geographic report and the statistics about the space polar bears have in zoos compared to the wild. The writer also uses ethos by citing sources such as PETA and the BBC to support their argument. Finally, the writer uses pathos by evoking emotion through their description of the death of Marius the giraffe and the psychological effects of captivity on zoo animals.</p><br />

                            14. There are many different theories which explain how different life forms exist. In the mid-18th century, most people believed in creationism. Creationism held the idea that all forms of life were created in its present form and they remain unchanged since the beginning. Do you know that even the famous Carl von Linnaeus, the Father of Taxonomy, belleved in the fixity of species? (Source: Biology M15 Evolution, page 5) From the last lesson, we learned that fossil records, and developmental and molecular biology are possible evidences of evolution. To prove that evolution did exist, scientists travelled and explore the world and came up with their own theories. One of these is Charles Darwin Below is a story of Charles Darwin's journey in his voyage to Galapagos Island in the Pacific Ocean. Read the paragraph and try to answer the questions below. A long time ago, a small flock of sporrow-like birds called finches were blown out to sea by a fierce storm They lost their bearings but flew on in search of the mainlond, going further and further out to sea. At the point of exhaustion, 600 miles from home, they spotted a speck of land - an island in the middle of the sea. They were saved and could rest, drink and feed before returning home But this island was perfect: It had abundant seeds and other food, plenty of shelter, nesting sites and amazingly) no predators or other birds to compete with life was much harder on the mainland. There was no need for the birds to move on. Their numbers grew - until they became just a bit too numerous for the little island. Some found it hard to find enough food for themselves or their offspring, and young birds were driven away from areas where food was available. Some birds were forced to fly across the seo to nearby islands. There, they found new territories, also with no predators or other birds to compete with As the plants and their seeds were just a little different on each island, some birds were better than others at finding and eating the new food sources Birds which could break open fruits and eat the seeds survived well enough to produce lots of babies. Eventually, after a very long time, all the islands became occupied by these birds but the finches on each island were shghtly different Learning Task 1. Guide Questions: 1. Explain why it is unlikely that more than one flock of birds would find the islands in this way at the same time? 2. Suggest two possible reasons why there were no predators on the island 3. Why were there no other birds to compete with? (see 01) 4. Why might some finches survive better than others on the same food sources? 5. Why were the finches slightly different on each island?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Because this island was perfect, it had abundant seeds and other food, plenty of shelter, nesting sites and amazingly no predators or other birds to complete with.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. True</p><p>2. True</p><p>3. True</p><p>4. False — ovaries produces the egg cells. Testes is the one responsible for the synthesis of sperm cells. </p><p>5. True</p><p>6. False — boys are not capable to bear a child because they do not have the necessary organs in which an embryo can grow.</p><p>7. True</p><p> </p>Answers:<p> </p><p>1. Testosterone is important in the first stages of developing the male reproductive organs in a foetus. It also causes the development of male characteristics such as growth of facial hair, deepening of the voice and the growth spurt that takes place during puberty.</p><p></p><p>2. The reproductive system is responsible for producing offspring. The kidneys are responsible for removing waste.</p><p></p><p>3. The vagina is the passageway through which fluid passes out of the body during menstrual periods . It is also called the birth canal . The vagina connects the cervix (the opening of the womb, or uterus ) and the vulva (the external genitalia).</p><p></p><p>4. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones. Fallopian tubes: These are narrow tubes that are attached to the upper part of the uterus and serve as pathways for the ova (egg cells) to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. Fertilization of an egg by a sperm normally occurs in the fallopian tubes.</p><p></p><p>5. When the male ejaculates (when semen leaves the penis), a small amount of semen is deposited into the vagina. Millions of sperm are in this small amount of semen, and they "swim" up from the vagina through the cervix and uterus to meet the egg in the fallopian tube. It takes only one sperm to fertilize the egg.</p><p></p><p>6. But exceptions are common. Many men with low sperm counts or abnormal semen are still fertile. And about 15% of infertile men have normal semen and plenty of normal sperm. Surprisingly, the complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia), can be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>7.
