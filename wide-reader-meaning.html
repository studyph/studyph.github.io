Direction: Read each short passage very carefully. Infer the specific place they are referring to.
Passage 1:
 I hear a loud “thwack” as the ball leaves the ballpark and the crowd roars with cheers!
Can you infer where I am?

Passage 2:
 I see bubbles rising. I hear my own breathing. I love those colourful fish swimming above
me. I feel the seaweed swaying.
Can you infer where I am?

 This area is so silent. The people here are all looking for books, while some are sitting
on a wide table doing their assignments. I love this place so much. I could choose a book
and borrow it if necessary.

Passage 4:
 I hear people screaming. I can see many items on sale. Foods are everywhere as
well. There are lot of rides you can choose for. Oh, I’m getting so excited for the next ride!
Can you infer where I am?

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 2. As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992). These interactive practices appear to draw upon and enhance interactional and writing skills. A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 3. The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

                                            B. The Philippine Eagle The Philippine Eagle has replaced the maya as our national bird. It is one of the three largest and strongest eagles in the world. But it is in danger of extinction. Hunting and deforestation have caused the number of Philippine Eagles to dwindle. Scientists have tried to increase their number by breeding them in captivity. The first eagle to be bred in captivity is Pag-asa. At 25 years old, Pag-asa is not yet suited to be released to the wild as she has developed dependency on her human keeper. 89 words 8.

                                            LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</a>

The use of intertextuality in literary work is easy to identify even if thereader does not possess a wide knowledge of different literary textsand materials.2. Intertextuality happens when a text or any work of art is indirectly ordirectly referring to another text or work of art through its genre,symbols, ideas, or even style.3. The term intertextuality was first developed by the poststructuralistJulia Klarete in the 1960s.4. An implicit intertextual reference happens when the writer directlyalludes to another text through the genre, ideas, symbols and styles.5. Explicit intertextual reference happens when the writer indirectlystates quotes or reference another text in their work.6. The use of intertextuality has given writers the potentials to enrichand extend the meanings of their literary work and reflect theirperspectives on issues or message in a more creative manner.7. Intertextuality variations depend on two factors: the intention of thesignificance and the writer's reference.8. Optional intertextuality creates bigger impact on the significance ofthe intertext within the work of literature.9. Accidental intertextuality happens when readers connect a text withanother text, cultural practice, or a personal experience without anytangible anchor point within the original text.10. Obligatory intertextuality is done unconsciously and inflicteddirectly by the writer to help enrich and extend the meanings of theirliterary work.11. Adaptation is the ‘reworking' or the ‘re-imagination' of a well-knownwork of art or a piece of literature to change or extend its meanings.12. Parody is simply referred to by most literary scholars as‘intellectually humorous imitation' of a work of art or literature.13. Appropriation technique refers to the use of direct reference toanother text with the use of famous lines.14. Allusion is commonly used in intertextuality where an indirectreference to another text through characters, symbols, and ideas areused to extend meaning.15. Adaptation is a technique common in TV damas or stage plays wherethe stories are largely based on popular literary works such as novelsand short stories.​</a>

                                            The Philippine Eagle
The Philippine Eagle has replaced the maya as our national bird. It is one of the three largest and strongest eagles in the world. But it is in danger of extinction. Hunting and deforestation have caused the number of Philippine Eagles to dwindle. Scientists have tried to increase their number by breeding them in captivity. The first eagle to be bred in captivity is Pag-asa. At 25 years old, Pag-asa is not yet suited to be released to the wild as she has developed dependency on her human keeper

Passage 1:
 I hear a loud “thwack” as the ball leaves the ballpark and the crowd roars with cheers!
Can you infer where I am?

 I see bubbles rising. I hear my own breathing. I love those colourful fish swimming above
me. I feel the seaweed swaying.
Can you infer where I am?

 This area is so silent. The people here are all looking for books, while some are sitting
on a wide table doing their assignments. I love this place so much. I could choose a book
and borrow it if necessary.
Can you infer where I am?

Passage 4:
 I hear people screaming. I can see many items on sale. Foods are everywhere as
well. There are lot of rides you can choose for. Oh, I’m getting so excited for the next ride!
Can you infer where I am?

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.

A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 2. As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992). These interactive practices appear to draw upon and enhance interactional and writing skills. A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 3. The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

                            11. LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</h2><br />
