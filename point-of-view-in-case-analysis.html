                    <p>Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A&#039;s defense lawyer argued on A&#039;s behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</p>

1. Surveys and questionnaires are 2 similar tools used in collecting primary data,
2. The researcher uses observation as a scientific tool and method of data
collection
3. An experiment is a structured study where the researchers attempt to understand
the causes, effects, and processes involved in a particular process.
4. Collecting your own data allows you the freedom to address issues specific to
your business, or research aim. In this case, the data collected is exactly what the researcher wants
and needs.
5. The data collected from primary sources are up-to date, unlike that of the
secondary sources. It collects data in real-time and does not take information from stale and outdated
sources
6. The data collection process for primary data is very expensive. No matter how
little the research is, at least one professional researcher will need to be employed to carry out the
research.
_7. The different sources of primary data collection are designed in a way that the
data collected are tailored to the specific research needs.
_8. Secondary data analysis is the process of analyzing data collected from another
researcher who primarily
collected this data for another purpose.
9. A research design is serving as a guide for the secondary data analysis.
10. The data is evaluated to ensure that it really addresses the statement of the
problem and answers the research questions.
11. Secondary data mostly require little to no cost for people to them
12. When re-evaluating data, especially through another person's lens or point of
view, new things are uncovered.
13. The data collected through secondary sources may not be as authentic as when
collected directly from the source.
14. Some data sources are known to exaggerate the information that is being shared.
15. Researchers spend so much time surfing through a pool of irrelevant data before finally
getting the one they need.</a>

                            1. Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</h2><br />

</p><p></p><p>                -Kleptomania cannot be considered a legal defense to stealing – not even an insanity defense. Individuals are held responsible for their actions unless it can be clearly proven that they completely lack a sense self-control. The sentence is usually less time for a mental institution than a prison sentence.

2. The researcher uses observation as a scientific tool and method of data
collection
3. An experiment is a structured study where the researchers attempt to understand
the causes, effects, and processes involved in a particular process.
4. Collecting your own data allows you the freedom to address issues specific to
your business, or research aim. In this case, the data collected is exactly what the researcher wants
and needs.

secondary sources. It collects data in real-time and does not take information from stale and outdated
sources
6. The data collection process for primary data is very expensive. No matter how
little the research is, at least one professional researcher will need to be employed to carry out the
research.
_7. The different sources of primary data collection are designed in a way that the
data collected are tailored to the specific research needs.
_8. Secondary data analysis is the process of analyzing data collected from another
researcher who primarily
collected this data for another purpose.
9. A research design is serving as a guide for the secondary data analysis.
