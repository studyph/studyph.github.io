                                            ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.

                                            The water-clock marks the hour in the Ta-chung sz’,—in
the Tower of the Great Bell: now the mallet is lifted to
smite the lips of the metal monster,—the vast lips inscribed with
Buddhist texts from the sacred Fa-hwa-King, from the chapters of the holy Ling-yen-King! Hear the great bell responding!
—how mighty her voice, though tongueless!—KO-NGAI! All
the little dragons on the high-tilted eaves of the green roofs
shiver to the tips of their gilded tails under that deep wave of
sound; all the porcelain gargoyles tremble on their carven
perches; all the hundred little bells of the pagodas quiver with
desire to speak. KO-NGAI!—all the green-and-gold tiles of
the temple are vibrating; the wooden gold-fish above them are
writhing against the sky; the uplifted finger of Fo shakes high
over the heads of the worshippers through the blue fog of incense! KO-NGAI!—What a thunder tone was that! All the
lacquered goblins on the palace cornices wriggle their firecolored tongues! And after each huge shock, how wondrous
the multiple echo and the great golden moan and, at last, the
sudden sibilant sobbing in the ears when the immense tone
faints away in broken whispers of silver,—as though a woman
should whisper, “Hiai!” Even so the great bell hath sounded
every day for wellnigh five hundred years,—Ko-Ngai: first with
stupendous clang, then with immeasurable moan of gold, then
with silver murmuring of “Hiai!” And there is not a child in all
the many-colored ways of the old Chinese city who does not
know the story of the great bell,—who cannot tell you why the
great bell says Ko-Ngai and Hiai!
Now, this is the story of the great bell in the Ta-chung sz’,
as the same is related in the Pe-Hiao-Tou-Choue, written by the
learned Yu-Pao-Tchen, of the City of Kwang-tchau-fu.
Nearly five hundred years ago the Celestially August, the
Son of Heaven, Yong-Lo, of the “Illustrious,” or Ming, dynasty, commanded the worthy official Kouan-Yu that he
should have a bell made of such size that the sound thereof
might be heard for one hundred li. PA REACT NAMN PO 7 TO 9 SENTENCE PO SANA SANA PO MATULUNGAN NYU PO AKO</a>

Fill in the blanks with the correct adjectives in series based on the article. Follow the suggested kinds of adjectives in the parenthesis. In the year 884 BC, there were several fierce wars raging among the states of ancient Greece. Hoping for peace, one of the young brave male rulers of the states, King Iphitos of Elis, proposed that the games be held that would please the gods and therefore restore peace to the land. The games he referred to are what we know today as the Olympic Games, The symbol of the Olympic games is a series or five colorful rings. The rings are linked together from left to right. This symbol represents the union of 5 continents (Asia, Australia, Europe, the Americas and Africa) and joining together of athletes from around the world. During the Olympic games, a sacred orange sulfur flame was set to burn continuously on the gigantic metal altor of Zeus in Olympia. Since then, the flame is relit cach time the games are held.

 Summary
king midas was found of gold more than anything else in the world. he
treasured his royal crown because it was made of that precious metal. if
she loved anything good or half as good, it was a little girl who played
 around her father's feet so happily. but the more midas loved his daughter, the more he desired wealth.
he thought the foolish man that he was, the best thing he could possibly do
for his beloved child was to bestow upon him the great pile of yellow shiny
 coins that had beencollected since the creation of the world. so ge gave
all his thought and and all his time to this one cause. if ever he looked for a
moment at the golden clouds of sunset, he wished they were gold and that
they could be safely squeezed into his strong box.</a>

There was a farmer named Gopl, who lived in a village. Ho possessed fow acres of land. He was digging the field on a hot summer noon, when he hit something He went on digging and found a metal pot. The pot was so huge that one could cook rice for 100 people in it. Gopi thought it wasn't of any use and went on digging. He got tired after digging for so long and out of frustration threw the pot and the spade. After that he sat under a tree to rest. When he was about to leave, he saw something unbelievable. He found around a hundred spades inside the big pot. He was overwhelmed with joy over his good fortune. This made him think it was a 'magic pot. He then decided to keep a mango in it. Within fraction of seconds, he was amazed to see hundred mangoes inside. He took the pot with him and kept it in a secret place in his house. He started putting things in the pot that turned hundred folds. With time he became very rich and soon the king came to know about it. The king inquired about the pot and wanted it to be in his treasury, if it was something valuable. The king did not know what to do when the pot was brought to him. While trying to peep inside it, he accidentally fell in. Upon climbing up he was shocked to find hundreds of kings around him. All of them started climbing up the throne and fighting among themselves. The king eventually died of shock. The farmer accounted that out of curiosity the king had killed himself and left the pot in the king's treasury. Attitude  Characters  Gender​</a>

                            7. ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.

                            14. The water-clock marks the hour in the Ta-chung sz’,—in
the Tower of the Great Bell: now the mallet is lifted to
smite the lips of the metal monster,—the vast lips inscribed with
Buddhist texts from the sacred Fa-hwa-King, from the chapters of the holy Ling-yen-King! Hear the great bell responding!
—how mighty her voice, though tongueless!—KO-NGAI! All
the little dragons on the high-tilted eaves of the green roofs
shiver to the tips of their gilded tails under that deep wave of
sound; all the porcelain gargoyles tremble on their carven
perches; all the hundred little bells of the pagodas quiver with
desire to speak. KO-NGAI!—all the green-and-gold tiles of
the temple are vibrating; the wooden gold-fish above them are
writhing against the sky; the uplifted finger of Fo shakes high
over the heads of the worshippers through the blue fog of incense! KO-NGAI!—What a thunder tone was that! All the
lacquered goblins on the palace cornices wriggle their firecolored tongues! And after each huge shock, how wondrous
the multiple echo and the great golden moan and, at last, the
sudden sibilant sobbing in the ears when the immense tone
faints away in broken whispers of silver,—as though a woman
should whisper, “Hiai!” Even so the great bell hath sounded
every day for wellnigh five hundred years,—Ko-Ngai: first with
stupendous clang, then with immeasurable moan of gold, then
with silver murmuring of “Hiai!” And there is not a child in all
the many-colored ways of the old Chinese city who does not
know the story of the great bell,—who cannot tell you why the
great bell says Ko-Ngai and Hiai!
Now, this is the story of the great bell in the Ta-chung sz’,
as the same is related in the Pe-Hiao-Tou-Choue, written by the
learned Yu-Pao-Tchen, of the City of Kwang-tchau-fu.
Nearly five hundred years ago the Celestially August, the
Son of Heaven, Yong-Lo, of the “Illustrious,” or Ming, dynasty, commanded the worthy official Kouan-Yu that he
should have a bell made of such size that the sound thereof
might be heard for one hundred li. PA REACT NAMN PO 7 TO 9 SENTENCE PO SANA SANA PO MATULUNGAN NYU PO AKO</h2><br />

The games he referred to are what we know today as the Olympic Games, The symbol of the Olympic games is a series or five colorful rings. The rings are linked together from left to right. This symbol represents the union of 5 continents (Asia, Australia, Europe, the Americas and Africa) and joining together of athletes from around the world. During the Olympic games, a sacred orange sulfur flame was set to burn continuously on the gigantic metal altor of Zeus in Olympia. Since then, the flame is relit cach time the games are held. The flame is extinguished only at the end of all the games. The Olympic motto is " citius, altius, fortius" meaning "swifter, higher, stronger". ​</h2><br />

 Summary
king midas was found of gold more than anything else in the world. he
treasured his royal crown because it was made of that precious metal. if
she loved anything good or half as good, it was a little girl who played
 around her father's feet so happily. but the more midas loved his daughter, the more he desired wealth.
he thought the foolish man that he was, the best thing he could possibly do
for his beloved child was to bestow upon him the great pile of yellow shiny
 coins that had beencollected since the creation of the world. so ge gave
all his thought and and all his time to this one cause. if ever he looked for a
moment at the golden clouds of sunset, he wished they were gold and that
they could be safely squeezed into his strong box.</h2><br />
                        <p>One day a strange man appeared at the gates of the palace. He offered</p><p>Midas a deal. If Midas agreed to whatever he said, he would grant him</p><p>one wish. Midas didn't hesitate and asked that everything he touched would turn to gold. The strange man granted his wish and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Midas rejoiced at the thought of all the wealth he could amass and immediately began testing his new power. But to his dismay, his daughter, his food, and even his beloved crown all turned to gold. He soon realized that his wish was a curse, for he could no longer show love to his daughter, eat or even wear his crown.</p><p></p><p>In despair, Midas prayed to the gods for help. He was told to go bathe in the river Pactolus to be freed from the curse. Midas did as he was told and the waters of the Pactolus turned to gold, thus giving rise to the term "riches of the Pactolus". Freed from his curse, Midas regained his humanity and returned to his life of love and happiness.</p><br />

                            27. Practice Task 2 Read the story below and fill out the table below. Write your answer on your answer sheet. There was a farmer named Gopl, who lived in a village. Ho possessed fow acres of land. He was digging the field on a hot summer noon, when he hit something He went on digging and found a metal pot. The pot was so huge that one could cook rice for 100 people in it. Gopi thought it wasn't of any use and went on digging. He got tired after digging for so long and out of frustration threw the pot and the spade. After that he sat under a tree to rest. When he was about to leave, he saw something unbelievable. He found around a hundred spades inside the big pot. He was overwhelmed with joy over his good fortune. This made him think it was a 'magic pot. He then decided to keep a mango in it. Within fraction of seconds, he was amazed to see hundred mangoes inside. He took the pot with him and kept it in a secret place in his house. He started putting things in the pot that turned hundred folds. With time he became very rich and soon the king came to know about it. The king inquired about the pot and wanted it to be in his treasury, if it was something valuable. The king did not know what to do when the pot was brought to him. While trying to peep inside it, he accidentally fell in. Upon climbing up he was shocked to find hundreds of kings around him. All of them started climbing up the throne and fighting among themselves. The king eventually died of shock. The farmer accounted that out of curiosity the king had killed himself and left the pot in the king's treasury. Attitude  Characters  Gender​</h2><br />

Like they said though:
You can take a man out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the man
Mga kababayan, turn up!
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
Walang tatalo sa bagsik
Ng ating dugo
Isigaw ng malakas ang
Ating panalo
Wag nang pagusapan
Ang mga negatibong pangyayari
San mang panig ka
Nasa mundo
Kinabukasan na natin 'to
Panalo!
Yeah
Keep runnin' ya mouth when you lyin'
I stay on my business while watchin' you dyin'
I'm takin' my people to heights while you cryin'
Bout regular livin' &amp; that's what I'm tryna
Prove, 'stead of just lyin' in booths
First true Filipino rapper on the news
Sit, enjoy it if ya' cool
Haters can snooze
While I put my city on the map
22-double the Olongapo City no cap
Never forgettin' the street where my
Cousin would sit when we always just listen to rap
Kendrick, Em, &amp; A$AP with some metal
And man we would turn up with that
Been mundane till the sun came
Now I want fame like a kid in the trap uh
Aye
I been in Spain (Spain)
But the letter 'S' is silent (pain)
I'm claimin' my reign like a king
So I can water crops for survivin' (rain rain)
Go away if you trippin' (yuh)
Had a homie he was Cripn' (cuh)
Ain't got no love for the people
Who talk over songs when they
Claimin' they listen (listen listen)
These bars - never done, uh
3 stars and a sun, aye
Blue, red draped down on a flag
No we never fear none
Most of us didn't grow up with a trust fund
Know that I'm willin' to kill for a loved one
I'm on the move from a nothin' to someone
Reminding my people to shout:
Tayo ay Pilipino
Kahit anong kulay ng balat
Isasapuso
Mapa-Tagalog, Bisaya, o Ilokano
