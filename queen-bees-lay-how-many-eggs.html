Honeybees live together in colonies made up of hives that have many chambers and cells. Each colony has three types of honeybee: the queen bee, the worker bees and drones. The queen bee lays eggs. Worker bees are females that do not lay eggs. They build and repair the hives, gather food and defend the hive. Drones are male bees whose job is to mate with the queen. 	Termites live in common. Each colony consists of a large nest made up of chambers and cells. Termite colonies are also of three types. The king termite leads the colony. The queen mate with the king termite to produce eggs. Worker termites build and repair the nest and take care of all other termites. Soldier termites defend the nest. ​</a>

                                            An average bee hive consists of about 20,000 bees within the colony. Within the colony, there are three types of bees and each has its own important job. There is only one queen bee in the hive, and her only job is to fill the hive with eggs. A queen will lay about 1,500 eggs a day. Male bees are called drones. Their only job to mate with the queen. Worker bees, on the other hand, are extremely busy. There are female bees that lay no eggs. They tend the hive by taking care of the babies, building honeycombs, and keeping the hive cool. Some worker bees also leave the hive to go and collect nectar and pollen.3 supporting details​</a>

                            11. Read the paragraphs and make an outline. Honeybees live together in colonies made up of hives that have many chambers and cells. Each colony has three types of honeybee: the queen bee, the worker bees and drones. The queen lays eggs. Worker bees are fem ales that do not lay eggs. They build and repair the hives, gather food and defend the hive. Drones are male bees whose job is to mate with the queen Termites live in colonies. Each colony consists of a large nest made up of chambers and cells. Termite colonies are also of three types. The king and queen make up one type. They mate together to produce eggs.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Her function in the hive is one of production. She is normally the only reproductive female in the colony. Egg-laying begins in early spring, initiated when the first fresh pollen is brought home by the workers. Egg production will continue until fall, or as long as pollen is available.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the height of her productivity, the queen could lay as many as 2000 eggs each day. A queen bee can live for up to five years, but her period of usefulness rarely exceeds two or three years. Younger queens produce many more eggs, and older ones may produce excessive drones. Many beekeepers re-queen their colonies every year or two. Older queens are often superseded (replaced) by the workers without any assistance, or even knowledge, of the beekeeper. Good quality queens can be reared by an experienced beekeeper, but a beginner will usually do better to buy good queens from a reputable producer.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>pwede po ako e brainlist po ako plsssana maka tolong ako<br />

                        How many eggs can a hen lay?<p></p><p><strong>Hen</strong> refers to a female chicken typically over a year old or mainly a female bird.</p><p></p><p>An adult female chicken can only lay <strong>one</strong> <strong>egg per day</strong> and will take some days when it does not lay an egg at all. </p><p></p><p>This laying schedule is due to the hen's  reproductive system. A hen's bodily system begins forming an egg shortly after the previous egg is laid, and it takes 26 hours for an egg to eventually form again.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#AnswerforTrees</p><p>#BrainlyOnlineLearning</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p></p><p></p><br />
