The researchers leamed that having no time for opening social media application due tolots of tasks either academic or household chores is not the effect of integrating socialmedia for educational purposes.2. 2. The most frequent reasons of teachers why they are motivated to use social media foreducational purposes are- they just want to be updated on the school happeningsand to communicate with other faculty members and school administrator, and ifneeded only in their concems with tasks.Conclusions:1. The researchers come up with a conclusion that the effect of social media's utilizationfor educational purposes in terms of personal aspects, students can be able to search/gather information or ideas about certain issues.2. The researchers concluded that the least effect to students of integrating social media foreducational purposes is lack of time for opening social media application due to lots ofhousehold chores and academic tasks.Recommendations: (pasagot po) 1.2.</a>

In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.

Situation Issues, polls, data, data interpretations and surveys are very accessible nowadays because of the internet. Sometimes we cannot even distinguish if these come from reliable sources or not. One way to understand issues is to conduct our own research to help other people to increase their awareness, especially on social issues. Conducting research enhances our knowledge and allows us to find ways on how to best address these issues or problems within our community or in our country.
Product / Performance / Purpose Things to do in conducting mini research.
1. Choose one topic (school, community or in our country) of interest where you can apply any of the measures of position. It can be an existing data from a reliable source.
2. Gather at least 30 observations about the topic.
3. Give a short background on the topic.
4. Mention the significance of solving and interpreting the results of the measures if positions in the context of the problem.
5. Present the data you gathered in a table by making a frequency distribution table.
6. Specify at least three relevant points in any measures of position that you will use. Interpret these measures in the context of the problem.</a>

COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S proteinon its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, S1 and52. Si contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) which allowscoronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2then likely plays a role in membrane fusion,14.

In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.

                            27. Pls answer i needs it too much 
Situation Issues, polls, data, data interpretations and surveys are very accessible nowadays because of the internet. Sometimes we cannot even distinguish if these come from reliable sources or not. One way to understand issues is to conduct our own research to help other people to increase their awareness, especially on social issues. Conducting research enhances our knowledge and allows us to find ways on how to best address these issues or problems within our community or in our country.
Product / Performance / Purpose Things to do in conducting mini research.
1. Choose one topic (school, community or in our country) of interest where you can apply any of the measures of position. It can be an existing data from a reliable source.
2. Gather at least 30 observations about the topic.
3. Give a short background on the topic.
4. Mention the significance of solving and interpreting the results of the measures if positions in the context of the problem.
5. Present the data you gathered in a table by making a frequency distribution table.
6. Specify at least three relevant points in any measures of position that you will use. Interpret these measures in the context of the problem.</h2><br />

Direction: Identify what kind of text type is the followingparagraphEncircle the letter of the correct answerResearchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show thatcoronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction withangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect humancells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (s) glycoprotein binds to thecell membrane protein anglotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enterhuman cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S proteinon its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, S1 and52. Si contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) which allowscoronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2then likely plays a role in membrane fusion,14.
