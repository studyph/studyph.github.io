The Downside of Work-Life Balance
By James Clear
One way to think about work-life balance is with a concept known as The Four
Burners Theory. Here's how it was first explained to me:
Imagine that your life is represented by a stove with four burners on it. Each
bumer symbolizes one major quadrant of your life
1. The first burner represents your family
2. The second burner is your friends
3. The third burner is your health
4. The fourth bumer is your work.
The Four Burners Theory says that in order to be successful you have to cut off one
of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two."
Three Views of the Four Burners
My initial reaction to The Four Burners Theory was to search for a way to
bypass it. "Can I succeed and keep all four burners running? I wondered
Perhaps I could combine two burners. What if I lumped family and friends into
one category
Maybe I could combine health and work. "1 hear sitting all day is unhealthy
What if I got a standing desk? Now, I know what you are thinking. Believing that you
will be healthy because you bought a standing desk is like believing you are a rebel
because you ignored the fasten seatbelt sign on an airplane, but whatever
Soon I realized I was inventing these workarounds because I didn't want to face
the real issue: life is filed with tradeoffs. If you want to excel in your work and in your
marriage, then your friends and your health may have to suffer. If you want to be
healthy and succeed as a parent, then you might be forced to dial back your career
ambitions. Of course, you are free to divide your time equally among all four burners,
but you have to accept that you will never reach your full potential in any given area.
Essentially, we are forced to choose. Would you rather live a life that is
unbalanced, but high-performing in a certain area? Or would you rather live a life that
is balanced, but never maximizes your potential in a given quadrant?

The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</a>

However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government. Among these, (9) contributes the most impact on one’s personal development because the crucial and intense socialization happens with it.

(14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior.

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

The Downside of Work-Life Balance
By James Clear
One way to think about work-life balance is with a concept known as The Four
Burners Theory. Here's how it was first explained to me:
Imagine that your life is represented by a stove with four burners on it. Each
bumer symbolizes one major quadrant of your life
1. The first burner represents your family
2. The second burner is your friends
3. The third burner is your health
4. The fourth bumer is your work.
The Four Burners Theory says that in order to be successful you have to cut off one
of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two."
Three Views of the Four Burners
My initial reaction to The Four Burners Theory was to search for a way to
bypass it. "Can I succeed and keep all four burners running? I wondered
Perhaps I could combine two burners. What if I lumped family and friends into
one category
Maybe I could combine health and work. "1 hear sitting all day is unhealthy
What if I got a standing desk? Now, I know what you are thinking. Believing that you
will be healthy because you bought a standing desk is like believing you are a rebel
because you ignored the fasten seatbelt sign on an airplane, but whatever
Soon I realized I was inventing these workarounds because I didn't want to face
the real issue: life is filed with tradeoffs. If you want to excel in your work and in your
marriage, then your friends and your health may have to suffer. If you want to be
healthy and succeed as a parent, then you might be forced to dial back your career
ambitions. Of course, you are free to divide your time equally among all four burners,
but you have to accept that you will never reach your full potential in any given area.
Essentially, we are forced to choose. Would you rather live a life that is
unbalanced, but high-performing in a certain area? Or would you rather live a life that
is balanced, but never maximizes your potential in a given quadrant?

The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</h2><br />

This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government. Among these, (9) contributes the most impact on one’s personal development because the crucial and intense socialization happens with it. Becoming part of a particular (10) is a product of socialization. And so, don’t forget to bear in mind that we need to choose the kind of activities we involve ourselves into.

It is the act of submitting oneself to the norms and conventions of society. Herbert Kelman identifies three types of conformity: compliance, identification and internalization. (14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior.

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />
