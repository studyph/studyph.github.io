                            9. Mr. S is the MIS Director of the Social Security System (SSS). Mr. S’s mother is working in a private firm and had incurred SSS loan equivalent for a five (5) month salary. Her mother wanted to apply for another loan but was disapproved for a reason that she has a pending SSS loan. To help his mother, Mr. S altered the actual data from the SSS Information System to make it appear that her mother had no more pending loan from the SSS. Ms. SS, the approving officer of the loan, in relying on the computer – generated output of the SSS Information System approved the loan of Mr. S’s mother.1. Do you think that Mr. S is guilty of Computer Related Forgery? Why or Why Not?2. Is Mr. S is guilty of Computer – Related Fraud? Why or Why Not?3. If Ms. SS, the approving authority is aware of the scheme made by Mr. S, then is Ms. SS also guilty of computer related forgery. Why or Why Not?4. If Ms. SS, the approving authority did not approve of the loan application of Mr. S’s mother, then is Mr. S will not anymore guilty of computer related forgery? Why or Why Not?</h2><br />
                        Social Security System Loan Approval (COMPUTER FORGER AND FRAUD)<p></p>1. Yes, Mr. S is guilty of Computer Related Forgery. <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Computer Related Forgery is altering information for means of impersonating of stealing an identity. </p><p>Mr. S changed data and information to help his mother have a loan approved. </p><p></p>2. Yes. Computer fraud is defined as an offense that consists of using or falsifying data stored, being processed or in transit, in order to derive personal benefits or financial gain.Since Mr. S's purpose is to take out some loan and so this is considered as fraud. He is defrauding the Social Security System.<p></p>3. No.  If the approving officer is aware of the scheme she would not be guilty of it but she will be considered as an accomplice. Or she will be charged for Negligence.<p></p>4. No, she will not. Since the loan did not go through, the fraud also would have been null and void. And so, if for example, authorities discovered that Mr. S. attempted to defraud the SSS, then he will still be charged of the same crime. To which it would not find Ms. SS to be at fault, whether she detected the con or not, because she did not approve of it. <p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1452888 (SSS)</p><p></p><p></p><br />

How is this article related with the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression of the 1930's in America?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black "anger", white "resentment", and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's controversial comments.</p><p></p><p>2.) As the former president Barack Obama said, "Let's be clear, There are no winners here" as he signed the stop-gap bill. He explained fully the enumerated implementations and its advantages and future benefits. ... But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words.</p><p></p><p>3.) A thesis statement clearly identifies the topic being discussed, includes the points discussed in the paper, and is written for a specific ...Always stated in your introduction.</p><p></p><p>4.)He said that the fact is, democracy has never been easy and our Founding Fathers argued about everything. We waged a Civil War. We overcame depression. We’ve lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.</p><p></p><p>5.) The statement of obama is sound and logical.</p><p></p><p>6.) the readers' emotions; name calling is an invalid argument that deviates from a certain topic and attacks the person; and, appeal to authority uses authoritative support to win an argument.</p><p></p><p>7.) For me yup. because I understand Obama’s speech he wants all people to be equal for everyone no matter what kind of color everyone has. And regardless of the status of different people, for Obama everyone has equal rights</p><p></p><p>8.) Yes, there is an issue similar in the Philippines the issue is that,The Poverty and Inequality in the Philippines remains a challenge until now.The discrimination is always have even in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>9.)  Wall Street Crash and Great Depression of the 1930's in America.This situation is still facing until current administration. President Obama’s Wall Street reform law created an independent agency to set and enforce clear, consistent rules for the financial marketplace. </p><br />
