                                            Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10. As one of the frontliners during this pandemic, doctors and nurses risk themselves just to provide healthcare services.​</a>

People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2.

Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, observation proved that eating a candy bar made a sick stomach feel better. B. In the example, there could be several reasons your sick stomach felt better after you ate a candy. C. In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by not eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. B.

                            23. Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10.

READING COMPREHENSION TEST (10 items) GRADE 9 - ENGLISH Direction: Read each selection carefully then road and answer tho questions that follow Writo the latter of your answer in your answer shoot DO NOT write anything on the questionnaire The Scientific Method ancient times saw that the sun came up from one side of the earth, moved across the sky, and went down on In ancient times people tried to explain the world around them based on what they saw. People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. People in ancient times believed that the sun travels around the earth. B. People in ancient times knew that the earth was round. C. People in ancient times didn't try to explain the world around them. 3. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, observation proved that eating a candy bar made a sick stomach feel better. B. In the example, there could be several reasons your sick stomach felt better after you ate a candy. C. In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by not eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. B. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a different kind of candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. C. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach 5. What does non-scientific thinking means? A.
