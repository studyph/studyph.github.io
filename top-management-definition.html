Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

How they make pancakes in Osaka by Elfren S. Cruz (August 4, 2016)  A marriage of a pancake and an omelet is a beautiful thing — two breakfast favorites grilled to juiciness and served piping hot.  In Japan, they call this delicious hybrid okonomiyaki, the “scrambled” version of which originated from Osaka. It is prepared like a pancake and served with okonomiyaki sauce, seaweed flakes, bonito flakes, Japanese mayo, and pickled ginger.  One of the original okonomiyaki restaurants in Osaka, Chibo Okonomiyaki, is now in Manila at S Maison in the newly opened Conrad Hotel. Okonomiyaki shops abound in Osaka, but Chibo is one of the oldest, dating back to 1973. They pride themselves on delivering the same original okonomiyaki taste consistently across all its branches around the world. Even visitors from Japan looking for something to eat that reminds them of home say that Chibo Okonomiyaki in Manila is up to their standards.  Imagine this: you are in a room (they call it the Presidential Room), engulfed in smoke while you watch the Chibo chef chop, toss, whisk, and press an okonomiyaki into shape, carefully creating a nice, thin crust. It resists your bite but the center — composed of anything you like, anything at all, because Chibo Okonomiyaki has a variant for all tastes — melts in your mouth.  Chef Akihiro, who is from Osaka and therefore versed in the art of creating these savory pancakes, creates several different dishes for us, while Kenji Komuro and David Guevarra, operations manager, share the dish’s origins and how they create the same okonomiyaki flavor in Manila. They bring most ingredients from Japan, while some they create. The batter and the sauce are key and must be consistent. As for what’s inside the pancake, their menu has more choices than you can handle.  Chef served us a really complex-looking one, topped with unsweetened meringue and a flattened crab crown — the Shirayukihime or “Snow White Princess,” an extra-soft okonomiyaki with prawn, bacon, pork, tomato, avocado and cheese. Kenji says it’s so pretty some guests like to order it during birthdays, in lieu of cake. Well, happy birthday to me. It’s delicious.</a>

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

How they make pancakes in Osaka by Elfren S. Cruz (August 4, 2016)  A marriage of a pancake and an omelet is a beautiful thing — two breakfast favorites grilled to juiciness and served piping hot.  In Japan, they call this delicious hybrid okonomiyaki, the “scrambled” version of which originated from Osaka. It is prepared like a pancake and served with okonomiyaki sauce, seaweed flakes, bonito flakes, Japanese mayo, and pickled ginger.  One of the original okonomiyaki restaurants in Osaka, Chibo Okonomiyaki, is now in Manila at S Maison in the newly opened Conrad Hotel. Okonomiyaki shops abound in Osaka, but Chibo is one of the oldest, dating back to 1973. They pride themselves on delivering the same original okonomiyaki taste consistently across all its branches around the world. Even visitors from Japan looking for something to eat that reminds them of home say that Chibo Okonomiyaki in Manila is up to their standards.  Imagine this: you are in a room (they call it the Presidential Room), engulfed in smoke while you watch the Chibo chef chop, toss, whisk, and press an okonomiyaki into shape, carefully creating a nice, thin crust. It resists your bite but the center — composed of anything you like, anything at all, because Chibo Okonomiyaki has a variant for all tastes — melts in your mouth.  Chef Akihiro, who is from Osaka and therefore versed in the art of creating these savory pancakes, creates several different dishes for us, while Kenji Komuro and David Guevarra, operations manager, share the dish’s origins and how they create the same okonomiyaki flavor in Manila. They bring most ingredients from Japan, while some they create. The batter and the sauce are key and must be consistent. As for what’s inside the pancake, their menu has more choices than you can handle.  Chef served us a really complex-looking one, topped with unsweetened meringue and a flattened crab crown — the Shirayukihime or “Snow White Princess,” an extra-soft okonomiyaki with prawn, bacon, pork, tomato, avocado and cheese. Kenji says it’s so pretty some guests like to order it during birthdays, in lieu of cake. Well, happy birthday to me. It’s delicious.</h2><br />
                        The whole passage basically is a <strong>process description </strong>of the experience in the new Okonomiyaki restaurant at some hotel in Manila that's very close to the original ones that can be found in Chiba, Osaka. The author relays what he knows about making the Okonomiyaki, it's relation to the innate culture of Chiba, and the specifics of what they have to offer here.<br /><br />
