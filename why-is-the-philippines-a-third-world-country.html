These maids are commonly called as "comfort women."	 10 The combined Filipino-American forces who were defeated by the Japanese totally surrendered and stopped fighting.	 11 General Douglas MacArthur stayed in Luzon to organize the liberation of the Philippines.	 12 Garcia administration promoted the “Filipino First” policy which aimed to boost the sales of local goods and services.	  13 In order to invade the Philippines, Japan had first to dismantle China's military power.	  ​</a>

                            18. The Third Republic of the Philippines was inaugurated on July 4, 1946, after World War 2 ended. What are the Characteristics of an Independent Country?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>What </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>akes </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>n </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>ndependent </strong><strong>Country</strong></p><p>• Has internationally recognized land and borders even if border disputes exist</p><p>• Has permanent residents</p><p>• Has sovereignty so that no other country has power over its territory</p><p>• Has organized economic activity that regulates foreign and domestic trade and issues money</p><p>• Has a transportation network for moving goods and people</p><p>• Has an education system</p><p>• Has recognition from other independent states</p><p>Twenty years after the 1872 revolt, <strong>Filipino</strong> <strong>nationalists</strong> began to organize secretly. While the <strong>Filipinos</strong> believed that a <strong>U.S</strong> defeat of <strong>Spain</strong> would lead to the free Philippines, the U.S refused to recognize the new government. Outraged by the betrayal, the Philippine republic declared war on the United States.</p><p>After its defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, Spain ceded its longstanding colony of the Philippines to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. The decision by U.S policymakers to annex the Philippines was not without domestic controversy.</p><p>Indeed, I agree that the <strong>Third Republic of the</strong> <strong>Philippines symbolizes freed</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>m from foreign</strong> <strong>oppressors</strong> because I know that now, we are free from the dangers and horrors brought by the Spanish Guardia Civil or an American Soldier holding a loaded rifle. But we have succumbed to the subtle encroachment of neo-colonialism.  As defined by Merriam Webster, neo-colonialism is the economic and political policies by which a great power indirectly maintains or extends its influence over other areas or peoples. This influence is not merely economic or political, but also cultural. Such a system allows the supplanting of a people’s unique indigenous culture by that another.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to Investopedia, a Third World country is an outdated and offensive term for a developing nation characterized by a population with low and middle incomes, and other socioeconomic indicators.</p><p>The Philippines is considered as one of the world's megadiverse countries with almost 75%  of the world's biodiversity found in the country. However, in recent years, the country has faced great challenges in protecting, conserving, and developing its biodiversity. In fact. there has been continued destruction of the country's resources and an increase in the number of endangered plant and animal species, reaching a total of more than 700 threatened species. These include the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), Philippine freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis), tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), yakal (Shorea astylosa) and waling waling (Vanda sanderiana), among others.</p><p></p><br />

                        INDUSTRIAL VS. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR<p>For a really long time, farming has been related with the creation of fundamental food crops. As of now,<strong> agriculture </strong>business or agribusiness far in excess of cultivating incorporates ranger service, dairy, natural product development, poultry, beekeeping, mushroom, discretionary, and so forth. For me, the government should prioritized the agricultural sector because Philippine is an agriculture country  and the agriculture is a source of livelihood in the country. By far most's rule wellspring of work is developing. Around 70% of people rely clearly upon <strong>agriculture</strong>  as a job. The outcome of the non-improvement of non-<strong>agricultural</strong> activities to hold the rapidly creating people is this high rate in cultivating. Agriculture also contributes to national revenue because it is the main source of national income for most developing countries.<strong> Agriculture  </strong>supply of food as well as fodder.</p><p></p><p>what is agriculture: brainly.ph/question/1375506</p><p></p><p>#LETSTUDY</p><br />
