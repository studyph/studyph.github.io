                                            Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</a>

                            5. Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</h2><br />
