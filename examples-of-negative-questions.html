                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. What are bivariate data? Give an example.</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>Bivariate data could also be two sets of items that are dependent on each other. </strong></p><p><strong>For example: Ice cream sales compared to the temperature that day. Traffic accidents along with the weather on a particular day.</strong></p><p><strong>2. What is a scatterplot? What is the importance of scatterplot? </strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. Scatter plots are important in statistics because they can show the extent of correlation, if any, between the values of observed quantities or phenomena (called variables).</strong></p><p><strong>3. Describe a positive correlation?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>A negative correlation? Positive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in tandem—that is, in the same direction</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Negative or inverse correlation describes when two variables tend to move in opposite size and direction from one another, such that when one increases the other variable decreases, and vice-versa.</strong></p><p><strong>4. In the analysis of a scatterplot, what two elements should be  considered? </strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>A scatterplot is a useful summary of a set of bivariate data (two variables), and another may be considered a response variable (such as annual income).</strong></p><p><strong>5.  How is the strength of correlation determined?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> The relationship between two variables is generally considered </strong><strong>strong </strong><strong>when their r value is larger than 0.7. The correlation r measures the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I HOPE IT HELPS:)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline.</p><p>2.When stress becomes overwhelming and prolonged, the risks for mental health problems and medical problems increase. Long-term stress increases the risk of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, substance use problems, sleep problems, pain and bodily complaints such as muscle tension.</p><p>3.Stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. Positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. On the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response.</p><p>4.Some examples of external stressors include: Major life changes. These changes can be positive, such as a new marriage, a planned pregnancy, a promotion or a new house. Or they can be negative, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#HopeItHelp </p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
