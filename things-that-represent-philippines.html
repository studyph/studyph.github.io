                                            ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</a>

                            6. ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</h2><br />

                        ✏️ANSWER:✏️<p>1.<strong>When conducting research for your homework or project work, you’ll often come across sources of information that p</strong><strong> no</strong><strong>resent facts or opinions. I’ll be helping you to find out more about what they are and how to differentiate between them!</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>There are several different wa</strong><strong> up</strong><strong>ys that we know what we know, including informal observation, selective observation, overgeneralization, authority, and research methods. Research methods are a much more reliable source of knowledge than most of our other ways of knowing.</strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>A lot of people live their lives having no clue what they want. They usually follow the American Dream without a second thought, just because that’s what’s expected of them.</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>According to Locke, knowledge of the external world is knowledge of 'real existence. ' Knowledge of real existence is knowledge that something really exists and is not a mere figment of your imagination. Locke argues that we can know three different kinds of things really exist.</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>"</strong><strong>Beauty is skin-deep” the saying goes, and it seems most of you agree when you describe what you consider most beautiful in a person. Confidence, kindness, happiness, dignity and intelligence all ranked in the top five out of 19 attributes that people said make the opposite and same sex beautiful.</strong></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The experience of aesthetic emotions can happen when a person perceives and evaluates a stimulus for its beautiful appeal or virtues. Aesthetic emotions are experienced through vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell and cognitive processing in response to respected stimuli</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>One view of emotional expression in art is that it is preceded by a perturbation or excitement from a vague cause about which the artist is uncertain and therefore anxious. The artist then proceeds to express feelings and ideas in words or paint or stone or the like, clarifying them and achieving a release of tension.</strong></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>As visible religion, art communicates religious beliefs, customs, and values through iconography and depictions of the human body. The foundational principle for the interconnections between art and religion is the reciprocity between image making and meaning making as creative correspondence of humanity with divinity.</strong></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Among superstitions, one of the oldest and most enduring is that crossing paths with a black cat will bring on bad luck. The dark-colored felines have also been folded into modern Halloween symbols, giving them the (unearned) reputation of being spooky.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>If you can satisfy yourself that the premises are true, perhaps because they are backed up by good sub-arguments, then you know that you have a good argument. If a premise is false or if it's not backed up by a good sub-argument, then the argument is </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>traditional branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it, although the term is not easily defined. Traditionally, metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Believing that you control your own destiny means you have recognized your internal locus of control. It means you take responsibility for your thoughts and actions and their outcomes. By thinking this way, you can become unstoppable. You can learn how to control your destiny.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Thomas Aquinas took this view into Christianity. In Judaism and in some Christian denominations, (except for angels) only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and the concept of immortality may have been influenced by Plato).</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent within a system, as opposed to that which is only imaginary. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown.</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>After Marcos was deposed in 1986, the newly drafted 1987 Constitution prohibited the death penalty but allowed the Congress to reinstate it "hereafter" for "heinous crimes"; making the Philippines the first Asian country to abolish capital punishment.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
