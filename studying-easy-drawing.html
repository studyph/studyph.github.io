A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 2. As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992). These interactive practices appear to draw upon and enhance interactional and writing skills. A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 3. The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

                                            II. Concept Development 
Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                                            Activity: Yes or No StatementCarefully analyse each developmental concept on enhancing the brainfunctions. Write Yes if you agree with the concept conveyed, and writeNo if you disagree with it.1. Mind power is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess.2. Your mind mapping ability may not enhance your brain functions.3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body andthe right brain controls the left side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.4. Everybody is not expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is no need to enhance brain functions.5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape your schedule and coursework, to suit your own personality type.6. Remember that mind mapping is a highly effective way of losing information in and out of your brain. Mind mapping is not in any way acreative and logical means of note taking and note-making that literally "maps out" your ideas.7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony Buzan.8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will guide your mind map connected to each other.9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mindmap easy. They are the use of colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size.10.

                                            168 Chapter 2 Solving Equations and Inequalities Example 3 Finding the Dimensions of Room A rectangular family room is twice as long as it is wide, and its perimeter is 84 feet. Find the dimensions of the family room. Solution For this problem, it helps to draw a diagram, as shown in Figure 2.2. 2. Length + 2 Width Perimeter Verbal Model: Labels: Perimeter = 84 Width = w Length = / = 2w Equation: 2(2w) + 2w = 84 6w = 84 w = 14 Original equation Combine like terms. Divide each side by 6. Because the length is twice the width, you have 1 = 2w = 2(14) = 28. Length is twice width. Substitute 14 for w. Simplify. So, the dimensions of the room are 14 feet by 28 feet. ✔CHECKPOINT Now try Exercise 59. (feet) (feet) (feet) Figure 2.2 The figure provided with Example 3 is not really essential to the solution. Nevertheless, strongly encourage your students to develop the habit of including sketches with their solutions even if they are not required.

As a learner-centred process approach to second language (L2) writing, peer response has been widely adopted and studied since the 1990s (Hyland &amp; Hyland, 2006). The dialogic nature of peer response seems to foster multiple support systems (Hyland, 2000) and communicative behaviours (Villamil &amp; de Guerrero, 1996). L2 research has shown that peer response can increase chances for meaning negotiation and language practice (Lockhart &amp; Ng, 1995; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994), encourage collaborative reading and writing (Tsui &amp; Ng, 2000), and promote writing revisions (Berg, 1999; Mendonca &amp; Johnson, 1994; Min, 2006, 2008; Stanley, 1992). These interactive practices appear to draw upon and enhance interactional and writing skills. A Academic Text C. All answers are Correct B. Not Academic Text D. None of the above 3. The story of the Bible in translation is, like the text itself, far from straightforward. Private spiritual reading may well have lain at the heart of Protestant piety but, as Lori Anne Ferrell has pointed out, the Bible was desperately difficult to understand and Protestant writers of biblical text-books knew this only too well. Their approach was to warn readers of the 'knotty Passages' and 'things hard to be understood' whilst, at the same time, steering them to the 'Shallows where the Lambs may wade' with the assurance (and encouragement) that the Truths necessary to Salvation are plain, and of easy access to the weakest understanding.

                            7. II. Concept Development 
Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                            14. 168 Chapter 2 Solving Equations and Inequalities Example 3 Finding the Dimensions of Room A rectangular family room is twice as long as it is wide, and its perimeter is 84 feet. Find the dimensions of the family room. Solution For this problem, it helps to draw a diagram, as shown in Figure 2.2. 2. Length + 2 Width Perimeter Verbal Model: Labels: Perimeter = 84 Width = w Length = / = 2w Equation: 2(2w) + 2w = 84 6w = 84 w = 14 Original equation Combine like terms. Divide each side by 6. Because the length is twice the width, you have 1 = 2w = 2(14) = 28. Length is twice width. Substitute 14 for w. Simplify. So, the dimensions of the room are 14 feet by 28 feet. ✔CHECKPOINT Now try Exercise 59. (feet) (feet) (feet) Figure 2.2 The figure provided with Example 3 is not really essential to the solution. Nevertheless, strongly encourage your students to develop the habit of including sketches with their solutions even if they are not required.
