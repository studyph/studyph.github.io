Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

                                            A new movement swept through Europe during the 18th century and created a progressive shift in culture, technology and art. As the world experienced the importance of scientific innovation for human development, the Age of Enlightenment was largely a response to the industrial Revolution. Europe dominated this period, inevitably birthing two major periods of philosophy and visual art. Side by side, Neoclassicism and Romanticism competed, in a reason to express passion and desire for classics. The key difference between neoclassicism and romanticism is that objectivity, rationality and intellect are the focal points of neoclassicism while human imagination, nature, and emotions or feelings are stressed by romanticism.​</a>

Theater arts is one of the ancient traditions of the people in Asia particularly in Japan and China. This theater art form was transmitted from generation to generation. 2. The puppets are made of buffalo hide and intricately designed, down to the most minute detail of costume and color, to help the audience distinguish between the different characters.3. The dhalang tells the stories of kings, princesses, ogres, and knights, using deft hand movement and narration. While traditional performances used cotton sheets and oil lamps to create the play of light, electric bulbs or other sources of light are used today.4. Most of the Asiantraditions employ either dance or dance-like, stylized movements, while movements are frequently interwoven with text.5. The term kabuki originally suggested the unorthodox and shocking character of this art form. In modern Japanese, the word is written with three characters: ka, signifying “song”; bu, “dance”; and ki, “skill.”6. The characters in the Kabuki may be loyal or treacherous, beautiful or ugly, good or bad.7. As one of the classic art forms of imperial China, Kabuki Opera is a staple of cultural tradition in the modern era8. Asian theater typically combines storytelling, dance, music, and mime and incorporates masks, makeup, scenery, costumes, props, and scripts.9. Wayang Kulit was declared a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2003.10. The images of Peking opera are always vividly manifested in bright costumes that show the styles of ancient China.​</a>

                                            In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

Write the signal words in the box below and tell whether it shows emphasis, addition, comparison, contrast, illustration, consequence, or cause-and-effect. The number in parentheses below tells you how many signal words are found in the selection. Along with food production, human beings found time to develop the arts and sciences. Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>How are transition signals used?
</p><p>
</p><p>•     Transition signals are usually placed at the start of sentences; however, they may also appear in the middle or end of sentences.
</p><p>
</p><p>•     A transition signal, or the clause introduced by a transition signal, is usually separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.
</p><p>
</p><p>•     You DO NOT need to use transition signals in every sentence in a paragraph; however, good use of transition words will help to make the relationship between the ideas in your writing clear and logical.
</p><p>
</p><p>Which transition signals can I use?
</p><p>
</p><p>Before choosing a particular transition signal to use, be sure you understand its meaning and usage completely and be sure that it's the right match for the logic in your paper. Transition signals all have different meanings, nuances, and connotations.

These are three-dimensional shapes expressing length, width, and depth. Balls, cylinders, boxes, and pyramids are forms. 6. It is the area between and around objects. It can also refer to the feeling of depth. Real space is three-dimensional; in visual art, when we create the feeling or illusion of depth, we call it space. 7. It is the feeling of unity created when all parts (sizes, amounts, or number) relate well with each other. When drawing the human figure, proportion can refer to the size of the head compared to the rest of the body 8. It is created when one or more elements of design are used repeatedly to create a feeling of organized movement. Rhythm creates a mood like music or dancing. To keep rhythm exciting and active, variety is essential. 9. It is the use of several elements of design to hold the viewer's attention and to guide the viewer's eye through and around the work of art. 10. It is the feeling of harmony between all parts of the work of art, which creates a sense C completeness11. It is the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space.

                            11. A new movement swept through Europe during the 18th century and created a progressive shift in culture, technology and art. As the world experienced the importance of scientific innovation for human development, the Age of Enlightenment was largely a response to the industrial Revolution.

The dhalang tells the stories of kings, princesses, ogres, and knights, using deft hand movement and narration. While traditional performances used cotton sheets and oil lamps to create the play of light, electric bulbs or other sources of light are used today.4. Most of the Asiantraditions employ either dance or dance-like, stylized movements, while movements are frequently interwoven with text.5. The term kabuki originally suggested the unorthodox and shocking character of this art form. In modern Japanese, the word is written with three characters: ka, signifying “song”; bu, “dance”; and ki, “skill.”6. The characters in the Kabuki may be loyal or treacherous, beautiful or ugly, good or bad.7.

                            16. In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

Some hunter-gatherers, as was already pointed out, must have had considerable leisure without making any notable movement toward civilization. A difference between the hunter-gatherers and farmers that is important to note is that the former are usually nomadic; while, the latter are sedentary. But even those pre-agricuítural people who had fairly stationary living sites did not develop in civilized ways comparable to the farmers. Agriculture probably required a far greater discipline than did any form of food collecting. Seeds had to be planted at certain seasons, some protection had to be given to the growing plants and animals, harvests had to be reaped, stored, and divided. Thus, we might argue that it was neither leisure time nor a sedentary existence that produced great changes in human culture. The cause was rather the more rigorous demands associated with an agricultural way of life. Humanity was changing plants and animals to suit its needs, and living in close relation with plants and animals was changing humans' way of life.

                            23. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on.
