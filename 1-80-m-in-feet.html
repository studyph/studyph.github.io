1. In physics, the centripetal force acting on an object that is moving along a circular path can be computed using the following formula: \large F=\frac{mv^2}{r}. Where f is centripetal force (in N), m is the mass of the object (in kg), v is the tangential velocity of the object (in m/s), and r is the radius of its circular path (in m). What is the centripetal force if the velocity of the objects is 10 m/s, its circular path has a radius of \large \sqrt{15} and its mass is \large \sqrt{80} kg?
2. The distance, d, in miles that a person can see to the horizon can be modelled by the formula \large d=\sqrt{\frac{3h}{2}} where h is the person’s height above sea level in feet. To the nearest tenth of a mile, how far to the horizon can a person see if they are 50 feet above sea level? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a mile.</a>
