Shoot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof glass
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium

                                            I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

You shoot me down, but I won't fall

You shoot me down, but I won't fall

I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

I got my driver's license last weekJust like we always talked about'Cause you were so excited for meTo finally drive up to your houseBut today I drove through the suburbsCrying 'cause you weren't aroundAnd you're probably with that blonde girlWho always made me doubtShe's so much older than meShe's everything I'm insecure aboutYeah, today I drove through the suburbs'Cause how could I ever love someone else?And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no oneAnd I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm goneGuess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your streetAnd all my friends are tiredOf hearing how much I miss you, butI kinda feel sorry for them'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeahToday I drove through the suburbsAnd pictured I was driving home to youAnd I know we weren't perfectBut I've never felt this way for no one, ohAnd I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm goneI guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your streetTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my lifeTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my lifeIf I'm a pagan of the good timesMy lover's the sunlightTo keep the Goddess on my sideShe demands a sacrificeDrain the whole seaGet something shinySomething meaty for the main courseThat's a fine looking high horseWhat you got in the stable?We've a lot of starving faithfulThat looks tastyThat looks plentyThis is hungry workTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knifeOffer me my deathless deathGood God, let me give you my lifeTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knifeOffer me my deathless deathGood God, let me give you my lifeNo masters or kings when the ritual beginsThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sinIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly sceneOnly then I am humanOnly then I am cleanOh, oh, Amen, Amen, AmenTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my lifeTake me to churchI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your liesI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knifeOffer me that deathless deathGood God, let me give you my life.Question:1.What song is this?_______________________.​</h2><br />

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.
