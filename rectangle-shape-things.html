And here are two word problems where the knowledge on the properties of parallelograms (rectangle, rhombus, square) could be applied.  1. The perimeter of a standard basketball court is 288 ft. Find the dimensions of the basketball court if its length is 44 feet longer than its width.2. A baseball diamond is shaped like a square. Each side is 90 feet long. How far is the second base from home plate?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A rectangle is a 2D shape in geometry, having 4 sides and 4 corners. Its two sides meet at right angles. Thus, a rectangle has 4 angles, each measuring 90 ̊. The opposite sides of a rectangle have the same lengths and are parallel.  Two sides are said to be parallel, when the distance between them remains the same at all points.</p><br />

                            14. A parallelogram is a special type of quadrilateral. It is a four-sided polygon with two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel. The word "quadrilateral" is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning side. This means, quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. We can see the shapes of quadrilaterals in various things around us, like in buildings, books, signs, jewelries, computers, patterns on fabric and furniture designs. Indeed, their presence are infinite in real life. Anything with four sides either concave or convex, regular or irregular in shape, is a quadrilateral. In naming a quadrilateral, we use the symbol A quadrilateral can be named by listing its vertices starting with any example, kites and trapezoids are vertex and writing or reading the other vertices in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. There are many kinds of quadrilaterals. Some quadrilaterals are parallelograms, some are not, For quadrilaterals. but they are not parallelograms. Rectangles, squares, and rhombuses are parallelograms. reflection ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Yes, that's correct. A parallelogram is a special type of quadrilateral with parallel opposite sides, while rectangles, squares, and rhombuses are specific types of parallelograms with certain properties such as equal side lengths or angles. In geometry, the study of quadrilaterals is important for understanding the properties and relationships between shapes and for solving problems in areas such as construction, engineering, and physics.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>here reflection:</strong></p><p></p><p>This passage provides a definition and explanation of a parallelogram and a quadrilateral.

It is a four-sided polygon with two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel. The word "quadrilateral" is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning side. This means, quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. We can see the shapes of quadrilaterals in various things around us, like in buildings, books, signs, jewelries, computers, patterns on fabric and furniture designs. Indeed, their presence are infinite in real life. Anything with four sides either concave or convex, regular or irregular in shape, is a quadrilateral. In naming a quadrilateral, we use the symbol A quadrilateral can be named by listing its vertices starting with any example, kites and trapezoids are vertex and writing or reading the other vertices in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction. There are many kinds of quadrilaterals. Some quadrilaterals are parallelograms, some are not, For quadrilaterals. but they are not parallelograms. Rectangles, squares, and rhombuses are parallelograms. reflection ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>of a parallelogram is its mirror image. In addition, a parallelogram has equal adjacent sides and equal opposite angles. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, meaning they divide each other into equal halves. Parallelograms have several important properties that make them useful in various geometric applications, including construction, design, and engineering</strong></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>1.Identify the sides: In a parallelogram, two pairs of opposite sides are parallel. This means that if you draw a line connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides, they will be equal in length.<p></p>2.Identify the angles: The opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. This means that if you draw a line connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides and measure the angle formed by the line and one of the sides, it will be the same as the angle formed by the line and the opposite side.<p></p><p></p>3.Measure the diagonals: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, meaning they divide each other into equal halves. This can be confirmed by measuring the length of the diagonals and verifying that they are equal.<p></p>4.Determine the shape of the parallelogram: Depending on the specific properties of the parallelogram, it can be classified as a rectangle, square, or rhombus. To determine which shape the parallelogram is, check if it has equal sides and equal angles. If it does, it is a rhombus. If it has equal sides and right angles, it is a rectangle. If it has equal sides and equal angles and is also a rectangle, it is a square.<p></p>5.Apply properties: Once you have determined the properties of the parallelogram, you can use them to solve geometric problems, such as finding the area or perimeter, or to make mathematical deductions, such as proving theorems.<br />
