Modern Generafion Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom. He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc. Todays youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading is the opinion of majority of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol, smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is furning from bad to worse is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home, college, workplace or the church temple, mosque and gurudwara. The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent couse they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society. By this! mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands. 1.

3. Charter Schools Are About Making Choices
"Public charter schools belong to the public schooling system. It means that they follow the accepted teaching standards. These institution must demonstrate the effectiveness of their established methods.
4. At par with the world 
before K to 12 became a law in 2013, Philippines was one of the last three countries in the world that still implement a ten-year basic education program. With this, students finish high school at an average age of 16. This age is not yet employable. Aside from that, students didn't have mastered or specialized  skill that was useful for job-seeking.

Modern Generafion Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom. He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc. Todays youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading is the opinion of majority of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol, smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is furning from bad to worse is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home, college, workplace or the church temple, mosque and gurudwara. The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent couse they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society. By this! mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands. 1.

The period of one o'clock to eight o'clock is a good couple of hours of lost profits Coupled with the Sin Tax, it could also mean a loss of revenue for the national government should such a law be implemented in more cities.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A bar, also known as a saloon, a tavern or tippling house, or sometimes as a pub or club, is a retail business establishment that serves alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other beverages such as mineral water and soft drinks. Bars often also sell snack foods, such as crisps or peanuts, for consumption on their premises. Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a restaurant menu. The term "bar" refers to the countertop where drinks are prepared and served, and by extension to the overall premises.</p><p></p><p>The term derives from the metal or wooden bar (barrier) that is often located along the length of the "bar".[1] Over many years, heights of bars were lowered, and high stools added, and the brass bar remains today.</p><p></p><p>Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Bars that offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as "music bars", "live venues", or "nightclubs". Types of bars range from inexpensive dive bars[2] to elegant places of entertainment, often accompanying restaurants for dining.</p><p></p><p>Many bars operate a discount period, designated a "happy hour" or discount of the day to encourage off-peak-time patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a cover charge or a minimum drink-purchase requirement during their peak hours. Bars may have bouncers to ensure that patrons are of legal age, to eject drunk or belligerent patrons, and to collect cover charges. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a live band, vocalist, comedian, or disc jockey playing recorded music.</p><p></p><p>Patrons may sit or stand at the counter and be served by a bartender. Depending on the size of a bar and its approach, alcohol may be served at the bar by bartenders, at tables by servers, or by a combination of the two. The "back bar" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind the counter. In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>plsss brainliest me ty</p><br />

"Public charter schools belong to the public schooling system. It means that they follow the accepted teaching standards. These institution must demonstrate the effectiveness of their established methods.
4. At par with the world 
before K to 12 became a law in 2013, Philippines was one of the last three countries in the world that still implement a ten-year basic education program. With this, students finish high school at an average age of 16. This age is not yet employable. Aside from that, students didn't have mastered or specialized  skill that was useful for job-seeking.

II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance

momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.
