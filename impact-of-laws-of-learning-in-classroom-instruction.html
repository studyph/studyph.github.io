                            7. How do the school campus and the classroom in particular impact the learning of the students going to school? What are your conclusion?</h2><br />
                        <p>Children, even adults, learn through their senses. Different stimuli from the environment affect the way they perceive. This started at home when babies see and learn colors; touch and differentiate hot from cold temperature; taste and eat sweet or sour food; hear and react to soft and loud music; and smell a perfume and stinky trash. All of these are teaching them which is good and bad, better and worse. Thus, when they go to school, whatever they perceived as best through their senses will be used. If <strong>the school campus and classroom</strong> smells stinky or noisy, children may not be interested to learn. This is because the environment has a great <strong>impact to the learning of the students going to school</strong>. Thus, it needs to be conducive. It has to be appealing to the eyes; has to have a comfortable [just right] temperature; has to offer good choices of food [in the canteen]; has to have trees and plants for clean, good-smelling air; and has to create good quality of rooms, not creating echoes of voices or hearing the other room’s noise. Hence, if these are not met properly, some students may not be able to focus or may not be interested to learn.  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Much has been said, resources spent and anguish risen over the development of
</p><p>on-line learning environments. Many researchers have delved into the
</p><p>pedagogies underpinning on-line courses. Other researchers have examined the
</p><p>academic results of students who have undertaken on-line courses compared to
</p><p>those who have taken the same course conducted in a more traditional approach.
</p><p>There seems to be little research into the social impact of on-line learning
</p><p>environments on those who participate in these courses. This paper examines
</p><p>the current literature on the social impact of this new learning environment and
</p><p>raises questions for further research. The author proposes that a study on not
</p><p>just the participants in on-line learning needs to be addressed, but the whole
</p><p>community - the participants and their families, the delivers, and the course
