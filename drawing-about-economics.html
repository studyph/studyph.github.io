                            1. If food production is not sufficiently profitable to make a living, what conclusions would you draw about an economy or economic system? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The economic analysis of the world food problem concerns the dynamics of production, income, growth, demand and trade. The 'law of diminishing returns' suggests that labour incomes fall as population density increases. ... If supply grows faster, food prices and farm incomes fall, driving resources out of agriculture.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Increases in production generally correspond with lower unemployment rates. Lower unemployment can result in higher wages as companies pay workers more to meet consumer demand. ... A decrease in production levels creates an opposite and negative effect on the economy.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>To increase economic growth</strong></p><p><strong>To increase economic growthLower interest rates – reduce the cost of borrowing and increase consumer spending and investment.</strong></p><p><strong>To increase economic growthLower interest rates – reduce the cost of borrowing and increase consumer spending and investment.Increased real wages – if nominal wages grow above inflation then consumers have more disposable to spend.</strong></p><p><strong>To increase economic growthLower interest rates – reduce the cost of borrowing and increase consumer spending and investment.Increased real wages – if nominal wages grow above inflation then consumers have more disposable to spend.Higher global growth – leading to increased export spending.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A possible symbol to represent poverty in the Philippines could be a <strong>broken chain</strong>. This symbol represents the idea that poverty is a chain that binds people and prevents them from reaching their full potential. The broken chain signifies the need to break free from poverty and the barriers that it creates.</p><p></p><p>The broken chain symbol also represents the idea that poverty is not an individual problem, but rather a systemic issue that requires collective action. It calls on society as a whole to work towards alleviating poverty and creating a more equitable and just society for all.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of issues in the socio-cultural, economic, and political aspects of society. Some of these issues include increased isolation and loneliness due to social distancing measures, economic downturns and job losses, and political disputes over the appropriate response to the crisis.</p><p></p><p>To understand and solve these problems, I think the best principle to use is institutionalism. This approach focuses on the role of institutions, such as governments, corporations, and schools, in shaping social and economic outcomes. By examining the policies and practices of these institutions, we can better understand the causes of the issues related to the pandemic and develop effective solutions. For example, we can look at how government policies and corporate practices have contributed to the spread of the virus and the economic impact of the crisis, and consider how these institutions can be reformed to better address these challenges.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on society, and the best way to understand and solve these problems is through the use of the institutionalism principle. By examining the role of institutions in shaping the course of the pandemic, we can develop effective solutions to address the socio-cultural, economic, and political issues that have arisen.</p><p></p><p>Interpret mo na lng ung picture from the answer that I give to you :)))</p><br />
