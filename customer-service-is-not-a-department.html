                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bert and John Jacobs have a personal and business philosophy much like Jake: simplicity, humor, and humility. However, both understand that even with this philosophy, they need to be good managers and they need good managers throughout the organization in order to stay successful.</p><p></p><p>Bert and John designed their first tee shirts In 1989 and sold them door-to-door In college dorms along the East Coast and In Boston where they’d set up shops using an old card table In locations on one-way streets so they could pick up and move quickly if they needed to.</p><p></p><p>They used this simple sales approach because, like many young entrepreneurs, they couldn’t afford required business licenses. Although they met a lot of wonderful people and heard a lot of good stories during these early years, sales weren’t that great.
