The main difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is the presence of DNA and organelles. 2. Eukaryotic cells contain the membrane-bound cellular body called organelles. 3. Cell walls are present in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. 4. Eukaryotes were the first form of life on Earth for millions of years until ali other organisms came into being through the process of evolution. 5. The word prokaryotic can be translated to mean 'before nucleus', which means prokaryotic cells do not have either a nucleus or organelles. 6. The organelle is a structure found in eukaryotic cells that contains the DNA. 7. The nucleus are cellular "factories that perform important tasks and functions. 8. Having various organelles make the eukaryotic cells more efficient at completing important cellular functions which allow them grow much larger. 9.

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

It narrates a realistic event. C. It presents an argument on career decision making. D. It raises a problem on how to advance one's profession. 3. What might be the next action the author has to make? A. Choosing a specialization in his vocation B. Having second thoughts if he will continue his degree C. Informing his family about his change of plans D. Seeking advice from his friends on what's best for him 4. What does the author want to impart to his readers? A. Grown-ups at some point in life must make a crucial decision. B. Passion can drive the person to work hard. C. Small sacrifices must be made along the way as one reaches his goals. D.

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

Hearing this news, David instructs the prophet Nathan to anoint David’s son, Solomon, as king. The people rally behind Solomon in a grand procession to the royal throne. Before dying, David charges Solomon to remain faithful to God and his laws. Solomon solidifies his claim to the throne by killing Joab, Adonijah, and the remaining dissenters from David’s reign. He also makes an alliance with Egypt by marrying the pharaoh’s daughter.Because Solomon carefully obeys God’s laws, God appears to him in a dream and offers to grant the new king one wish. Solomon asks for wisdom to govern with justice and to know the difference between right and wrong. God is so impressed with Solomon’s humble request that he promises Solomon the additional gifts of wealth and long life. As a result, Solomon lives in great opulence and his empire stretches from Egypt to the Euphrates River. He earns international fame for his wise sayings and scientific knowledge.Tracker dslogo Full text: DraculaWith his vast resources, Solomon builds an elaborate temple to God as well as a palace for himself in Jerusalem. Construction begins exactly four hundred and eighty years after Israel’s exodus from Egypt. Solomon conscripts thousands of laborers for the work and imports materials from neighboring countries. The Temple is lined with gold and features large, hand-sculpted angels and pillars. Solomon places the Ark of the Covenant inside, and all of Israel gathers for the dedication. After sacrificing herds of animals on the altar, Solomon prays for God’s blessing on the Temple. God appears to Solomon and promises to dwell in the Temple so long as Solomon and the Israelites are obedient to his laws. If they are not, God will remove his presence from the Temple, destroying both the temple and the nation.Solomon’s success continues until he marries many foreign women. They influence him to worship and erect altars to foreign deities. God is infuriated and tells Solomon that he will dismember the kingdom. God will tear away all of the tribes from Solomon’s kingdom except for one, Judah. God allows the tribe of Judah to remain since Solomon is David’s son. Following God’s declaration, a prophet meets one of Solomon’s officials, Jeroboam, with a cloak torn into twelve pieces, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The prophet hands Jeroboam ten of the twelve pieces and explains that God has chosen him to rule these selected tribes as Israel’s new king.Solomon dies, and his son Rehoboam assumes the throne. Led by Jeroboam, the people gather before the young king to request that Rehoboam treat them more kindly than Solomon did during his reign. Rehoboam is headstrong and refuses, threatening to punish and enslave the people. The Israelites unite in rebellion, cursing the tribe of Judah and eluding Rehoboam’s attempts to forcefully subdue them. They head north, where they crown Jeroboam king of Israel in the city of Shechem. Israel splits into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel in the north, and the kingdom of Judah in the south.To distinguish the new, separate kingdom of Israel from the old kingdom in Jerusalem, Jeroboam erects altars and shrines to golden calves throughout the northern land. The Israelites worship the idols, and the Levite priests, formerly devoted to God, serve them as well. One day, Jeroboam’s son is ill, and his wife approaches a prophet to seek guidance. The prophet warns that Jeroboam’s household will be destroyed and that Israel will eventually lose control of the promised land because of Jeroboam’s abhorrent practices. One generation later, Jeroboam’s entire family is slaughtered when another Israelite takes the throne by force.​</a>

Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                            10. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                            19. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />

Hearing this news, David instructs the prophet Nathan to anoint David’s son, Solomon, as king. The people rally behind Solomon in a grand procession to the royal throne. Before dying, David charges Solomon to remain faithful to God and his laws. Solomon solidifies his claim to the throne by killing Joab, Adonijah, and the remaining dissenters from David’s reign. He also makes an alliance with Egypt by marrying the pharaoh’s daughter.Because Solomon carefully obeys God’s laws, God appears to him in a dream and offers to grant the new king one wish. Solomon asks for wisdom to govern with justice and to know the difference between right and wrong. God is so impressed with Solomon’s humble request that he promises Solomon the additional gifts of wealth and long life. As a result, Solomon lives in great opulence and his empire stretches from Egypt to the Euphrates River. He earns international fame for his wise sayings and scientific knowledge.Tracker dslogo Full text: DraculaWith his vast resources, Solomon builds an elaborate temple to God as well as a palace for himself in Jerusalem. Construction begins exactly four hundred and eighty years after Israel’s exodus from Egypt. Solomon conscripts thousands of laborers for the work and imports materials from neighboring countries. The Temple is lined with gold and features large, hand-sculpted angels and pillars. Solomon places the Ark of the Covenant inside, and all of Israel gathers for the dedication. After sacrificing herds of animals on the altar, Solomon prays for God’s blessing on the Temple. God appears to Solomon and promises to dwell in the Temple so long as Solomon and the Israelites are obedient to his laws. If they are not, God will remove his presence from the Temple, destroying both the temple and the nation.Solomon’s success continues until he marries many foreign women. They influence him to worship and erect altars to foreign deities. God is infuriated and tells Solomon that he will dismember the kingdom. God will tear away all of the tribes from Solomon’s kingdom except for one, Judah. God allows the tribe of Judah to remain since Solomon is David’s son. Following God’s declaration, a prophet meets one of Solomon’s officials, Jeroboam, with a cloak torn into twelve pieces, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The prophet hands Jeroboam ten of the twelve pieces and explains that God has chosen him to rule these selected tribes as Israel’s new king.Solomon dies, and his son Rehoboam assumes the throne. Led by Jeroboam, the people gather before the young king to request that Rehoboam treat them more kindly than Solomon did during his reign. Rehoboam is headstrong and refuses, threatening to punish and enslave the people. The Israelites unite in rebellion, cursing the tribe of Judah and eluding Rehoboam’s attempts to forcefully subdue them. They head north, where they crown Jeroboam king of Israel in the city of Shechem. Israel splits into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel in the north, and the kingdom of Judah in the south.To distinguish the new, separate kingdom of Israel from the old kingdom in Jerusalem, Jeroboam erects altars and shrines to golden calves throughout the northern land. The Israelites worship the idols, and the Levite priests, formerly devoted to God, serve them as well. One day, Jeroboam’s son is ill, and his wife approaches a prophet to seek guidance. The prophet warns that Jeroboam’s household will be destroyed and that Israel will eventually lose control of the promised land because of Jeroboam’s abhorrent practices. One generation later, Jeroboam’s entire family is slaughtered when another Israelite takes the throne by force.​</h2><br />

                            27. Read the (EXPOSITORY TEXT) below and try to answer the question and pls try to answer that correctly.
Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
