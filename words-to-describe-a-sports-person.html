The first rule is to expect the best from the people youlead. A true leader needs to drop the role of "watchdog" and to display a positive attitude toward everyone who worksunder him or her. The second principle is to make a thorough study of the other person's needs. 2.( walk) amile in another person's shoes will allow a leader to truly understand someone he or she is working with. The third ruleis to establish high standards of excellence. Many people have never learned the pleasure of 3.(set) highstandards and 4.(live ) up to them. The fourth rule is to create an environment where failure is not fatal.People who expect to succeed all the time often cannot rise from a failure. An effective motivator needs to know how tohelp people deal with their failure.(Climb) on other people's bandwagons is the fifth principle that McGinnis suggests. A good leaderneeds to identify the beliefs and causes of the people that he/she works with. By 6.(use ) these good ideas,he/she can encourage them to pursue as many of these goals as possible. 7.(employ) models to encouragesuccess is the sixth rule. Everyone loves 8.(hear ) about true success stories of others to build confidenceand motivation. 9.(Recognize ) and 10.( applaud) achievement is the seventh rule. A goodleader tries to look for strengths in people and catch them doing something right so that he/she can compliment them.The eighth rule is to employ a mixture of positive and negative reinforcement. 11.(Express) praise is onlyone of many methods to motivate.
