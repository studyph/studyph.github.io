In SMART goal setting, S stands for specific which means you should write exactly what you want to achieve. _________ 2. The Principle of Frequency states that you must perform physical exercise more than normal amounts to get an improvement. _________ 3. The Principle of Progression says that you need to gradually increase both the intensity and duration of your physical training routine. _________ 4. Exercise program is a planned activity detailing a range of physical exercises and the amount of time each exercise should be spent for rest. _________ 5. If you want to calculate your Target Heart Rate, you need to subtract your age from 220. _________ 6. In the Principle of Variation, different exercises are included in the routine that are also applicable for the desired outcome of the training. _________ 7. A SMART goal is something that you want to do further in the future and requires time and planning. _________ 8. If you want to get your body ready for more strenuous activities and make it easier to exercise, you should do warm up exercises first. _________ 9. A SMART goal means that your goal is special, measurable, achievable, reliable, and time bound. _________ 10. Static exercises are more appropriate in the cool down as they help muscles to relax, realign muscle fibers to make it easier to exercise. __________ 11. The Principle of Recovery states that the rest periods between physical training are just as important as the training itself. __________ 12. The Resting Heart Rate is the number of heart beats per minute while you’re at rest. _________ 13. The fitness principle that states a specific muscle group is improved by matching the actions of the game/event is called Principle of Variation. __________ 14. Short term goals are achievable in a shorter amount of time. _________ 15. In an exercise program, frequency is the number of times one should exercise to improve a specific fitness component.​</a>
