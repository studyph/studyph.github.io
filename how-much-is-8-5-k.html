Materials needed. 2 plastic cups, plastic spoon or stirrer sand and water Do the following: 1. Mix sand in a cup of water. Stir the mixture thoroughly. 2. Let the mixture stand for a few minutes. Observe what happens. 3. Carefully pour the water in another cup. Sand Water Spoon Think Critically: 1. Describe the appearance of the mixture produced. 2. What type of mixture was created? 3. What happened to the components of the mixture after letting it stand undisturbed for a few minutes? 4. Explain why it happens? 5.Can you give 3 examples of mixtures that can be separated in the same way? The method you used to separate the mixture of sand and water is called decantation.

                        <p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The number is <strong>5</strong>. (11 - 6 = 5)</p><p></p><p>2. The number is <strong>15</strong>. (15 - 9 = 6)</p><p></p><p>3. The other number is <strong>8</strong>. (23 - 15 = 8)</p><p></p><p>4. The number is <strong>6</strong>. (42 ÷ 7 = 6)</p><p></p><p>5. The area is 2.25. (Perimeter = 4s, where s is the side length of the square. 9 = 4s, s = 2.25. Area = s² = 2.25² = 5.0625)</p><p></p><p>6. The regular price was <strong>P130</strong>. (Regular price - P10 = P120, Regular price = P130)</p><p></p><p>7. The other item costs <strong>P5</strong>. (P11 + P5 = P16)</p><p></p><p>8. Doy needs <strong>4 more points.</strong> (21 - 17 = 4)</p><p></p><p>9. Lino earns P300 /hour. (P1500 ÷ 5 = P300)</p><p></p><p>10. Arnel bought <strong>3 CDs</strong>. (P900 ÷ P300 = 3)</p><p>1. The number is 5.</p><p>2. The number is 15.</p><p>3. The other number is 8.</p><p>4. The number is 6.</p><p>5. The area is 2.25.</p><p>6. The regular price was 130.</p><p>7. The other item costs 5.</p><p>8. He needs 4 more points to win the set.</p><p>9. Lino earns 300 pesos per hour.</p><p>10. Arnel bought 3 CDs.</p><p></p>Here are the explanations for each answer:<p></p><p>1. If a number increased by 6 is equal to 11, we can subtract 6 from 11 to get the original number: 11 - 6 = 5. Therefore, the number is 5.</p><p>2. If a number decreased by 9 is equal to 6, we can add 9 to 6 to get the original number: 6 + 9 = 15. Therefore, the number is 15.</p><p>3. If the sum of two numbers is 23 and one of the numbers is 15, we can subtract 15 from 23 to get the other number: 23 - 15 = 8. Therefore, the other number is 8.</p><p>4. If the product of a number and 7 is equal to 42, we can divide 42 by 7 to get the number: 42 ÷ 7 = 6. Therefore, the number is 6.</p><p>5. If the perimeter of a square is 9, we can divide 9 by 4 to get the length of each side. 9 ÷ 4 = 2.25. The area of a square is the length of one side squared, so the area is 2.25 x 2.25 = 2.25.</p><p>6. If Mely paid P120 for a shirt that was reduced by P10, we can add P10 to P120 to get the regular price: P120 + P10 = P130. Therefore, the regular price was P130.</p><p>7. If together, two items cost P16 and one item costs P11, we can subtract P11 from P16 to get the cost of the other item: P16 - P11 = P5. Therefore, the other item costs P5.</p><p>8. If Doy now has 17 points and he needs 21 points to win the set, we can subtract 17 from 21 to get how many more points he needs: 21 - 17 = 4. Therefore, he needs 4 more points to win the set.</p><p>9. If Lino earned P1,500 for working 5 hours, we can divide P1,500 by 5 to get how much he earns each hour: P1,500 ÷ 5 = P300. Therefore, Lino earns P300 per hour.</p><p>10. If Arnel spent P900 on CDs that cost P300 each, we can divide P900 by P300 to get how many CDs he bought: P900 ÷ P300 = 3. Therefore, Arnel bought 3 CDs.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p></p><p>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</p><p></p>My goal in brainly is to get Genius<p></p>press Brainliest to support me &lt;3<br />

Are the ratios of male and female students proportional? Why or why not?pleas pa help po​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The ratio of width to length is:</p><p></p><p>width/length = 16 cm / 19 cm</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common factor of 16 and 19, we get:</p><p></p><p>width/length = 16/19</p><p></p><p>2. Let the three pieces be in the ratio 1x:2x:4x. Then the total length of the three pieces is:</p><p></p><p>1x + 2x + 4x = 7x</p><p></p><p>Since the total length is 28 cm, we can write:</p><p></p><p>7x = 28</p><p></p><p>x = 4</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the lengths of the three pieces are:</p><p></p><p>1x = 4 cm</p><p>2x = 8 cm</p><p>4x = 16 cm</p><p></p><p>3. If 2L of gas costs 44 pesos, then 1L of gas costs:</p><p></p><p>44 pesos / 2L = 22 pesos/L</p><p></p><p>Therefore, 4.5L of gas would cost:</p><p></p><p>4.5L * 22 pesos/L = 99 pesos</p><p></p><p>4. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Proportionality, we can write:</p><p></p><p>K/N = M/8</p><p></p><p>Cross-multiplying, we get:</p><p></p><p>8K = 6MN</p><p></p><p>Dividing both sides by 6, we get:</p><p></p><p>4/3K = MN</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the value of x is 4/3K.</p><p></p><p>5. To determine if the ratios of male and female students are proportional, we need to compare the ratio of male students who failed to the ratio of female students who failed. The ratio of male students who failed is:</p><p></p><p>4/18 = 2/9</p><p></p><p>The ratio of female students who failed is:</p><p></p><p>3/21 = 1/7</p><p></p><p>To see if the ratios are proportional, we can simplify both ratios by dividing both sides by their greatest common factor:</p><p></p><p>2/9 = 2/9</p><p></p><p>1/7 = 1/7</p><p></p><p>Since the simplified ratios are equal, we can say that the ratios of male and female students who failed are proportional.</p><br />
