                                            6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</a>

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures? In this activity, you will also use the same. But this time, you will distinguish the similarities and Do you still remember the Venn Diagram that you have accomplished after analyzing the 2 differences between Harana and Balitaw by applying your understanding of its musical elements.

                            14. 6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</h2><br />

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures? In this activity, you will also use the same. But this time, you will distinguish the similarities and Do you still remember the Venn Diagram that you have accomplished after analyzing the 2 differences between Harana and Balitaw by applying your understanding of its musical elements.
