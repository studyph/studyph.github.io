will not let me be.
"If i were you"
but you know
I am not you
yet you will not let me be.
You meddle, interfere
in my affairs
as if they were yours
and you were me.
You are unfair, unwise,
foolish to think
that I can be you
talk, act and think like you.
God made me
He made you
for God's sake,
let me be.

“Count up the suitors for me, let me know
what men at arms are there, how many men.
I must put all my mind to it, to see
if we two by ourselves can take them on
or if we should look round for help.”
Based on this excerpt, what is the best prediction about what will happen next in the story?
Odysseus will make himself known to Penelope.
Odysseus will battle the suitors with Telemachus.
Odysseus will soon leave on another long voyage.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>One way to cure a problem like this is to tell this to your parents. They always have a solution on any problem. Second way is to make more time with your family. Third way is to make TRUE friends. Friends make you happy, share their thoughts with you, and make you SMILE.Fourth, watch funny videos, read comics,magazines,or books that makes you happy. Do this ways and you'll be more happy than you are today and, you'll be happy enough to forget this thoughts. I hope that I helped you<br />

                        CRITIQUE USING THE FEMINISM APPROACH<p></p><p>From a <strong>feminist </strong>point of view, this poem can be seen as a <strong>celebration </strong>of <strong>women's</strong> empowerment and their power to take control of their own lives and speak out for themselves. Nowadays, women don't have enough voice to acknowledge their position in <strong>society</strong>. </p>In despite discrimination and adversity, the poem shows women to be strong, resilient, and unshakable.<p>This poem is a<strong> stunning </strong>portrayal of a woman's resilience. It draws attention to the<strong> difficulties </strong>women experience in society and the various caring for others, parenting, and protective roles they play. It also <strong>highlights </strong>the idea of women as fighters who never give up in the face of suffering.</p><p>It clearly<strong> emphasizes </strong>the numerous<strong> hardships </strong>and<strong> obstacles</strong> that women confront in society. It demonstrates how women frequently shoulder the responsibility of providing care for others and forgoing their own needs to support their families and loved ones. </p><p><strong>Strength</strong>,<strong> resiliency</strong>, and <strong>resolving</strong> issues surrounded by difficulties can be considered as a powerful celebration for women with feminist principles.<strong> Honoring </strong>women's accomplishments in this situation creates a big impact on social justice and gender equality. </p><p></p><p>For more information regarding the Feminism approach, kindly click this link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9180194</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
