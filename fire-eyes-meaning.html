The Tyger
by William Blake
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And, when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
The archetypal image of fire is used frequently in this poem. This archetype represents danger.

B. Blake uses this archetype to show readers the importance of having courage.
C. This archetype reinforces the idea that unchecked power can be dangerous.
D. “Fire” supports the idea that danger is all around us; we must be vigilant or it will strike when we least expect it.</a>

                                            Activity: In 1. Read the passage from “Plato's Allegory of the Cave" (Critical thinking, Communication, Character) "Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others-only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him) (https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory) 2. What does this story mean? 3. How does this passage from Plato lielp you turn your attention toward the right thing (ie, truth, beauty, justice and goodness)? ​</a>

                                            I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

                                            1.	Read the passage from “Plato’s Allegory of the Cave”(Critical thinking, Communication, Character)“Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him)”.(https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory)2.

                            2. Read the poem.
The Tyger
by William Blake
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And, when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
The archetypal image of fire is used frequently in this poem. This archetype represents danger.
Which statement best explains how this archetype affects the meaning in this poem?

B. Blake uses this archetype to show readers the importance of having courage.
C. This archetype reinforces the idea that unchecked power can be dangerous.
D. “Fire” supports the idea that danger is all around us; we must be vigilant or it will strike when we least expect it.</h2><br />
                        its letter D.because the fire is around us so it can damage the others<br /><br /><br /><br />

                            6. Activity: In 1. Read the passage from “Plato's Allegory of the Cave" (Critical thinking, Communication, Character) "Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others-only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him) (https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory) 2. What does this story mean? 3. How does this passage from Plato lielp you turn your attention toward the right thing (ie, truth, beauty, justice and goodness)? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. This story shows us that people have a very limited perspective of the world. The men inside the cave did not know anything else since they had <strong>never been exposed to the outside world before</strong>. For them, reality existed only there. However, one of the them had the chance to explore the world outside of that cave and <strong>realized how little they actually knew</strong>.</p><p>It is hard to convince people who do not acknowledge that there are things they do not know. The free man was correct, but the others mocked him instead. They refused to even consider it since they were already used to their way of life. On top of that, he could no longer see the dark cave in the same way. Once you gain knowledge, <strong>people who do not understand will be hard to convince.</strong></p><p><strong>3. </strong>This passage has shown me that we should focus on doing the right thing no matter what. Even though other people will not always believe you, it is <strong>our resposibility to seek truth, justice, goodness, and beauty</strong>. After all, it expands our horizons and our possibilities. The story has also shown me that we should not keep ourselves trapped in our own echo chambers and always look beyond what we know.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This answer offers another interpretation of the Allegory of the Cave by Plato: https://brainly.ph/question/3195417</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" is a concept devised by the philosopher to ruminate on the nature of belief versus knowledge. The allegory states that there exists prisoners chained together in a cave. ... The prisoners watch these shadows, believing them to be real. Plato posits that one prisoner could become free</p><p></p><p>Who are the prisoners in the cave? The prisoners represent humans, particularly people who are immersed in the superficial world of appearances. ... In his allegory, Plato discusses a type of prisoner that is freed from their chains. Plato believes that these freed prisoners are the philosophers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In Plato's “Allegory of the Cave”, the cave, chains, and fire are used to demonstrate what prisoners lacked. Within Plato's Allegory the cave, chains, and fire represent the prisoners limitation to knowledge, free will, and truth</p><p></p><p>But the prisoners think that he is dangerous because the information that he tells them is so abstract and opposed to what they know. The prisoners choose not to be free because they are comfortable in their own world of ignorance, and they are hostile to people who want to give them an alternative view of the world.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Read the passage from "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"(Critical thinking, Communication, Character)"Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire,with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have alwaysbeen chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth andthe echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and draggedoutside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But,eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even thesun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadowsof real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life inchains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discoverywith the others-only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble atfirst re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violentlyresisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to killhim)”.

                            21. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />
