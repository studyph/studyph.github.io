Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit. question?

1. Why is waste management important?
2. Sustainability means using the materials we have without consuming the materials intended for the future. How can the 5Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repair, and Recover) of waste management promote environmental sustainability?
3. Before, waste management was about segregating materials into biodegradable and non-biodegradable only. Is this enough? Prove you answer.
4. Provide a situation that can differentiate recycling from reusing materials.
5. Water is considered renewable, but the government is always obliging the society to save and conserve water. How can the 5Rs of waste management promote the conservation of water?</a>

Rain is the subject of prayer, the kind gesture of saints. Dear City, explain your irreverence: in you, rain is a visitor with nowhere to go. Where is the ground that knows only the love of water? What are the passageways to your heart? Pity the water that stays and rises on the streets, pity the water that floods into houses, so dark and filthy and heavy with rats and dead leaves and plastic. How ashamed water is to be what you have made it. What have you done to its beauty, its graceful body in pictures of oceans, its clear face in a glass? We walk home and cannot see our feet in the flood. We forget to thank the gods for their kindness. We look for someone to blame and turn to you, wretched city, because we are men and women of honor, we feed our children three meals a day, we never miss an election. The only explanation is you, dear city. This is the end of our discussion. There is no other culprit. question?

                            28. Can you answer? Thank you
1. Why is waste management important?
2. Sustainability means using the materials we have without consuming the materials intended for the future. How can the 5Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repair, and Recover) of waste management promote environmental sustainability?
3. Before, waste management was about segregating materials into biodegradable and non-biodegradable only. Is this enough? Prove you answer.
4. Provide a situation that can differentiate recycling from reusing materials.
5. Water is considered renewable, but the government is always obliging the society to save and conserve water. How can the 5Rs of waste management promote the conservation of water?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Having a proper waste management can result in the availability of valuable materials to reuse. ... It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources. Finally, waste management is also important for public healt</p><p>2.What is Waste? As citizens of a society we have a responsibility to manage our waste sustainably. We can do this following the five R's of waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle, recover and residual management.</p><p>3.</p><p>4.Recycling means turning an item into raw materials which can be used again, usually for a completely new product. This is an energy consuming procedure. Reusing refers to using an object as it is without treatment. This reduces pollution and waste, thus making it a more sustainable process</p><p>5.</p><p>carry on learning</p><br />
