________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

Each child also has the right to be nurtured by a family, to engage in recreation, and to be educated. The figures on the previous page tell us that many children are living in very unacceptable conditions. There are many organizations that are responsible for protecting children and making sure their rights are not violated. The Department of Social Welfare and Development, or DSWD, is one of these organizations. There are also private organizations like the Bantay Bata program of ABS-CBN. These organizations rescue children from situations in which their rights are being violated. Many times, these organizations provide shelter and care to these children. Usually, people call these organizations to report violations of children's rights, and then representatives from these organizations will come to pick up the child. Can you identify some organizations in your community that are responsible for protecting children's rights? Write down the name of each organization as well as the contact number of each. If you can, try to ask a representative from each organization how they help protect children's rights. Write your answer in the spaces below.​</a>

Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</a>

(CNN Philippines, April 21, 2020). Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION   EVIDENCE   CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

(CMI Philippines, April 21, 2020) Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

                        ➛Question:<p>How does the values education program contribute to the development of students' character and citizenship?</p><p></p>Answer:<p>Values education programs aim to instill a set of positive values and attitudes in students, helping them to develop a strong sense of character and good citizenship. These programs provide a structured framework for teaching students about important values such as respect, responsibility, honesty, fairness, empathy, and compassion. One of the ways that values education programs contribute to the development of students' character is by helping them to develop a strong sense of self-awareness and self-discipline. By teaching students the importance of personal responsibility, values education programs encourage students to take ownership of their actions and to be accountable for their decisions. Values education programs also promote the development of social skills and emotional intelligence. By teaching students to respect others and to show empathy and compassion towards their peers, these programs help students to develop positive relationships with others and to become more effective communicators.</p><p></p><br />

Long-term violent insurgencies have continued for decades, though their threat to the state has diminished in recent years. Impunity remains the norm for violent crimes against activists and journalists, and President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs since 2016 has led to thousands of extrajudicial killings.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />
