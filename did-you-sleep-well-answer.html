Aling Sita always says well your children are well taking good care I work all day to feed them clean them up and let them sleep buwahaya was very grateful to aling sita with a good deed showing to her children as a sign of gratitude mother crocodile daily brings her delicious food to eat. One day Buwahaya was so curious on how the old lady takes good care of her two little babies she secretly hid behind and observed what the old lady does when she was out as usual Aling Sita sits all day and b the babies when they don't sleep when the babies are about to sleep she isang them a lullaby la la la sleep now ugly crocodiles you are both awful your smell is so unpleasant I hate crocodiles like you la la la hearing Aling Sita song Buwahaya grew in anger she went away and found food for her babies she also gathered food for Aling Sita but instead of delicious food buaya collected all the snakes near the river and place them in the basket for Aling Sita as soon as Buwahaya arrived home she handed the basket to Aling Sita this is for you i got the best food for you today i'm good you always doing for my babies thank you so much Aling Sita answered happily. Aling Sita opened the basket eagerly.

                                            The Lion and the Mouse
A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little
Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away,
ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw
angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and someday I will
surely repay you."
The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he
was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in
the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his
angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling
in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it
until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.
"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see
that even a Mouse can help a Lion."

                                            TASK 7Directions: Write a summary of The Battle of the Crabs.  Divide the text summary into a beginning, middle and end.The Battle of the CrabsOne day the land crabs had a meeting and one of them said:“What shall we do with the waves? They sing so loudly all the time that we cannot possibly sleep.”“Well,” answered one of the oldest of the crabs, “I think we should make war on them.”The others agreed to this, and it was decided that the next day all the male crabs should get ready to fight the waves. They started for the sea, as agreed, when they met a shrimp.“Where are you going, my friends?” asked the shrimp.“We are going to fight the waves,” answered the crabs, “for they make so much noise at night that we cannot sleep.”“I do not think you will succeed,” said the shrimp, “for the waves are very strong and your legs are so weak that even your bodies bend almost to the ground when you walk.” Wherewith he laughed loudly.This made the crabs very angry, and they pinched the shrimp until he promised to help them win the battle.Then they all went to the shore. But the crabs noticed that the eyes of the shrimp were set unlike their own, so they thought his must be wrong and they laughed at him and said:“Friend shrimp, your face is turned the wrong way. What weapon have you to fight with the waves?”“My weapon is a spear on my head,” replied the shrimp, and just then he saw a big wave coming and ran away. The crabs did not see it, however, for they were all looking toward the shore, and they were covered with water and drowned.By and by the wives of the crabs became worried because their husbands did not return, and they went down to the shore to see if they could help in the battle. No sooner had they reached the water, however, than the waves rushed over them and killed them.Sometime after this thousands of little crabs appeared near the shore, and the shrimp often visited them and told them of the sad fate of their parents. Even today these little crabs can be seen on the shore, continually running back and forth. They seem to rush down to fight the waves, and then, as their courage fails, they run back to the land where their forefathers lived. They neither live on dry land, as their ancestors did, nor in the sea where the other crabs are, but on the beach where the waves wash over them at high tide and try to dash them to pieces.​</a>

The Man and his Camel
Once there was a man who had a greedy camel. One cold night, the ma went to sleep in his tent. He heard a noise. He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent.
"Master!" said the camel. It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there."
The man answered, "You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside."
A little later, the camel said, "Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?" The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel's front legs. The camel was happy but not for long.
"Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the comer so that I can get them in." The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all
"Master, there isn't any room in the tent. I cannot turn," said the greedy camel. There isn't enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside."
The man sat up and looked at his camel. "I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?" he said as the camel pushed him into the cold

                                            That evening Alexa complained to her parents. Her mom was outrageous that the Director/Choreographer did not include her daughter in the team But Alexa's father suggested the maybe the Director/Choreographer had a point. Alexa went upstairs stormed in a huff and slammed the door of the room. Leaving the parents on the living room while having a big argument. Alexa couldn't sleep that night. She is planning to ignore the girls as well as the Director/choreographer starting tomorrow. The school team would probably lose this yearl And, it the dance choreographer's fault, for not picking her! Yet, in as much as she tried to stay away from the dance studio, she could not stay away with it because it is her passion! So, she still practiced every day, careful to stay out of the team's way. At first, she felt satisfied to see the girls on the team struggling. But then it started to bother her for a different reason. One day, after watching lea do the routine repeatedly unperfect. She approached Lea and explained what she must do to do it nicely. Lea did as Alexa suggested, and immediately show some improvements. Alexa felt good inside as she went on with her practice -alone and lonely. She didn't notice the Choreographer across the room, watching her. Over the next few weeks, If Alexa had an opportunity to help on of the girls, she did it without expecting anything. She no longer thinking of joining the team. She just worked hard day after day, for hours, pushing her limits harder and harder. The dance team competed again and again and each time the girls did a little bit of improvement. Once, they even won the contest! "We couldn't have done this without Alexa's help," the girls said to one another in their locker room. The following year, Alexa tried out for the dance team again. This time, when the girls cheered her, she did a good job, she just thanked them, and sit back silently. When the choreographer posted the list on bulletin board, Alexa approached with apprehension. She was sure the Choreographer much hate her and she is not expecting her name to be appeared on the list. But there was her name, on the list! Her hard work had paid-off- but not the hard work she had put in learning complicated dance moves. When she showed up for the practice the following day, the choreographer smiled at her, she knew it was the hard work of becoming a better team player that was responsible for her success. a Let Us Practice: A. Answer the following questions, briefly. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happened? 3. What is the first big event that happened in the story? 4. What comes next after Alexa find out that she is not included in the team? 5. Did she truly ignore the rest of the team, since then? Why? 6. If you were Alexa, will you still try your luck even though the choreographer does not like you, as a person? 7. Can you identify the climax of the story? What is it?​</a>

                            19. The Lion and the Mouse
A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little
Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away,
ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw
angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and someday I will
surely repay you."
The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he
was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in
the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his
angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling
in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it
until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.
"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see
that even a Mouse can help a Lion."

They sing so loudly all the time that we cannot possibly sleep.”“Well,” answered one of the oldest of the crabs, “I think we should make war on them.”The others agreed to this, and it was decided that the next day all the male crabs should get ready to fight the waves. They started for the sea, as agreed, when they met a shrimp.“Where are you going, my friends?” asked the shrimp.“We are going to fight the waves,” answered the crabs, “for they make so much noise at night that we cannot sleep.”“I do not think you will succeed,” said the shrimp, “for the waves are very strong and your legs are so weak that even your bodies bend almost to the ground when you walk.” Wherewith he laughed loudly.This made the crabs very angry, and they pinched the shrimp until he promised to help them win the battle.Then they all went to the shore. But the crabs noticed that the eyes of the shrimp were set unlike their own, so they thought his must be wrong and they laughed at him and said:“Friend shrimp, your face is turned the wrong way. What weapon have you to fight with the waves?”“My weapon is a spear on my head,” replied the shrimp, and just then he saw a big wave coming and ran away. The crabs did not see it, however, for they were all looking toward the shore, and they were covered with water and drowned.By and by the wives of the crabs became worried because their husbands did not return, and they went down to the shore to see if they could help in the battle. No sooner had they reached the water, however, than the waves rushed over them and killed them.Sometime after this thousands of little crabs appeared near the shore, and the shrimp often visited them and told them of the sad fate of their parents. Even today these little crabs can be seen on the shore, continually running back and forth. They seem to rush down to fight the waves, and then, as their courage fails, they run back to the land where their forefathers lived. They neither live on dry land, as their ancestors did, nor in the sea where the other crabs are, but on the beach where the waves wash over them at high tide and try to dash them to pieces.​</h2><br />
