                        •hog/pig<br />-Swine by-products are also important parts of products such as water filters, insulation, rubber, antifreeze, certain plastics, floor waxes, crayons, chalk, adhesives and fertilizer. Lard is fat from pig abdomens and is used in shaving creams, soaps, make-up, baked goods and other foods.<br /><br />•cow<br />-Perhaps, meat, hamburger, steak or even leather. These are all products of the beef animal (or cattle), but there are also many other byproducts. Beef byproducts are the products that we get from beef cattle that might not be quite so obvious. For example, soap is a beef byproduct because it uses beef fat.<br /><br />•goat<br />-The chemical characteristics of goat milk can be used to manufacture a wide variety of products, including fluid beverage products (low fat, fortified, or flavored) and UHT (ultra high temperature) milk, fermented products such as cheese, buttermilk or yogurt, frozen products such as ice cream or frozen yogurt, butter, and more.<br /><br />•tilapia<br />-The by-products generated from industrial filleting of tilapia can produce other products such as surimi (minced fish) or gluten free tapioca starch. Both products could be obtained from mechanically recovered fish meat that otherwise would be discharged into the environment.<br /><br />•duck<br />-High-value products from ducks and geese include liver pate, down feathers and smoked meat products. Tongues and feet products are also used as a delicacy, mostly exported to Hong Kong, although some are used by Asian Americans.<br /><br />Ps: i hope it helps:))<br />

                            29. 8. Which of the following by-products of photosynthesis is being utilized by animals? A. Carbohydrates B. Water C. Oxygen D. Sugar9. Animal cell are smaller than plant cell in size. Is the statement about cell size true?A. no, because plants and animal cell have the same size.B. no because plants and animals have the same parts.C. yes, because plants have larger central vacuole that function as storage.D. yes, because plant cell is rectangular in shape and animal are spherical that make it different.answer my questions right... please ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>8. C. OXYGEN</p><p>9. B. NO, BECAUSE PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PARTS</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nag Basa pako Nyan hehe </p><p>sana makatulong</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>8. C.Oxygen, However that isn't the only benefit of photosynthesis for animals. There's a product other than glucose that comes out of photosynthesis: OXYGEN. Animals breathe oxygen every minute of every day, and we breathe out carbon dioxide. It's photosynthesis that turns that carbon dioxide back into oxygen.</p><p></p><p>9. D. yes, because plant cell is rectangular in shape and animal are spherical that make it different, Plant cells can be larger than animal cells. The normal range for an animal cell varies from 10 to 30 micrometers while that for a plant cell stretches from 10 to 100 micrometers. Beyond size, the main structural differences between plant and animal cells lie in a few additional structures found in plant cells.</p><br />
