                            1. a speech for WORLD PEACE :)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>﻿Look around you. Observe the world you are living in. Can you feel the beating of a thousand desperate hearts? Can you see the fear for tomorrow in the looks of people? Can you hear the cries of a thousand mothers who are losing their children each day?  </p><p>
</p><p>Now ask yourself, is this the place without the centuries and years, this the place where each child expects to grow up when they open their innocent eyes and see the world for the first time? Are you able to look in the eyes of those children without the feeling of shame for this reality full of evil, which they have to face?</p><p>
</p><p>We cannot deny the simple truth that we were the ones who have been constantly shaping this reality. But another simple truth is that it is not too late to change something. We can make this world a better place if we try. So why not to create good instead of evil? Why not to make peace instead of war? Why not to spread love and compassion instead of hate and arrogance?
</p><p>
</p><p>No one is born with evil within. We are born, filled with love towards everyone and everything around us. But instead of just following our hearts full of light, we keep feeding ourselves with darkness over and over again. When did we stop judging people by their personality and started to consider the color of their skin? What urged us to acknowledge someone as an enemy just because of the place they were born in? Isn’t Earth the only place all of us were born in? Are the borders that someone has drawn on the map powerful enough to build in our souls the borders of prejudice, alienating us from each other? Yes, they are! As long as we let them be. As long as we teach our children to let them be powerful enough. </p><p>
</p><p>When the world and this life are nearly destroyed by the evil and hate we spread, we would hardly care about the power we have towards others. We would hardly care about the God others are praying for, as long as those prayers can give us a chance to survive. So why won’t we stop caring about it right now, at this very moment? Why won’t we start making this world a better place by creating peace and compassion? And finally, why won’t we earn the right to look at our children’s eyes with the feeling of pride for the world we have built for them?  </p><p>
</p><p>Think about these questions and, no doubt, you will find the answers. Because the answers to those questions are buried deep inside each one of us. And we will discover those answers as soon as we dispel the dust of evil and hate from our hearts...</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><p>Make it brainlist please if you like my answer :))</p><br />

                            2. speech for WORLD PEACE​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Peace is liked by all. It is for peace that we pray to God every morning and evening. Peace hath her victories no less glorious than war. It is in peace time that we have great men, high thoughts and golden deeds. Peace encourages education, trade, commerce and industry. Greater than personal peace is the peace of the nation and still greater is the world peace. This is possible when there is no war in any corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>        Unfortunately the world peace was badly disturbed twice. The beast in man was uppermost then. The World War I was fought, as they said, to end war. Its results were horrible. One third of the world population was killed. At its close the League of Nations was set up at Geneva. Its aim was to check war in future. But it had no power. The World War II came in 1939 and lasted up to 1945. Hitler and Mussolini threw every code of human morality to wind. But they were defeated in the end.</p><p></p><p>        The U.N.O. was set up at California. It was aimed with and international army. The big four powers were given veto power. Since its birth it has been trying its best to check war and to safe-guard the fundamental rights of man. It has declared its objectives. But unfortunately, the Big four make use of it as a platform to further national ends. Cold war is going on. They are fighting ldeoligical war. Inspite of several top meetings for disarmament, there is still a race for nuclear weapons. Tests and explosions have not been checked. The world is now all the mouth of a volcano.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Good afternoon everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>Peace is something good for the world. </strong>How can we feel it? We can feel it when our family is around us, and our relationship with our friends and neighbors is happy or joyful. Our desire to love or cherish, accept or strengthen relationships, that's when we feel peace.</p><p>Also, that peace means following what our hearts say, and it means close trust and respect for those around me. Peace begins with oneself, so I end this speech by stating, "Peace begins with a smile".</p><p>In principle, each individual has different thoughts, different interests, and different destinies, then what do we gain from all this, with this world peace day if we make it happen with the reality of real peace so that we all feel comfortable wrapped in beauty without hostility?</p><p>Talking about this world peace day cannot be separated from a historical meaning of the occurrence of this day of peace, precisely in 1981 including Israel and Palestine, on 21 September the United Nations determined a world peace day, namely the celebration of world peace day on 21 September every year. </p><p>Apart from that, peace is a moral and a desire for all mankind, indeed life is full of risks but how can we create a culture of harmony and peace, that let us maintain peace between humans and hopefully on this day of world peace is not just a mere slogan, but we create and apply it from the smallest thing, namely from ourselves.</p><p><strong>Dear peace officer, thank you for your dedication to maintaining, fighting for, and defending world peace. </strong>Without the efforts and sacrifices of peace officer, perhaps the world would be in a worse situation. Thank you and best appreciation to peace officer.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you and good afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more at https://brainly.ph/question/29350348</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear fellow students and faculty members,</p><p></p><p>I am standing before you today as a candidate for the position of Treasurer in our Student Government. If elected, I will work tirelessly to ensure that our student body is financially secure and that our organization operates efficiently.</p><p></p><p>But I want to take a moment to speak to you about something equally important to me: peace advocacy. As students, we often get caught up in our goals and ambitions, but we cannot forget about society's more significant issues. One of the most pressing issues is the need for peace.</p><p></p><p>We live in a world plagued by conflict at home and abroad. From the ongoing pandemic to wars and competition worldwide, it is clear that peace is something we desperately need. As a student leader, I believe it is our responsibility to use our voices and resources to advocate for peace.</p><p></p><p>As Treasurer, I will make it a priority to allocate funds to organizations that are working toward peace and conflict resolution. I will also work with other student leaders to organize events and initiatives promoting peace within our school community.</p><p></p><p>But I cannot do this alone. I need your support and your vote to make this vision a reality. Together, we can make a difference and create a more peaceful world for ourselves and future generations.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your time, and I hope I can count on your vote for Treasurer and peace advocacy.</p><p></p><br />

                            5. Help me to make an speech about this quote by The Dalai Lama. "When we have inner peace, we can be at peace withthose around us. When our community is in a state of peace, it can share that peace with neighboring communities."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"<strong>Ladies and gentlemen,</strong></p><p></p><p>When we have inner peace, we are able to approach the world and those around us with a sense of calm and understanding. Our ability to handle stress and difficult situations improves, and we are better able to connect with others on a deeper level.</p><p></p><p>But inner peace doesn't just benefit us as individuals; it also has a ripple effect on our community. When we are at peace with ourselves, we are able to better understand and relate to those around us. This leads to healthier relationships, more open communication, and a greater sense of community.</p><p></p><p>When our community is in a state of peace, it can share that peace with neighboring communities. We become a shining example of how different people can come together and live in harmony. And as the peace in one community spreads, it can create a chain reaction that leads to peace in our entire country and the world.</p><p></p><p>So, let us strive for inner peace, not just for ourselves, but for the betterment of our community and society as a whole.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good evening everyone,</p><p></p><p>As we gather here today, I would like to share with you a quote from one of the world's most respected spiritual leaders, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He once said, "When we have inner peace, we can be at peace with those around us. When our community is in a state of peace, it can share that peace with neighboring communities."</p><p></p><p>This quote speaks to the power of inner peace and its ability to positively impact not only our individual lives, but also the lives of those around us and even entire communities. When we are at peace within ourselves, we are able to interact with others in a more positive and compassionate way. This, in turn, can create a ripple effect of peace throughout our community, and beyond.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that inner peace is not something that can be achieved overnight or by simply wishing for it. It takes consistent effort and commitment to cultivate inner peace, whether it be through meditation, mindfulness, or other spiritual practices.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it's also important to remember that inner peace is not something that can be achieved in isolation. It is closely tied to the well-being of our community and the world around us. That's why it's important to work towards creating a more peaceful society in which everyone can thrive.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the quote of The Dalai Lama reminds us that inner peace is not only important for our individual well-being, but also for the well-being of our community and world. So let us strive to cultivate inner peace within ourselves and work towards creating a more peaceful society for all.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><br />

                        <strong>Peace can't be achieved unless we do not have it in ourselves. Peace starts with us and will eventually spread to everyone around us.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>UNMIT Police officers trainingArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to “bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.” The rule of law ensures that international law and the principles of justice apply equally to all States and are equally adhered to. Respect for the rule of law generates an enabling environment for achieving the purposes of the Charter.</p><p></p><p>The Charter provides the normative basis for friendly relations between States. Together with the wider body of international law, it provides a structure for the conduct of international relations. It creates reciprocity between States as sovereign equals, accords predictability and legitimacy to their actions within an agreed multilateral system and provides a means to resolve disputes arising. Of particular importance to peace and security are the principles of territorial integrity, non-use of threat or force in any manner inconsistent with the Charter and the commitment to implementation of international legal obligations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When individuals are able to find inner peace and contentment within themselves, they are more likely to be able to interact with others in a peaceful and harmonious way. When a community is able to cultivate a sense of peace and unity within its own borders, it is more likely to be able to extend that peace to other communities and promote peace on a larger scale.</p><p></p><p>Inner peace is often thought of as a state of mental and emotional calm and well-being, and it is often seen as an essential precursor to peace in relationships and communities. When individuals are able to find inner peace, they are better able to navigate the challenges and stresses of daily life and interact with others in a more positive and constructive way. Similarly, when a community is able to cultivate a sense of peace and harmony, it is more likely to be able to resolve conflicts and work together towards common goals. By promoting inner peace and peaceful communities, it is possible to create a ripple effect that can lead to greater peace on a wider scale.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Peace is the path we take for bringing growth and prosperity to society. If we do not have peace and harmony, achieving political strength, economic stability and cultural growth will be impossible. Moreover, before we transmit the notion of peace to others, it is vital for us to possess peace within. It is not a certain individual’s responsibility to maintain peace but everyone’s duty.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        For me, this means that when we feel like we're all calm and there's nothing to worry about ourselves in an individual sense, we pass off the laid-backness to the people we are with. So the same goes when a whole community is at a serenity state and condition, it can influence other big pictures to follow or be with them (the community) as well.<br />

                            23. Write an original speech about peace and patriotism.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>OPTION 1</strong></p><p>Today we gathered here to pay homage to the ones who gave away their lives to safeguard ours. As all of you know, we have gathered here today, to commemorate our freedom fighters, their victories, and their sacrifices in the freedom struggle. I am glad that our respected Principal has asked me to say a few words on patriotism today in front of you all.</p><p></p><p>So, when we have to talk about the freedom struggle and patriotism a few names naturally come to our minds, but today I like like to put talk more about the one whose names are not well known. We hear a great deal about leaders who hold the baton and took the fight forward, but in highlighting the greatness often to tend to overlook the simple the natural and yet complex of all, nature of humans. We always talk about the leaders, but what makes a leader, if not his followers. A struggle that took the lives of thousands, yet we tend to glorify only a few. If we want to show love to our country and its people, we need to recognize the importance of acknowledgment. We the people need to show gratitude towards not just the one who is being talked about, instead we need to dig deep to find the unsung heroes or heroines.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here, I am not trying to deteriorate any individual or question the leadership of any, but instead, I want to focus on the fact that when we see a glorified individual or say a hero/ heroine, it is more often a team effort. We need to recognize team efforts and focus our energy on building teams. It’s good to have leadership quality, but what good a leader is without his/her team.</p><p></p><p>So for me, patriotism is more of the celebration of a team irrespective of political, geographical, religious, racial, and various other differences. And today, on this proud day, I urge my students to shift their energy from individuals to groups, towards collaboration. As rightly said together, we stand, divided we fall. Hence, patriotism is the togetherness, the zeal, the efforts we put towards our fellow companion in times of distress and in times of prosperity.
</p><p>
</p><p>So I would like to conclude my speech on the note of togetherness. And would request all present here on this great day to think about the importance of collectivity and how it is going to impact us and with genuine patriotism, we humans as a whole can do wonders.
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time. I wish you all a great life ahead!</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong><strong>option 2</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As you all know that today is the day we had received our independence from the British in 1947. And like every year, today also we all gathered here to celebrate the day and to pay tribute to our freedom fighters, all the great people for their sacrifice and to learn from their patriotism, their sheer love towards the country.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>I am truly honoured to get this opportunity to speak on patriotism on this very day. A country like India with such huge human resources, there’s nothing that we cannot achieve as a country. What we need is to infuse the youth with the right form of patriotism. So what is Patriotism? Answer to that is nothing but love and the zeal to do something towards your countrymen. I have always believed in the good of this great land and forever thankful to the ones that have sacrificed their lives so that we could breathe independently. Great people like Mahatma Gandhi, Rajguru and Sukhdev, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Shahid Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, and many more saints struggled for this day. So we must honour their sacrifice and work every day towards making this great country even more significant.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Often we get to see the young generations speaking ill about the country, and they don’t appreciate the hardship the struggle our forefathers went through so that we could be finally independent. It’s high time we recognize the sacrifice and focus our energy towards building this great nation of ours.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Patriotism is not just sharing a post on your social media handle; it is instead of how we act towards the need of our fellow countrymen. It is the efforts on the ground we put into making this country more exceptional in all possible aspects; patriotism is loving your country and proving it time and again. When you are a patriot, you need to demonstrate it by your actions, and this is our prime duty as a citizen of this great country. It is the call we all need to answer, and we need to prove why we deserve the country we need to make my freedom fighters proud in heaven. The sacrifices they have done for us cannot go to waste.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So, on this very day, I would urge all of you to act, to recognize the sacrifice and do the needful whenever you see an opportunity to prove your love for the country do it. The country needs our love and sacrifice to grow and prosper, and it is our duty to do the needful.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            24. as a journalist you are task to make a speech about world peace </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>World Peace</strong></p><p></p><p>Peace is liked by all. It is for peace that we pray to God every morning and evening. Peace hath her victories no less glorious than war. It is in peace time that we have great men, high thoughts and golden deeds. Peace encourages education, trade, commerce and industry. Greater than personal peace is the peace of the nation and still greater is the world peace. This is possible when there is no war in any corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately the world peace was badly disturbed twice. The beast in man was uppermost then. The World War I was fought, as they said, to end war. Its results were horrible. One third of the world population was killed. At its close the League of Nations was set up at Geneva. Its aim was to check war in future. But it had no power. The World War II came in 1939 and lasted up to 1945. Hitler and Mussolini threw every code of human morality to wind. But they were defeated in the end.</p><p></p><p>The U.N.O. was set up at California. It was aimed with and international army. The big four powers were given veto power. Since its birth it has been trying its best to check war and to safe-guard the fundamental rights of man. It has declared its objectives. But unfortunately, the Big four make use of it as a platform to further national ends. Cold war is going on. They are fighting ldeoligical war. Inspite of several top meetings for disarmament, there is still a race for nuclear weapons. Tests and explosions have not been checked. The world is now all the mouth of a volcano.</p><p></p><p>No one wants war, for if war comes this time, it will mean the end of mankind. There will be no victor to enjoy the fruits of victory. Men like Bertrand Russel have advocated One World Govt. But selfish politicians are not ready to sink their personal and national interests. Some think that war is a biological need. Man is a fighter first. So we have no hope from man. It is why Mahatma Gandhi said that woman alone can give peace. She is the incarnation of Ahimsa, having infinite love and an infinite capacity for service and sacrifice. She can give the nectar of love to the children.</p><br />
