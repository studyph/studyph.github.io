At this time, let us see how well you know about text structure and graphic organizer.
DIRECTIONS. Read the passages below and identify how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, put the information from each passage into the graphic organizer. The following graphic organizers are examples. Feel free to make changes if necessary.
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

                            2. Activity 4 Map It Out
At this time, let us see how well you know about text structure and graphic organizer.
DIRECTIONS. Read the passages below and identify how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, put the information from each passage into the graphic organizer. The following graphic organizers are examples. Feel free to make changes if necessary.
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
