A new book seeks some answers.1 What is the universe made of? ...2 How did life begin? ...3 Are we alone in the universe? ...4 What makes us human? ...5 What is consciousness? ...6 Why do we dream? ...7 Why is there stuff? ...8 Are there other universes?The first 3 Questions with answer:1. What is the universe made of?Astronomers face an embarrassing conundrum: they don’t know what 95% of the universe is made of. Atoms, which form everything we see around us, only account for a measly 5%. Over the past 80 years it has become clear that the substantial remainder is comprised of two shadowy entities – dark matter and dark energy. The former, first discovered in 1933, acts as an invisible glue, binding galaxies and galaxy clusters together. Unveiled in 1998, the latter is pushing the universe’s expansion to ever greater speeds. Astronomers are closing in on the true identities of these unseen interlopers.2. How did life begin?Four billion years ago, something started stirring in the primordial soup. A few simple chemicals got together and made biology – the first molecules capable of replicating themselves appeared. We humans are linked by evolution to those early biological molecules. But how did the basic chemicals present on early Earth spontaneously arrange themselves into something resembling life? How did we get DNA? What did the first cells look like? More than half a century after the chemist Stanley Miller proposed his “primordial soup” theory, we still can’t agree about what happened. Some say life began in hot pools near volcanoes, others that it was kick-started by meteorites hitting the sea.3. Are we alone in the universe?science 3Perhaps not. Astronomers have been scouring the universe for places where water worlds might have given rise to lifever asked. ​</a>

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

                                            GRADE 10 ENGLISHB. NAME IT Arrange and rewrite the paragraphs in logical order. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. 1. By staying home (and still we are apart at that) yet together. It is like being near yet so far. By doing so we were able to discern how much time we have lost and not spent together with our dear ones before the pandemic struck. It is true indeed that we do not know the values of someone or something until it or he/she is gone. We cannot hold back the time, we cannot stop the clock from running, we cannot hold back the dawning of a new tomorrow. Cliche as it may seem, time is really gold. It is important. It is precious. 2. COVID19 - the Pandemic That Made Us Close. 3. This pandemic brought us down to this realization that our loved ones are just around the corner (oftentimes neglected, forsaken, taken for granted). We realized their importance and value all of the sudden. We made a pact to spend more time with them as much as we can. We realized that we have a lot catching up to do and make up for those times that we were not there whether during their highs and lows. We realized this and that while we were confined in the comforts of our homes as we were required as mandated by stricter quarantine protocols. 4. We don't want to say "Hey thank you COVID, because of you I became closer to my loved ones". The truth is that we have COVID to thank for because it actually made us closer to one another whether we accept it or not. If there is really one thing to be thankful for - it's the fact that because of this pandemic we became truly closer. Made sense? I bet right! Thank you COVID, but no! Thanks, but no thanks! 5. Every tick and nick of time seems to be of great value as we race against time in order to get rid of this pandemic through a vaccine. As that vaccine remains to be elusive, people and their families need to stay home together in order to prevent the virus from spreading further and farther. It is staying apart (social distancing) that actually made us closer together. 6. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 19 may have torn the world apart, but unexpectedly it actually made people and their families closer together. Why did it take a pandemic in order for us to get closer to one another especially to our loved ones? It is undeniably due to the pandemic that made us realized how important family ties are. Time is indeed of an essence since this pandemic broke out late last year. 7. By: Christine Joy G. Aquino​</a>

                            17.  The 20 big questions in scienceFrom the nature of the universe (that's if there is only one) to the purpose of dreams, there are lots of things we still don't know – but we might do soon. A new book seeks some answers.1 What is the universe made of? ...2 How did life begin? ...3 Are we alone in the universe? ...4 What makes us human? ...5 What is consciousness? ...6 Why do we dream? ...7 Why is there stuff? ...8 Are there other universes?The first 3 Questions with answer:1. What is the universe made of?Astronomers face an embarrassing conundrum: they don’t know what 95% of the universe is made of. Atoms, which form everything we see around us, only account for a measly 5%. Over the past 80 years it has become clear that the substantial remainder is comprised of two shadowy entities – dark matter and dark energy. The former, first discovered in 1933, acts as an invisible glue, binding galaxies and galaxy clusters together. Unveiled in 1998, the latter is pushing the universe’s expansion to ever greater speeds. Astronomers are closing in on the true identities of these unseen interlopers.2. How did life begin?Four billion years ago, something started stirring in the primordial soup. A few simple chemicals got together and made biology – the first molecules capable of replicating themselves appeared. We humans are linked by evolution to those early biological molecules. But how did the basic chemicals present on early Earth spontaneously arrange themselves into something resembling life? How did we get DNA? What did the first cells look like? More than half a century after the chemist Stanley Miller proposed his “primordial soup” theory, we still can’t agree about what happened. Some say life began in hot pools near volcanoes, others that it was kick-started by meteorites hitting the sea.3. Are we alone in the universe?science 3Perhaps not. Astronomers have been scouring the universe for places where water worlds might have given rise to lifever asked. ​</h2><br />

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />

                            28. GRADE 10 ENGLISHB. NAME IT Arrange and rewrite the paragraphs in logical order. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. 1. By staying home (and still we are apart at that) yet together. It is like being near yet so far. By doing so we were able to discern how much time we have lost and not spent together with our dear ones before the pandemic struck. It is true indeed that we do not know the values of someone or something until it or he/she is gone. We cannot hold back the time, we cannot stop the clock from running, we cannot hold back the dawning of a new tomorrow. Cliche as it may seem, time is really gold. It is important. It is precious. 2. COVID19 - the Pandemic That Made Us Close. 3. This pandemic brought us down to this realization that our loved ones are just around the corner (oftentimes neglected, forsaken, taken for granted). We realized their importance and value all of the sudden. We made a pact to spend more time with them as much as we can. We realized that we have a lot catching up to do and make up for those times that we were not there whether during their highs and lows. We realized this and that while we were confined in the comforts of our homes as we were required as mandated by stricter quarantine protocols. 4. We don't want to say "Hey thank you COVID, because of you I became closer to my loved ones". The truth is that we have COVID to thank for because it actually made us closer to one another whether we accept it or not. If there is really one thing to be thankful for - it's the fact that because of this pandemic we became truly closer. Made sense? I bet right! Thank you COVID, but no! Thanks, but no thanks! 5. Every tick and nick of time seems to be of great value as we race against time in order to get rid of this pandemic through a vaccine. As that vaccine remains to be elusive, people and their families need to stay home together in order to prevent the virus from spreading further and farther. It is staying apart (social distancing) that actually made us closer together. 6. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 19 may have torn the world apart, but unexpectedly it actually made people and their families closer together. Why did it take a pandemic in order for us to get closer to one another especially to our loved ones? It is undeniably due to the pandemic that made us realized how important family ties are. Time is indeed of an essence since this pandemic broke out late last year. 7. By: Christine Joy G. Aquino​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. In everyday language, truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences. Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsehood.</p><p>truth, in metaphysics and the philosophy of language, the property of sentences, assertions, beliefs, thoughts, or propositions that are said, in ordinary discourse, to agree with the facts or to state what is the case.</p><p>Truth is a property not so much of thoughts and ideas but more properly of beliefs and assertions. But to believe or assert something is not enough to make it true, or else the claim that 'to believe something makes it true' would be just as true as the claim that 'to believe something does not make it true</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>TRUTH</strong> is the quality or state of being true.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>how do we know if something is true?</p><p></p><p><strong>•</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>accordance</strong><strong> </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>measurable </strong><strong>reality</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Examples </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>sentence:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&gt;</strong><strong>TRUTH&lt;</strong></p><p><strong>Could </strong><strong>there </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>TRUTH</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>Mary's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sus</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>icions.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&gt;</strong><strong>TRUE&lt;</strong></p><p><strong>It </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>really </strong><strong>difficult</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>find </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>TRUE </strong><strong>friend </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>life.</strong></p><br />
