It is a process whereby digested food materials are taken into the body- cells and are converted into new protoplasm or used to provide energy 6. It is the wavelike contraction of muscles that enables the food to travel through esophagus. 7. It is a F - shaped organ which lies beneath the diaphragm and partly covered by the liver that breaks down the food and dissolving its nutrients. 8. It is the process of intake of food inside the body. 9. It is the organ responsible for the absorption of nutrients from the food that we intake. 10. It is the passing of digested material out of the digestive tract. Directions: Arrange the process of digestion inside the human body starting from 1 and ends to 5. Write your answer on the space provided before the number. 11. The nutrients from the food that we intake travels to the fingerlike structure inside the small intestine called villi. 12. After the food travelled from the esophagus, it will break down so that the nutrients will be dissolved. 13. The undigested parts of food or those that were not absorbed by the body are eliminated as feces. 14. Food undergoes mastication and broken down by the enzyme called saliva. 15. Specific nutrients proceed to the cell to sustain the needs of the body.​</a>
