                                            Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</a>

                                            6. Using the formula shown below, calculate the wavelength of a signal from KPhET
98.7. Remember that FM stations transmit in the Megahertz range. This means that KPhET is
transmitting a frequency of 9.87 x 107 Hz. What is the wavelength of the signal from this radio
station?
c = λ v where c = 3.0 x108 m/s = Speed of light, v = frequency of the wave, and λ is
the wavelength.
7. My favorite radio station is NPR, which transmits a signal that has a wavelength of
3.38 m. What is the frequency of this signal? Remember, light speed is 3.0 x108 m/s.
8. Explain the mathematical relationship between wavelength, frequency and energy. How can
this be observed in a real-life scenario?
9. To Think About: For visible light (ROYGBIV), which has the shortest wavelength? Which
has the longest? Place all the other colors in order based on their wavelength from shortest to
longest.

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</a>

                            11. Read the following paragraphs and underline main idea.
1. The circle is the symbol of our existence and our life. It doesn’t have
beginning or ending and undoubtedly goes forever. Round and round
it goes, like a wheel that spins us for mysteries of human life.
2. Poverty has many hands, many forms. One of the hands has a foil and
to other, for many young people its bliss and escape, another hand
gambles. The most receptive reaches into the purses and bags in
search of cell phones and money. You may cut off all these hands
literally but still the problem is there. Government must do something
to eradicate poverty by all means to fully achieve development.
3. Enormous energy, enthusiasm, and organization drove the reform
efforts in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the
United States. But the “age of reform,” as some scholars have called it,
was not an American phenomenon alone. It was part of a wave of
social experimentation that was occurring through much of the
industrial world. “Progressivism” in other countries influenced the
social movements in the United States. And American reform, in turn,
had significant influence on other countries as well.
4. The real Filipino is being early or on the dot. We arrive at our offices
early; if there are people who come late, they are merely exceptions to
the rule and probably have their reasons behind it. Let’s stop insulting
ourselves by thinking that “Filipino time” is hopeless; being late does
not coil from race, color or origin. Surely there will be individual who
becomes late – Filipino or not.
5. Man is distinct from all other life forms in his intellectual faculties and
speech. He is born with highly planned and structured social system.
His brain and sensory organs are perfectly designed for
communication and cohabitation with others. This is a social
dimension of man that never stops to challenge every aspect of his
being.</h2><br />

There is no air or water, so there can be no life of any kind. There is scenery either. For mile after mile, there are only valleys of dust with mountains around them. The shine in a black sky. If you step out of the shadows of the mountain, it will mean moving from se great heat. These extreme temperatures break rocks away from the surface of the mountains co moon is also very silent, for sound waves can only travel through air. But beyond the horizon, you sight.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) has confirmed, for the first time, water on the sunlit surface of the Moon. This discovery indicates that water may be distributed across the lunar surface, and not limited to cold, shadowed places.</p><p></p><p>SOFIA has detected water molecules (H2O) in Clavius Crater, one of the largest craters visible from Earth, located in the Moon’s southern hemisphere. Previous observations of the Moon’s surface detected some form of hydrogen, but were unable to distinguish between water and its close chemical relative, hydroxyl (OH). Data from this location reveal water in concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million – roughly equivalent to a 12-ounce bottle of water – trapped in a cubic meter of soil spread across the lunar surface. The results are published in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy.</p><p></p><p>“We had indications that H2O – the familiar water we know – might be present on the sunlit side of the Moon,” said Paul Hertz, director of the Astrophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Now we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.”</p><p></p><p>As a comparison, the Sahara desert has 100 times the amount of water than what SOFIA detected in the lunar soil. Despite the small amounts, the discovery raises new questions about how water is created and how it persists on the harsh, airless lunar surface.</p><p></p><p>Water is a precious resource in deep space and a key ingredient of life as we know it. Whether the water SOFIA found is easily accessible for use as a resource remains to be determined. Under NASA’s Artemis program, the agency is eager to learn all it can about the presence of water on the Moon in advance of sending the first woman and next man to the lunar surface in 2024 and establishing a sustainable human presence there by the end of the decade.</p><p></p><p>SOFIA’s results build on years of previous research examining the presence of water on the Moon. When the Apollo astronauts first returned from the Moon in 1969, it was thought to be completely dry. Orbital and impactor missions over the past 20 years, such as NASA’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, confirmed ice in permanently shadowed craters around the Moon’s poles. Meanwhile, several spacecraft – including the Cassini mission and Deep Impact comet mission, as well as the Indian Space Research Organization’s Chandrayaan-1 mission – and NASA’s ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility, looked broadly across the lunar surface and found evidence of hydration in sunnier regions. Yet those missions were unable to definitively distinguish the form in which it was present – either H2O or OH.</p><p></p><p>“Prior to the SOFIA observations, we knew there was some kind of hydration,” said Casey Honniball, the lead author who published the results from her graduate thesis work at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa in Honolulu. “But we didn’t know how much, if any, was actually water molecules – like we drink every day – or something more like drain cleaner.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Its Quite Long But I Think This Is The Answer</p><br />

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</h2><br />
