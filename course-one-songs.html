The husband brought a drum-like musical instrument, similar to that of a can of a milk. Thewife sang a strange melodic song using a badjao dialect while the husband played his musical instrument. The wife wasindeed a good singer. The other passengers distanced themselves from the badjao couple. You, on the other hand, focusedyourself on the song and how the couple enjoved the song. After their song, the wife stretched out her right hand withher palm wide opened. Of course, she asked money from the passengers. However, no one cared to give the couple evena peso coin1.

                                                                                              THE OLYMPIAN GAMEGreece was made up of many separate States, each independent of the other. But there were several bonds which united the States. They spoke the same language, they worshipped the same gods, they kept the same great festivals.The festivals, held by a council called the Amphictyonic Council, were honoured by all the States. The council was made up of men chosen from twelve of the most ancient Greek tribes and met twice each year.The temple of Apollo at Delphi was under the care of the Amphictyonic Council, and it was at Delphi that the spring-tide festival was held. Another great festival of the Amphictyonic Council was celebrated in the temple dedicated to Demeter at Thermopylae.The Amphictyons, as the members of the council were called, did not govern Greece as a parliament governs a country. But they often talked of what could be done for the good of the States, and of how their interests could be united more closely.Of more power to weld the States together than the council, were the national games, where members of all the different countries of Greece met togetherThe chief of these games was the Olympian Games, which were believed to have begun far back in the shadowy past, and to have been revived by Lycurgus the lawgiver in 776 B.C.Olympia, where the games were held, was in the country of Elis in Peloponnesus. The King of Elis helped Lycurgus to renew the interest of the Greeks in the ancient games.It is said that when Apollo first saw the beautiful valley of Olympia he exclaimed, 'Here will I make me a fair temple to be an oracle for men.'The ancient Stadium, or race-course, was erected in the valley, as well as a temple to Zeus, in which the victors of the games were given wreaths of wild olive. These wreaths were valued more than any other prize or distinction in Greece. Indeed at Olympia no other reward was given save the simple wild olive branches, which were plucked from the sacred grove in the Olympian plain, and twined into a wreath.But when the victor returned to his own country, he was loaded with gifts and honours, for he had gained for his State and for his relations a glory which all longed to possess.In the Olympian temple, in later days, there was a marvellous statue of Zeus in gold and ivory, wrought by the genius of Pheidias, the greatest sculptor of Greece.The games were open to all, and spectators as well as competitors flocked to Olympia from every state in Greece. To the Greeks these games were part of their religion; they were rites pleasing, so they believed, to the gods.Should there be war between any of the Greek States at the time of the games, all hostile acts were forbidden in Olympia. Until the festival was over, those who had been in arms, one against another, might meet in safety and in peace. Twice or thrice an armed force made its way into the sacred territory of Elis to interfere with the games. This to the Greeks was sacrilege.In the earliest times the games lasted only for one day, and a simple foot-race was the only event. But soon the festival came to last five days, for there were now, not only foot-races, but wrestling, boxing, racing in armour, and above all else chariot races. In these races it was not the driver who, if successful, won the wreath of olive, but the owner of the chariot.On the first day of the games, sacrifices were offered to the gods, on the following three days the races were held, while on the last day people marched in procession to the temple and again offered sacrifices and feasted.At the end of every four years the games were celebrated; the time between the games being called an Olympiad. The year 776 B.C. was counted as the first Olympiad, the second began in 772 B.C. In ancient times the Greeks reckoned their dates by the Olympiads, thus an event was said to take place in a certain year of a certain Olympiad.Games were held at many other places as well as at Olympia, but the three most important celebrations, after the Olympian, were the Isthmian, the Pythian and the Nemean.To these festivals came the poets of Greece, prepared to celebrate in song the skill of the victors. During the intervals between the games, great numbers of the people assembled in a hall to listen to the poets while they recited their poems.As the years passed the great Greek dramas or plays came to be acted also at these festivals. At first the stage was a simple wooden platform in the open air, but soon wooden buildings were erected. Plays were performed at Athens in a splendid theatre which was hewn out of the solid rock of the Acropolis or citadel of the city. Tier after tier was cut, until the theatre could hold thirty thousand spectators.||Question||How were the Victors of the games given honor? What does this imply about the Greeks? ​</a>

                                            THE OLYMPIAN GAMEGreece was made up of many separate States, each independent of the other. But there were several bonds which united the States. They spoke the same language, they worshipped the same gods, they kept the same great festivals.The festivals, held by a council called the Amphictyonic Council, were honoured by all the States. The council was made up of men chosen from twelve of the most ancient Greek tribes and met twice each year.The temple of Apollo at Delphi was under the care of the Amphictyonic Council, and it was at Delphi that the spring-tide festival was held. Another great festival of the Amphictyonic Council was celebrated in the temple dedicated to Demeter at Thermopylae.The Amphictyons, as the members of the council were called, did not govern Greece as a parliament governs a country. But they often talked of what could be done for the good of the States, and of how their interests could be united more closely.Of more power to weld the States together than the council, were the national games, where members of all the different countries of Greece met togetherThe chief of these games was the Olympian Games, which were believed to have begun far back in the shadowy past, and to have been revived by Lycurgus the lawgiver in 776 B.C.Olympia, where the games were held, was in the country of Elis in Peloponnesus. The King of Elis helped Lycurgus to renew the interest of the Greeks in the ancient games.It is said that when Apollo first saw the beautiful valley of Olympia he exclaimed, 'Here will I make me a fair temple to be an oracle for men.'The ancient Stadium, or race-course, was erected in the valley, as well as a temple to Zeus, in which the victors of the games were given wreaths of wild olive. These wreaths were valued more than any other prize or distinction in Greece. Indeed at Olympia no other reward was given save the simple wild olive branches, which were plucked from the sacred grove in the Olympian plain, and twined into a wreath.But when the victor returned to his own country, he was loaded with gifts and honours, for he had gained for his State and for his relations a glory which all longed to possess.In the Olympian temple, in later days, there was a marvellous statue of Zeus in gold and ivory, wrought by the genius of Pheidias, the greatest sculptor of Greece.The games were open to all, and spectators as well as competitors flocked to Olympia from every state in Greece. To the Greeks these games were part of their religion; they were rites pleasing, so they believed, to the gods.Should there be war between any of the Greek States at the time of the games, all hostile acts were forbidden in Olympia. Until the festival was over, those who had been in arms, one against another, might meet in safety and in peace. Twice or thrice an armed force made its way into the sacred territory of Elis to interfere with the games. This to the Greeks was sacrilege.In the earliest times the games lasted only for one day, and a simple foot-race was the only event. But soon the festival came to last five days, for there were now, not only foot-races, but wrestling, boxing, racing in armour, and above all else chariot races. In these races it was not the driver who, if successful, won the wreath of olive, but the owner of the chariot.On the first day of the games, sacrifices were offered to the gods, on the following three days the races were held, while on the last day people marched in procession to the temple and again offered sacrifices and feasted.At the end of every four years the games were celebrated; the time between the games being called an Olympiad. The year 776 B.C. was counted as the first Olympiad, the second began in 772 B.C. In ancient times the Greeks reckoned their dates by the Olympiads, thus an event was said to take place in a certain year of a certain Olympiad.Games were held at many other places as well as at Olympia, but the three most important celebrations, after the Olympian, were the Isthmian, the Pythian and the Nemean.To these festivals came the poets of Greece, prepared to celebrate in song the skill of the victors. During the intervals between the games, great numbers of the people assembled in a hall to listen to the poets while they recited their poems.As the years passed the great Greek dramas or plays came to be acted also at these festivals. At first the stage was a simple wooden platform in the open air, but soon wooden buildings were erected. Plays were performed at Athens in a splendid theatre which was hewn out of the solid rock of the Acropolis or citadel of the city. Tier after tier was cut, until the theatre could hold thirty thousand spectators.||Question||How were the Victors of the games given honor? What does this imply about the Greeks? ​ ​</a>

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano?

                                            The story of Orpheus andEurydice(by Apollonius of Rhodes,Virgil and Ovid)Orpheus was the son of oneof the Muse Calliope andthe god Apollo. His mothergave him the gift of musicand Thrace where he grewupfosteredit.TheThracians were the most musical of the peoples of Greece. But Orpheus had norival there or anywhere except the gods alone. There was no limit to his powerwhen he played and sang. No one and nothing could resist him. Everythinganimate and inanimate followed him. He moved the rocks on the hillside andturned the courses of the rivers..When he first met and how he wooed the maiden he loved, Eurydice, we are nottold, but it is clear that no maiden he wanted could have resisted the power ofhis song. They were married, but their joy was brief. Directly after the wedding,as the bride walked in a meadow with her bridesmaids, a viper stung her andshe died. Orpheus' grief was overwhelming. He could not endure it. Hedetermined to go down to the world of death and try to bring Eurydice back. Hesaid to himself, “ With my song , I will charm Demeter's daughter, I will charmthe Lord of the Dead, moving their hearts with my melody. I will bear her awayfrom Hades.”He dared more than any other man ever dared for his love. He took thefearsome journey to the underworld. There he struck his lyre, and at the soundall that vast multitude were charmed to stillness. Listening to the melody of hislyre, tears flowed down at the cheeks of Hades. And so with Proserpine, whowas deeply moved.They summoned Eurydice and gave her to him, but upon one condition: that hewould not look back at her as she followed him, until they had reached theupper world. So the two passed through the great doors of Hades to the pathwhich would take them out of the darkness, climbing up and up. He knew thatshe must be just behind him, but he longed unutterably to give one glance tomake sure. But now they were almost there, the blackness was turning gray;now he had stepped out joyfully into the daylight. Then he turned to her. It wastoo soon; she was still in the cavern. He saw her in the dim light, and he heldout his arms to clasp her; but on the instant she was gone. She had slippedback into the darkness. All he heard was one faint word, "Farewell."Desperately he tried to rush after her and follow her down, but he was notallowed. The gods would not consent to his entering the world of the dead asecond time, while he was still alive. He was forced to return to the earth alone,in utter desolation. Then he forsook the company of men. He wandered throughthe wild solitudes of Thrace, comfortless except for his lyre, playing, alwaysplaying, and the rocks and the rivers and the trees heard him gladly, his onlycompanions.TASK 4: Organize your thoughtsFollowing the instructions below, fill in the graphic organizer with details from thestory, Orpheus and Eurydice.1.

                                            . • IMPRESSIONISM As the world entered the 20 century, a new era in music was introduced and impressionism was one of the carliest musical forms that paved way to this modern era. Impressionism is a French movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. The sentimental melodies and dramatic emotionalism of the preceding Romantic Period whose themes and melody are easy to recognize and enjoy, were being replaced in favor of moode and impressions. Features of Impressionism music are as follows: The use of "color", or in musical terms, timbre, which can be achieved through orchestration, harmonic usage, texture, etc. (Timbre is known as the tone color or tone quality) New combinations of extended chords, harmonies, whole tone, chromatic scales, and pentatonic scales emerged. Impressionism was an attempt not to depict reality, but merely to suggest it. CLAUDE DEBUSSY (1862-1918) Claude Debussy was one of the most influential and leading composers of the 20h century. He was the principal exponent of the impressionist movement and the inspiration for other impressionist composers. He reformed the course of musical development by eradicating traditional rules and conventions into a new language of possibilities in harmony. rhythm, form, texture, and color He was born on August 22, 1862 in a small town called St. Germain-en-Layein in France. min Sunus, et al. 2015 He composed a total of more or less 227 masterpieces which include orchestral music, chamber music, piano music, operas, ballets, songs, and other vocal music. He was known as the "Father of the Modern School of Composition" and made his impact in the styles of the later 20th century composer like Igor Stravinsky. Debussy's mature creative period was exemplified by the following works: Image from melhorendam String Quartet • La Mer (1905)-a highly imaginative and atmospheric symphonic work for orchestra about the sea .

this course.
C. Content:
Instruction: Be creative in the presentation of your experiences, reflections, and realizations. Being creative refers to
the use of a digital or hand-drawn artwork or a poem or a song, and the like. You are therefore expected to place/attach four (4) creative outputs each assigned to capture the four (4) modules of this course. Place a brief discussion about
the meaning of each creative output.

Dear Diary,
Dec 21, 2018 was our Christmas party in school before our Christmas break. Of course I enjoyed our party but I was even more exited to get home. At my house we were celebrating another Christmas party with our neighbors. The children of our neighbors and my sister performed together. Our band also sang Christmas songs along with my cousin who had a surprise performance. He played some Christmas songs on the violin and one of my neighbors who had a really nice voice couldn’t resist singing along with the violin. One of our neighbors even brought 4 cakes. After that, some of them went home with their parents, so the rest stayed and played Uno. It was a fun party until we had to clean up the place.</a>

                            6.                                                   THE OLYMPIAN GAMEGreece was made up of many separate States, each independent of the other. But there were several bonds which united the States. They spoke the same language, they worshipped the same gods, they kept the same great festivals.The festivals, held by a council called the Amphictyonic Council, were honoured by all the States. The council was made up of men chosen from twelve of the most ancient Greek tribes and met twice each year.The temple of Apollo at Delphi was under the care of the Amphictyonic Council, and it was at Delphi that the spring-tide festival was held. Another great festival of the Amphictyonic Council was celebrated in the temple dedicated to Demeter at Thermopylae.The Amphictyons, as the members of the council were called, did not govern Greece as a parliament governs a country. But they often talked of what could be done for the good of the States, and of how their interests could be united more closely.Of more power to weld the States together than the council, were the national games, where members of all the different countries of Greece met togetherThe chief of these games was the Olympian Games, which were believed to have begun far back in the shadowy past, and to have been revived by Lycurgus the lawgiver in 776 B.C.Olympia, where the games were held, was in the country of Elis in Peloponnesus. The King of Elis helped Lycurgus to renew the interest of the Greeks in the ancient games.It is said that when Apollo first saw the beautiful valley of Olympia he exclaimed, 'Here will I make me a fair temple to be an oracle for men.'The ancient Stadium, or race-course, was erected in the valley, as well as a temple to Zeus, in which the victors of the games were given wreaths of wild olive. These wreaths were valued more than any other prize or distinction in Greece. Indeed at Olympia no other reward was given save the simple wild olive branches, which were plucked from the sacred grove in the Olympian plain, and twined into a wreath.But when the victor returned to his own country, he was loaded with gifts and honours, for he had gained for his State and for his relations a glory which all longed to possess.In the Olympian temple, in later days, there was a marvellous statue of Zeus in gold and ivory, wrought by the genius of Pheidias, the greatest sculptor of Greece.The games were open to all, and spectators as well as competitors flocked to Olympia from every state in Greece. To the Greeks these games were part of their religion; they were rites pleasing, so they believed, to the gods.Should there be war between any of the Greek States at the time of the games, all hostile acts were forbidden in Olympia. Until the festival was over, those who had been in arms, one against another, might meet in safety and in peace. Twice or thrice an armed force made its way into the sacred territory of Elis to interfere with the games. This to the Greeks was sacrilege.In the earliest times the games lasted only for one day, and a simple foot-race was the only event. But soon the festival came to last five days, for there were now, not only foot-races, but wrestling, boxing, racing in armour, and above all else chariot races. In these races it was not the driver who, if successful, won the wreath of olive, but the owner of the chariot.On the first day of the games, sacrifices were offered to the gods, on the following three days the races were held, while on the last day people marched in procession to the temple and again offered sacrifices and feasted.At the end of every four years the games were celebrated; the time between the games being called an Olympiad. The year 776 B.C. was counted as the first Olympiad, the second began in 772 B.C. In ancient times the Greeks reckoned their dates by the Olympiads, thus an event was said to take place in a certain year of a certain Olympiad.Games were held at many other places as well as at Olympia, but the three most important celebrations, after the Olympian, were the Isthmian, the Pythian and the Nemean.To these festivals came the poets of Greece, prepared to celebrate in song the skill of the victors. During the intervals between the games, great numbers of the people assembled in a hall to listen to the poets while they recited their poems.As the years passed the great Greek dramas or plays came to be acted also at these festivals. At first the stage was a simple wooden platform in the open air, but soon wooden buildings were erected. Plays were performed at Athens in a splendid theatre which was hewn out of the solid rock of the Acropolis or citadel of the city. Tier after tier was cut, until the theatre could hold thirty thousand spectators.||Question||How were the Victors of the games given honor? What does this imply about the Greeks? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The honors and prizes that Olympic victors received reflected the philosophy of amateurism central to the Games.

                            12. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea.

Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano?

                            16. The story of Orpheus andEurydice(by Apollonius of Rhodes,Virgil and Ovid)Orpheus was the son of oneof the Muse Calliope andthe god Apollo. His mothergave him the gift of musicand Thrace where he grewupfosteredit.TheThracians were the most musical of the peoples of Greece. But Orpheus had norival there or anywhere except the gods alone. There was no limit to his powerwhen he played and sang. No one and nothing could resist him. Everythinganimate and inanimate followed him. He moved the rocks on the hillside andturned the courses of the rivers..When he first met and how he wooed the maiden he loved, Eurydice, we are nottold, but it is clear that no maiden he wanted could have resisted the power ofhis song. They were married, but their joy was brief. Directly after the wedding,as the bride walked in a meadow with her bridesmaids, a viper stung her andshe died. Orpheus' grief was overwhelming. He could not endure it. Hedetermined to go down to the world of death and try to bring Eurydice back. Hesaid to himself, “ With my song , I will charm Demeter's daughter, I will charmthe Lord of the Dead, moving their hearts with my melody. I will bear her awayfrom Hades.”He dared more than any other man ever dared for his love. He took thefearsome journey to the underworld. There he struck his lyre, and at the soundall that vast multitude were charmed to stillness. Listening to the melody of hislyre, tears flowed down at the cheeks of Hades. And so with Proserpine, whowas deeply moved.They summoned Eurydice and gave her to him, but upon one condition: that hewould not look back at her as she followed him, until they had reached theupper world. So the two passed through the great doors of Hades to the pathwhich would take them out of the darkness, climbing up and up. He knew thatshe must be just behind him, but he longed unutterably to give one glance tomake sure. But now they were almost there, the blackness was turning gray;now he had stepped out joyfully into the daylight. Then he turned to her. It wastoo soon; she was still in the cavern. He saw her in the dim light, and he heldout his arms to clasp her; but on the instant she was gone. She had slippedback into the darkness. All he heard was one faint word, "Farewell."Desperately he tried to rush after her and follow her down, but he was notallowed. The gods would not consent to his entering the world of the dead asecond time, while he was still alive. He was forced to return to the earth alone,in utter desolation. Then he forsook the company of men. He wandered throughthe wild solitudes of Thrace, comfortless except for his lyre, playing, alwaysplaying, and the rocks and the rivers and the trees heard him gladly, his onlycompanions.TASK 4: Organize your thoughtsFollowing the instructions below, fill in the graphic organizer with details from thestory, Orpheus and Eurydice.1.

                            17. . • IMPRESSIONISM As the world entered the 20 century, a new era in music was introduced and impressionism was one of the carliest musical forms that paved way to this modern era. Impressionism is a French movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. The sentimental melodies and dramatic emotionalism of the preceding Romantic Period whose themes and melody are easy to recognize and enjoy, were being replaced in favor of moode and impressions. Features of Impressionism music are as follows: The use of "color", or in musical terms, timbre, which can be achieved through orchestration, harmonic usage, texture, etc. (Timbre is known as the tone color or tone quality) New combinations of extended chords, harmonies, whole tone, chromatic scales, and pentatonic scales emerged. Impressionism was an attempt not to depict reality, but merely to suggest it. CLAUDE DEBUSSY (1862-1918) Claude Debussy was one of the most influential and leading composers of the 20h century. He was the principal exponent of the impressionist movement and the inspiration for other impressionist composers. He reformed the course of musical development by eradicating traditional rules and conventions into a new language of possibilities in harmony. rhythm, form, texture, and color He was born on August 22, 1862 in a small town called St. Germain-en-Layein in France. min Sunus, et al. 2015 He composed a total of more or less 227 masterpieces which include orchestral music, chamber music, piano music, operas, ballets, songs, and other vocal music. He was known as the "Father of the Modern School of Composition" and made his impact in the styles of the later 20th century composer like Igor Stravinsky. Debussy's mature creative period was exemplified by the following works: Image from melhorendam String Quartet • La Mer (1905)-a highly imaginative and atmospheric symphonic work for orchestra about the sea .

Dear Diary,
Dec 21, 2018 was our Christmas party in school before our Christmas break. Of course I enjoyed our party but I was even more exited to get home. At my house we were celebrating another Christmas party with our neighbors. The children of our neighbors and my sister performed together. Our band also sang Christmas songs along with my cousin who had a surprise performance. He played some Christmas songs on the violin and one of my neighbors who had a really nice voice couldn’t resist singing along with the violin. One of our neighbors even brought 4 cakes. After that, some of them went home with their parents, so the rest stayed and played Uno. It was a fun party until we had to clean up the place.</h2><br />
                        <p>Mahal na Diary,
</p><p>Disyembre 21, 2018 ay ang aming Christmas party sa paaralan bago ang aming Christmas break. Siyempre masaya ako sa aming partido ngunit mas lalo akong sumaya upang makauwi. Sa aking bahay ay nagdiriwang kami ng isa pang Christmas party sa aming mga kapitbahay. Ang mga anak ng aming mga kapitbahay at ang aking kapatid ay magkasamang nagtulungan. Ang aming banda ay umawit din ng mga kanta sa Pasko kasama ang aking pinsan na may isang pagganap ng sorpresa. Naglaro siya ng ilang mga kanta ng Pasko sa byolin at isa sa aking mga kapitbahay na may isang magandang galak na tinig ay hindi maaaring labanan ang pag-awit kasama ang byolin. Ang isa sa aming mga kapitbahay ay nagdala pa ng 4 na cake. Pagkatapos nito, ang ilan sa kanila ay umuwi na kasama ng kanilang mga magulang, kaya ang natitira ay nanatili at nag-play Uno. Ito ay isang masaya na partido hangga't kailangan naming linisin ang lugar. </p><br />
