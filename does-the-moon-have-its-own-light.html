If you could view the Moon from the Sun, would it appear to have phases? Explain your answer. The Moon revolves around the Earth, and Earth revolves around the Sun. When you look at the Moon, it appears to change shape. The shape of the Moon we see in the night sky is the phases of the Moon. The Moon does not actually change its shape. What changes is the amount of the Moon's lit side that we can see. The Moon does not give off its own light. It reflects the light of the Sun. Half of the Moon always faces the Sun and it is lit by its rays. The other half of the Moon is always dark.PAHELP NOW!!​</a>

If you could view the Moon from the Sun, would it appear to have phases? Explain your answer. The Moon revolves around the Earth, and Earth revolves around the Sun. When you look at the Moon, it appears to change shape. The shape of the Moon we see in the night sky is the phases of the Moon. The Moon does not actually change its shape. What changes is the amount of the Moon's lit side that we can see. The Moon does not give off its own light. It reflects the light of the Sun. Half of the Moon always faces the Sun and it is lit by its rays. The other half of the Moon is always dark.PAHELP NOW!!​</h2><br />
