                                            IntroductionLithosphere consists of crust and the upper portion of the mantle. There are two types of crust,the continental crust and the oceanic crust. The continental crust is thicker but less dense than theoceanic crust. Because of the difference in density, continental crust floats higher than the oceanic crust.The Earth is divided into segments called plates.There are seven relatively large plates and a number of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate.The plates move very slowly but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory ofmoving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics. Earthquake is a vibration of the Earth due to therapid release of energy and it is the consequences of moving crustal plates which is crucial in studyingplate tectonics.Learning Competency1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with their environment. It relates to the concept of socialization because socialization involves the process of learning social norms and values, which are shaped by the environment in which a person grows up. The environment in which a person is socialized can have a significant impact on their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.</p><p></p><p>2. Socialization refers to the process by which individuals learn the norms and values of their culture. It relates to development and adaptation because socialization helps individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to function effectively in their social and cultural environment. Through socialization, individuals learn how to communicate, interact with others, and navigate social hierarchies.</p><p></p><p>3. The key assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory are that development is shaped by the complex interplay between an individual's biology, environment, and cultural context, and that development occurs within multiple nested levels of influence. These levels include the microsystem (immediate environment), mesosystem (connections between microsystems), exosystem (indirect influences), and macrosystem (cultural context).</p><p></p><p>4. There are many different ecological contexts of development, including family, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, and broader cultural contexts. These contexts are interrelated in that they influence each other and are influenced by broader cultural factors. For example, a child's experiences in their family may influence their experiences in school, and both of these contexts may be influenced by broader cultural norms and values.</p><p></p><p>5. The ecological theory is useful in understanding the role of the teacher and the community in the learning of children in schools because it emphasizes the importance of multiple levels of influence on development. Teachers and communities are part of the mesosystem and exosystem, respectively, and can have a significant impact on children's development and learning. By understanding the complex interplay between different levels of influence, educators can better support the development and learning of children in schools.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            24. IntroductionLithosphere consists of crust and the upper portion of the mantle. There are two types of crust,the continental crust and the oceanic crust. The continental crust is thicker but less dense than theoceanic crust. Because of the difference in density, continental crust floats higher than the oceanic crust.The Earth is divided into segments called plates.There are seven relatively large plates and a number of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate.The plates move very slowly but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory ofmoving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics. Earthquake is a vibration of the Earth due to therapid release of energy and it is the consequences of moving crustal plates which is crucial in studyingplate tectonics.Learning Competency1.

                        <p></p>Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. These two concepts are related because socialization occurs within an ecological context, which influences the development and behavior of individuals.Socialization is the process by which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that are necessary to function effectively in society. It is closely related to development and adaptation because socialization plays a key role in shaping an individual's personality, beliefs, and behaviors, which in turn affect their ability to adapt to different social contexts.The key assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory are that human development is shaped by the interaction between the individual and the environment, and that this interaction occurs at multiple levels, including the microsystem (immediate environment), mesosystem (interactions between different microsystems), exosystem (external environment), and macrosystem (cultural context).The process of socialization in an ecological context involves the interaction between the individual and their immediate environment (microsystem), which includes family, peers, and other social groups. These interactions shape the individual's beliefs, values, and behaviors, and can have a significant impact on their development and adaptation.The ecological theory is useful in understanding the role of the teacher and the community in the learning of children in schools because it recognizes that development occurs within a broader ecological context. Teachers and community members play a critical role in shaping the microsystems in which children are socialized, and can have a significant impact on their academic achievement and social-emotional development. By understanding the ecological factors that influence learning, educators can design more effective interventions and support systems for children.<br />
