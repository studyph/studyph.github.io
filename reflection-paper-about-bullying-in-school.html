                        <br />     In school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.<br /><br />    There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something. <br /><br />    How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly,  love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love. <br />

                        <p>There are many causes of bullying in our society. Many school kids who bully others often do so in order to show their dominance to others and to raise their social status.  They may have a high self-esteem and they may show little regret or sorrow for their bullying behaviour, as they do not see bullying as a wrong act. Others may bully out of frustration and anger as they may socially struggle or they could have been a victim of bullying themselves and feel that bullying others helps them regain themselves as a person.</p><p>Bullying can affect everyone in different ways depending on the person them self, how they are being bullied and how they attempt to resolve what is happening.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quality as the amount of technology in the world increases, so does the number of students who are cyber bullied. Cyber bullying is often anonymous and occurs over the internet. Because there is usually no way to prove a person as being the abuser, cyber bullying has become extremely hard to fight. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the psychological effects cyber bullying has on high school aged teenagers.</p><p>This is due to the constant advancement of technology and the extensive possession of such technologic devices by youths. What makes cyber bullying an exceptionally disastrous event in the students life is that the bully can remain anonymous, can contact the victim at any time, and the victimizer makes the victim feel like he or she has no control over the situation. The power that the perpetrator seems to hold makes the victim feel that he or she is unable to defend their self. This lack of control can cause student to avoid school, avoid school functions, and to abstain from normal social activities. Sometime the bullying is so intense, cruel and unrelenting, that the student will revert to suicide as a means of escaping the …show more content…</p><p>Questions about self injury, cutting, burning, and bruising on purpose, were also asked.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is becoming a worldwide issue. It is more severe and much more serious than typical bullying. I say this because it is online, where, eventually, millions and billions of people can see it. With typical bullying, (that is physical), the hurt is done and it fades away. Cyberbullying can stay on the internet forever. Cyberbullying includes items of this sort: calling an individual inappropriate names, starting a hate blog, or hacking someone's personal account and posting personal and detailed information about that individual that can be true, and not true.</p><p></p><p>My thoughts on this issue is that is should go away. What I mean by this is that it should become illegal. No matter what your age, if you are accused and found guilty of cyberbullying (anything that is hurtful and mean and inappropriate) your internet account should be taken down immediately. I say this if the cyberbullying is really bad. If the cyberbullying is not so bad, I say that parents and legal guardians should step in and note the issue immediately. Overall, cyberbullying is very bad and the issue is becoming worldwide, and individuals should work hard to prevent it.</p><br />

Bullying has been a critical issue around schools, but before it was not as dangerous and know as it is now. These do not means bullying was not happening, it means it was not taken into consideration by parents or teachers. They thought it was just peer pressure or a kids game, and sooner or later the kids would be friends again. At one point, bullies think it’s normal to be mean and abusive to other students. They tell the victim, “I’m just messing with you” after aggression. On the other hand, the victim gives power to the bully by not speaking up and being afraid. Bullying can be avoid if the victim speaks up and seeks help from a teacher, parent, the principal, or a friend.

For example; community service, anti-bullying workshops, and school activities. Also, parents should be required to be more involved with the student academics, social life, and be responsible for their child’s behavior. By being involved in their kid’s life, this will help the bully have a better understanding of the situation, and he or she will learn how dangerous and painful is being a bully. On the other hand,  involved parents should have a better understanding as of why the student is having this behavior and will know how to help their child or seek additional help. Students will be aware of how much damage a bully may cause to the victim, and many times a bully is a victim of another bully.

                        <p>As I reflect on the issue of bullying and racial discrimination, I am struck by the profound impact these behaviors can have on the lives of those who experience them. Whether it is the physical and emotional pain caused by bullying, or the deep-seated feelings of fear, anger, and isolation that can result from racial discrimination, the effects of these behaviors are far-reaching and long-lasting.</p><p></p><p>I am also struck by the fact that these behaviors are all too common in our society. Despite the progress we have made in recent years towards greater understanding and acceptance of diversity, there are still far too many instances of bullying and discrimination, particularly in our schools and other institutions.</p><p></p><p>As I consider the causes of these behaviors, I am reminded of the power of social norms and the influence of the media. All too often, these forces serve to reinforce negative attitudes and stereotypes, leading to a vicious cycle of discrimination and abuse.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, I believe that the only way to effectively address these issues is through education and awareness. By teaching our children about the importance of respect and understanding for others, and by fostering an environment in which these values are actively promoted and celebrated, we can work towards a future in which bullying and discrimination are no longer tolerated. So, we should all be conscious about this and try to make a difference.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying in School</p><p>             Bullying in the schools has negative effects on individual students and on the school climate as a whole. Bullying can cause long-term problems for both the victims of bullying and the bullies themselves. To explore the effects of bullying on adolescents, we will define bullying, identify the characteristics of bullies and victims, outline the extent and consequences of bullying, and present resources for further information and assistance.</p><p>             Bullying is any behavior that is initiated by one or more students against a victim or victims that causes physical or psychological intimidation. Bullying behaviors can be classified as either direct (such as teasing, threatening, hitting, or stealing) or indirect (such as rumor spreading or social isolation). Boys typically employed direct methods of bullying, while girls tend to use in direct methods. Either way, behaviors must occur repeatedly overtime to be classified as bullying.</p><p>             Characteristics of Bullies and Victims</p><p>             There are specific behaviors that bullies tend to exhibit. The bullies often need to feel powerful and in control. They may feel no remorse when they inflict injury and suffering on others. Bullies tend to defy authority and are likely to break school rules. They seem to have little anxiety and appear to possess high self-esteem. Students who come from homes characterized by physical punishment tend to be more likely to exhibit these types of behaviors.</p><p>             Victims also tend to exhibit specific characteristics. They are often anxious, insecure, cautious, and have low self-esteem. Victims tend to be socially isolated, and may lack social skills and friends. Because they tend to be weaker than their peers, either physically or socially, victims rarely retaliate against bullies. Students who have close ties with their parents/guardians or who have overprotective parents/guardians are more likely to be victimized by bullies. </p><br />

                        <p>Bullying is still here. It never died to begin with. Just like how our technology and means of communication have changed, so did bullying. It now takes it place in different forms and shapes - in different platforms.
</p><p>
</p><p>In general definition, as defined by Merriam Webster, bullying is the abuse and mistreatment of someone vulnerable by someone stronger, more powerful, etc. If we'll look at before context, bullying takes form in different acts: physical harm, verbal harm, emotional harm, psychological harm, and others. But to this date, bullying does not only take place in this form. Here comes cyberbullying.
</p><p>
</p><p>According to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), one in three young people (1:3) in 30 countries have been a victim of online bullying. While there's one in five (1:5) students who skipped school due to cyberbullying.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cyberbullying of course takes it platform, the internet. Which is why almost all of the survey shows 13-17 year-old children who experience cyberbullying because these is the age range of the ones who use the internet the most and most of the time have easy access to the internet. Like bullying, cyberbullying have physical and emotional effects on oneself in the long run. They create emotional and psychological scars - which are more difficult to heal than physical ones.
</p><p>
</p><p>Based from the report as well, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter are the commonly used platforms for cyberbullying. While there were shared opinions on who's held responsible to address this issue, we have the government (32%), young people (31%) and the internet companies (29%).
</p><p>
</p><p>But really, the one responsible for this is actually the person reading this right now. We need to do about something that needs to be done. And either you've been bullied or is a bully, you have the power to put this to an end.  </p><p>
</p><p>This will be like a domino effect. Influence the next stack after you to follow and when the majority of you does, everyone else' follow.

They assumed it was merely social pressure or a kid's game, and that the youngsters would be friends again sooner or later. Bullies used to believe it was acceptable to be cruel and unpleasant to other students. Following aggressiveness, they tell the victim, "I'm only joking with you."
