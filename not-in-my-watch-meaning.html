                        HEAL OUR LAND BY JAMIE RIVERA<p></p>Our land is in pain and in desperate need of divine healing. Appropriately, God's admonishment discusses the important truth that sin and evilness in with us national life have straightforward and devastating effects on our national and international health. We pray for the healing of our land, <strong>the forgiveness of our sins</strong>, reconciliation, repentance, acceptance, and the renewal of our lives. We will be cleansed and renewed from our mistakes if we pray and humble ourselves The lines of the song implies about <strong>people's retreat from being prideful and sinful</strong>. In turn that they will pray and be absolved of their sins. The singer is asking a condition that if people change, he or she will forgive them. The speaker or singer in the song is describing how the nation is turning for the worst because of people's wickedness. The singer implies that the land is becoming sick or broken due to people's sins. In real life, the word "land" represents <strong>specific social issues</strong>, concerns, and dispositions.During the COVID-19 crisis, at the height of it, <strong>people are resorting to the Lord to  help them</strong> heal or overcome the ongoing health crisis. I believe the meaning of this song now is that people should repent as their sins are causing the destruction of the land. By returning to the Lord, there is a chance to be saved physically and spiritually. <p></p><p><strong>Summary and Analysis of the song</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/24309023</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />
