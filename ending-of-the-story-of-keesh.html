                        <p>Keesh was a thirteen-year-old boy who lived at the North Pole a long time ago. His father died of sruggling with a bear in order to keep the people in the village from starving. After that, Keesh lived alone with his mother. One council Keesh complained about unfair treatment, but other people laughed at him. Therefore, he decided to hunt by himself. Later on, Keesh used his brain to kill many bears and divided them fairly. In the end, Keesh rose to power and became the leader of his people. Keesh is the major character of this story. He appears throughout the story. He is a round character, we can prove that from the beginning of the story and the ending. At the beginning he is a young boy who is innocence, but at the end of the story he becomes a brave man who is respected by the others. He is protagonist character. He has an important role and he is the central figure in the story.</p><p>The Story of Keesh is about a man who "exercised headcraft and not witchcraft, and rose from the meanest IGLOO to be head man of his village." London's story was published in 1907.</p><p>An illustration for the story The Story of Keesh by the author Jack London</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>KEESH lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his village through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the old men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their children's children down to the end of time. And the winter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the ice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may venture forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the poorest IGLOO in the village, rose to power and place over them all.</p><p></p><p>He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had seen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one another's faces. The father of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a time of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and after that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone to forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a boy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the IGLOOS.</p><br />

                        Keesh was a young brave man who made a history in his village. He was recognized as a great huntsman like his late father Bok.<br />He
 wanted to give honor to his father's memory as a man who risk his life 
to feed his fellow villagers.  Being inspired to his father's notable 
deed, he emboldened himself and proved that he can do great as his 
father. Even if he was ridiculed,scorned, and doubted, Keesh was 
encouraged to hunt alone. His courage and will to continue his father's 
deeds made him more determined to be successful in hunting.<br />He 
returned to his village with a freshly-killed bear on his shoulders. His
 feat swept away his mother's sadness.  For so many times,he always 
return home with freshly-hunted ice-bears.<br />We can say that Keesh was 
truly a dignified and a great huntsman because, despite of being accused
 with all sorts, he never backed down.  <br /><br />
