                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The age of technology truly changes the way how we live from the previous generations. Technology makes our lives easier and the way how we deal with things becomes more advanced. This is the reason why we are now called superhumans. We have a lot of power of capabilities to transform lives with the help of technology. Impossible things before can now be made because of our advancement in certain things. We can now do multiple tasks because some of the works can be operated by a computer.</p><p></p><p>The power of media is also present compared to the previous years. Before, it would take weeks and months to receive a response from your relative. Now, in just a matter of seconds, we can send instant messages and receive replies from the time they have seen it. The relay of information can just be found in one place unlike before that we need to write scripts and articles in a book. We preserve and develop the term superhumans and in the next era, more and more advancement will be brought into this world.</p><p></p><p>To know more about the advantages and disadvantages of a computer, please refer to this link: brainly.ph/question/18000970.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />
