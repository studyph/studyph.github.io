Do this in your notebook. Protocol Definition Scale/Category/Topology Each node is connected to every node in the network. A type of network category where there is no dedicated servers or hierarchy among computers A computer network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network instead of physical wires. It represents a set of public standards that specify how packets of information are exchanged between computers over one or more networks. All nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. A network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.​</p>

Protocol Definition Scale/Category/Topology Each node is connected to every node in the network. A type of network category where there is no dedicated servers or hierarchy among computers A computer network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network instead of physical wires. It represents a set of public standards that specify how packets of information are exchanged between computers over one or more networks. All nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. A network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.​</h2><br />
