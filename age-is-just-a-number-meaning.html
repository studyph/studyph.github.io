That means it is possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. 2.As with any vaccine, you may experience adverse effects after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. All senior citizens are prioritized in getting vaccines. 3.While vaccine supplies are limited, it is recommended that priority be given to health workers at high risk of exposure and older people, including those aged 65 or older. These groups are prioritized as recommended. by World Health Organization (WHO). 4.The vaccine has only been tested in children above 16 years of age. Therefore, at this time, WHO does not recommend vaccination of children below 16 years of age, even if they belong to a high-risk group. 5.People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.

                                            II. Select the sentence that best expresses the main idea Box.11. Kittens need special care. You have to feed kittens twice a day. They have a lot of energy. You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases.

Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes.

We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam.

Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</h2><br />

Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                            16. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />
