                                            .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</a>

In this excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment," which two sentences best summarize the passage?
His guests shivered again. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, Dr. Heidegger?
"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.
In truth they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. The delirium which it created had effervesced away. Yes! they were old again. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.
"Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it; no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!"
But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</a>

                            13. .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</h2><br />

His guests shivered again. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, Dr. Heidegger?
"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.
In truth they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. The delirium which it created had effervesced away. Yes! they were old again. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.
"Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well, I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it; no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!"
But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The two sentences that best summarize the passage from Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment" are:</strong></p><p>"Are we grown old again, so soon?" cried they, dolefully.</p><p>In truth they had.</p><p></p><p>These two sentences summarize the passage because they convey the main theme of the story, which is the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of aging. The first sentence expresses the surprise and disappointment of the characters as they realize that they have aged again so soon. This is a key moment in the story as it highlights the disappointment of the characters and their realization that the Water of Youth they had consumed had a temporary effect on their youthfulness.</p><p></p><p><strong>The second sentence confirms </strong>that the characters have indeed aged again, and it serves to reinforce the main theme of the story that youth is transient and that aging is inevitable.</p><p></p><p><strong>The following sentence</strong> "Yes, friends, ye are old again," said Dr. Heidegger, "and lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground.

                        <p>If the drink is cold, the solubility is decreased and therefore the excess gas is given off. This loss of gas gives less fizz.
