The problem is their cat will not use the kitty door. There are several common reasons why cats won't use kitty doors. First, they may not understand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second, many kitty doors are dark and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they can't be sure of what is on the other side of the door, so they won't take a risk. One last reason cats won't use kitty doors is because some cats don't like the feeling of pushing through and then having the door drag across their back.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why won’t cats use the litterbox? There are several reasons that we will tell you in this article. We will also give you solutions to help you solve your litter box problems.</p><p></p><p>Litter box avoidance and inappropriate elimination (urinating outside the litter box) are the most frequent and irritating disagreements humans have with their kitties.</p><p>Inappropriate urination and defecation may mean that the litter box facilities are sub-par, that there’s a medical problem or, in the case of marking behavior, that your cat is trying to signal something.</p><p></p><p>Cats use elimination of urine (and sometimes feces) for communication – a kind of pee-mail if you will. That can be a sign that something is wrong. In the latter situation, your kitty is not mean or spiteful. She’s got a problem and you’ll have to figure out what it is if you want it to go away.</p><p></p><p>Punishing your cat for inappropriate elimination will not solve the problem. It will only teach her to fear and avoid you and eliminate when you’re not around. In fact, it can actually make the problem worse, since inappropriate elimination is often caused by stress, and punishment will only add to her stress level.</p><p></p><br />
