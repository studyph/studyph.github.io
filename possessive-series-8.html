                            14. Pls help PoDetermine what theory of crime can be apply based on the given concept and/or give the name of the advocator of such concept.1. According to this theory, individuals were thought to be possessed by good or evil spirits, which caused good or evil result.2.This theory states the children and lunatics could not calculate pain and pleasure, therefore, must be exempted from criminal liability.3.Men are rational being who has the freewill to choose between good or evil.And a person always acts in such a way as to seek pleasure and avoid pain.4.Criminals are like sick people who required rehabilitation rather than the imposition of punishment.5.According to his person, crime is an important ingredient to all healthy societies.6. He claims the crime is a symbolic expression of one's inner tension which a person has but fails to control.7. This theory states that heredity is the primary determinant of one's behavior and body physique are a reliable indicator of one's personality.8. This theory claims that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction in the process of communication.9. He believe that the failure of man to achieved a higher status of life caused them to commit crime in order for that status or goal to be attained.10. He is the advocator on the theory that crimes against person increase during summer and crimes against property increases during winter.11. The theory which states that man is an organism having an animalistic behavior that is dependent on other animals for survival.Thus, man steals and kills to live.12. This theory claims that behavior becomes criminal if it is labeled as such.13. He maintains that an individual will obey or disobey societal rules depending upon his or her ability to rationalize whether he is protected from hurt or destruction.14. He claims that the lower class cannot socialized effectively as the middle class in what is considered appropriate middle class behavior.Thus, the lower class gathers together 20 there common values forming a subculture that rejects middle class values.15. This theory is a forms of control, which suggest that a series of both i internal and external factors contribute to criminal behavior.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Criminological theories attempt to explain what is often inexplicable and to examine what is often the cruelty, oppression, or even evil some visit on others. They are sci- entific examinations of a particular social phenomenon.</p><p>2.Lombroso's (1876) theory of criminology suggests that criminality is inherited and that someone "born criminal" could be identified by the way they look.</p><p>3.A man is rational in his actions if they are performed in accordance with some sensible reasons which make the aim he pursues possible of attainment.</p><p>4.Rehabilitation has different programs such as drug addict rehab program, violent behavior rehab program and so on. ... This brings us to the point that rehabilitation is a much better option than punishment because it would help an offender become a peaceful citizen and live a normal life.</p><p>5.Crime is normal because a society without crime would be impossible. Behaviors considered unacceptable have increased, as society progresses not decreases. If a society is operating as its normal healthy self the rate of deviance should change very little. ... Moral authority begins to breakdown and deviance rates change.</p><p>6.This idea first struck Cesare Lombroso, the so-called “father of criminology,” in the early 1870s.</p><p>7.Somatotyping is the classifying of people into types according to body build. Somatotype theory relates distinctive body types to personality characteristics and relates criminal behavior to the body types. ... Sheldon's somatotype theory established three basic body types: endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph.</p><br />
