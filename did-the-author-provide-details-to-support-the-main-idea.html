These very demanding environments cry out for mature behavior in everyone, youth as well as adults. It is when everyone accepts responsibility for truth, honesty, and a job-well-done that ntegrity, once again emerges as Pillar of our national pride. 1. What is the main idea expressed by the text?2.

                            11.                      CONCEPT Integrity, the word evokes the wonder of whether our society deserves its value. With constant whining about one's rights there exist the denial of personal responsibility and the accompanying lowering of personal worth. Where, then, are the individuals who will stand up to the demands of family unity, a strong work ethic, and a wholesome participation in the societal framework? These very demanding environments cry out for mature behavior in everyone, youth as well as adults. It is when everyone accepts responsibility for truth, honesty, and a job-well-done that ntegrity, once again emerges as Pillar of our national pride. 1. What is the main idea expressed by the text?2.
