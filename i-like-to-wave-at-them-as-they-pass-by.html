It provides an opportunity for the readers to change their opinions on a certain viewpoint. It expresses stories using plot and other literary elements. It lays down facts or processes to inform the readers. Task 5: Passing the Threshold Now that you already know the text types, you will practice recognizing them in this activity. First, write the text type of the selection. Then, write a one to two-sentence explanation of your answer. Write your responses on your answer sheet. 1. Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

When the sun had set, Paeng would remember that their mother would like them to bePaeng and Delia loved to play in the beach so much that they would often forget thehome before dark.One day, Delia saw some prints in the sand that led into the ocean."Paengl Come look at these. I wonder what animal made these prints," she criedm"I know, I saw the same kind of tracks two years ago. They're turtle tracks. A turtlecame to this beach and laid her eggs. Then I guess she went right back into the ocean," Paengreplied. "Let's follow the tracks and look for the nest."So they followed the tracks until they came upon the turtle's nesi."Where are the eggs?" asked Delia."The mother turtle must have covered them with sand to keep the eggs warm," repliedThey would have continued with their investigation but it was getting dark. Paeng didnot want their mother to worry. So Paeng and Delia raced each otherand headed for the lightPaeng.that shone on their porch.were so surprised at the sight that greeted them in the yard.Several weeks passed. One night after supper, Paeng and Delia went outside. They"Mamal Mamal" cried Paeng and Delia.Their mother quickly ran out to the porch to see what was happening.Paeng's light shone on dozens and dozens of tiny crawling sea turtles."Where did these sea turtles come from?" their mother asked.Delia remembered the turtle nest. “Mama, we saw a turtle nest several weeks back.Maybe these turtles came from the nest," she said."But why are they here? After they hatch, the sea turtles head towards the light. Onbeaches where people do not live, the brightest area would be the waves reflecting the light ofthe moon and the stars. So the turtles followed the house lights. We can help the turtles findtheir way to the sea if we turn off the lights at night as soon as we finish our chores.""It's a good thing we saw these sea turtles. If they continued crawling away from thesea, they would have been eaten by crabs and other animals.If they do not reach the sea, they would die from loss of water in their bodies. Comeon, let's guide the turtle to the sea," continued mother.Paeng got a lamp and to his delight the sea turtles followed the light of the lamp.When they reached the shore, Paeng waded to the sea and held the lamp.Before long, the small sea turtles scrambled into the water. They raced in the wavesto begin their life in the sea.(Lifted from Science and Mathematics stories, Vol. 1)3. Comprehension check upAnswer the following questions:a.

                                            The power to actThe brain has three major parts -- the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem. The brain stem connects the spinal cord and the brain. It controls functions that keep people alive such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and food digestion. Those activities occur without any thought. You aren't telling yourself, "Inhale. Exhale. Inhale." You're just breathing.Things are different in the cerebellum. That region controls voluntary movement. When you want to lift your fork, wave your hand, brush your hair or wink at a cutie, you form the thought and then an area in the cerebellum translates your will into action. It happens so quickly. Think about how little time passes between your desire to continue reading this sentence and the time it takes your eyes to move to this word or this one. It seems automatic, but it isn't.Neurons, the basic functional units of the nervous system, are three-part units and are key to brain function. They are comprised of a nerve cell body, axon and dendrite, and they power the rapid-fire process that turns thought into movement.The thought moves as an electrical signal from the nerve cell down the axon to a dendrite, which looks like branches at the end of nerve cells. The signal jumps from the end of the dendrite on one cell across the space, called a synapse, to the dendrite of another cell with the help of chemicals called neurotransmitters. That signal continues jumping from cell to cell until it reaches the muscle you need to wave, wink or walk.The cerebrum is the largest of the three brain sections, accounts for about 85 percent of the brain's weight, and has four lobes. The lobes-frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital - each have different functions. They get their names from the sections of the skull that are next to them.The parietal lobe helps people understand what they see and feel, while the frontal lobe determines personality and emotions. Vision functions are located in the occipital lobe, and hearing and word recognition abilities are in the temporal lobe.PA TULONG PO PAKI SUMMARIZE DAW PO PAGKATAPOS MA I SUMMARIZE MAY BIGAY NG TANONG WITH EXPLANATION ​</a>

                                            All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</a>

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />

I wonder what animal made these prints," she criedm"I know, I saw the same kind of tracks two years ago. They're turtle tracks. A turtlecame to this beach and laid her eggs. Then I guess she went right back into the ocean," Paengreplied. "Let's follow the tracks and look for the nest."So they followed the tracks until they came upon the turtle's nesi."Where are the eggs?" asked Delia."The mother turtle must have covered them with sand to keep the eggs warm," repliedThey would have continued with their investigation but it was getting dark. Paeng didnot want their mother to worry. So Paeng and Delia raced each otherand headed for the lightPaeng.that shone on their porch.were so surprised at the sight that greeted them in the yard.Several weeks passed. One night after supper, Paeng and Delia went outside. They"Mamal Mamal" cried Paeng and Delia.Their mother quickly ran out to the porch to see what was happening.Paeng's light shone on dozens and dozens of tiny crawling sea turtles."Where did these sea turtles come from?" their mother asked.Delia remembered the turtle nest. “Mama, we saw a turtle nest several weeks back.Maybe these turtles came from the nest," she said."But why are they here? After they hatch, the sea turtles head towards the light. Onbeaches where people do not live, the brightest area would be the waves reflecting the light ofthe moon and the stars. So the turtles followed the house lights. We can help the turtles findtheir way to the sea if we turn off the lights at night as soon as we finish our chores.""It's a good thing we saw these sea turtles. If they continued crawling away from thesea, they would have been eaten by crabs and other animals.If they do not reach the sea, they would die from loss of water in their bodies. Comeon, let's guide the turtle to the sea," continued mother.Paeng got a lamp and to his delight the sea turtles followed the light of the lamp.When they reached the shore, Paeng waded to the sea and held the lamp.Before long, the small sea turtles scrambled into the water. They raced in the wavesto begin their life in the sea.(Lifted from Science and Mathematics stories, Vol. 1)3. Comprehension check upAnswer the following questions:a.

                            4. The power to actThe brain has three major parts -- the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem. The brain stem connects the spinal cord and the brain. It controls functions that keep people alive such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and food digestion. Those activities occur without any thought. You aren't telling yourself, "Inhale. Exhale. Inhale." You're just breathing.Things are different in the cerebellum. That region controls voluntary movement. When you want to lift your fork, wave your hand, brush your hair or wink at a cutie, you form the thought and then an area in the cerebellum translates your will into action. It happens so quickly. Think about how little time passes between your desire to continue reading this sentence and the time it takes your eyes to move to this word or this one. It seems automatic, but it isn't.Neurons, the basic functional units of the nervous system, are three-part units and are key to brain function. They are comprised of a nerve cell body, axon and dendrite, and they power the rapid-fire process that turns thought into movement.The thought moves as an electrical signal from the nerve cell down the axon to a dendrite, which looks like branches at the end of nerve cells. The signal jumps from the end of the dendrite on one cell across the space, called a synapse, to the dendrite of another cell with the help of chemicals called neurotransmitters. That signal continues jumping from cell to cell until it reaches the muscle you need to wave, wink or walk.The cerebrum is the largest of the three brain sections, accounts for about 85 percent of the brain's weight, and has four lobes. The lobes-frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital - each have different functions. They get their names from the sections of the skull that are next to them.The parietal lobe helps people understand what they see and feel, while the frontal lobe determines personality and emotions. Vision functions are located in the occipital lobe, and hearing and word recognition abilities are in the temporal lobe.PA TULONG PO PAKI SUMMARIZE DAW PO PAGKATAPOS MA I SUMMARIZE MAY BIGAY NG TANONG WITH EXPLANATION ​</h2><br />

                            5. All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</h2><br />
