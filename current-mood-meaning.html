                                            II. Select the sentence that best expresses the main idea Box.11. Kittens need special care. You have to feed kittens twice a day. They have a lot of energy. You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</a>

                                             There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

You need to play with them oftenKittens will chew on almost anything they find. You have to watch them closely.12. Before clocks were made, people kept track of time by other means. In ancient Egypt, people used a water clock Water drippedslowly from one clay pot into another. People measured time according to how long it took one pot to empty and the other one tofill. Candle clocks were common during the Middle Ages. As such, when a candle burned, marks on its side showed about howmuch time had passed. A final ancient way to measure time was the sundial, which used the movement of the sun across the skyThe shadows moving across the face of the sundial showed the current time13. There are great numbers of deer around here. This whole area is great place for hunters and fishermen There are bears,mountain lions, and coyotes. To the east there are streams full of trout, and there are ducks and geese14. Advertising affects our lives every day. Brand names are common household words. We start each day using the toothpastesoap, and breakfast foods promoted by advertisers. Ads have made the cars we drive signs of our success Our choices of food,dress, and entertainment are swayed by ads.15. The physical environment of a classroom is extremely important. It can influence the way teachers and students feel, thmk, andbehave. If a student feels pressured, under stress, unhappy, or unsafe, it would be impossible for her or him to learn the lessonsplanned by the educator. Likewise, if a teacher feels unhappy or disorganized because of the classroom's lack of order or detail, theability for her to teach is greatly diminished.16. Apples can be used to make many delicious treats. Some people like to slice apples and dip them in caramel. Others like to cookthem and make them into apple jam. You might enjoy cutting apples and bake them into a pie or maybe you like to use freshlypicked apples to make fresh apple juice. Many people like to just pick apple and eat it right away.17. Chameleons change color for different reasons. They may change color to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature oflight. They may also change colors depending on certain moods such as fear or excitement.18. Some kinds of bats eat many insects. Some bats can eat up to 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Bats are helpful to the environmentWithout bats, we would have too many insects.19 Sloths are the slowest mammals on earth. It takes a full minute for a sloth to move 6 feet across the ground You probablycouldn't move that slowly if you tried! The sloth's body is about 2 feet long. It has long legs, and curved claws that are 3 to 4 incheslong. Their claws and their long legs help them climb trees and hang from tree branches. They spend almost their entire liveshanging from tree branches.20. Exercise is crucial to our lives. Doctors recommend we exercise at least two times a week. Exercise does not necessarily need tobe done in the gym; it can consist of an outdoor walk or bike ride. It not only controls weight, but it combats many health conditionsand diseases. Another added benefit to exercise is its mood boosting qualities.​</h2><br />

                            6.  There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.
