This study focused on the influence of media on the (2) body image satisfaction among (3) adolescents. The study aimed to determine which media (4) influence adolescents most, the level of body image satisfaction of the adolescents, the (5) relationship between media and body image satisfaction, and propose (6) measures to enhance the adolescents’ body image satisfaction.
