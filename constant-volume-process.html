1. When pressure of a gas in a container increases, the volume also increases
2. Inverse proportionality relationship happens when one quantity or variable decreases the other quantity or variable also decreases.
3. Boyle’s law states that, at constant temperature the volume of a given mass of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.
4. The breathing process involves the concept of Boyle’s law.

                            1. The reason why the volume is constant in an isochoric process and no work is done is because the volume change is zero, in this case, the work done is zero.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The work done by an ideal gas is defined as its pressure times its change in volume, or PΔV (or PdV). Because the volume change ΔV, is zero in an isochoric process, however, no work is done by the gas. Hence, the change in internal energy of the gas is simply equal to the amount of heat added.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>B.YUNG </strong><strong>ANSWER</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Experience has shown that several properties of a gas can be related to each other under certain conditions. The properties are pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T, in kelvins), and amount of material expressed in moles (n). What we find is that a sample of gas cannot have any random values for these properties. Instead, only certain values, dictated by some simple mathematical relationships, will occur.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the seventeenth and especially eighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest to make balloons in which they could fly (Figure 1), a number of scientists established the relationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the ideal gas law—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.
