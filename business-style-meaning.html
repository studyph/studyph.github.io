A new Pew Research Center survey finds profound differences between black and white adults in their views on racial discrimination, barriers to black progress and the prospects for change. Blacks, far more than whites, say black people are treated unfairly across different realms of life, from dealing with the police to applying for a loan or mortgage. And, for many blacks, racial equality remains an elusive goal.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming majority of blacks (88%) say the country needs to continue making changes for blacks to have equal rights with whites, but 43% are skeptical that such changes will ever occur.  An additional 42% of blacks believe that the country will eventually make the changes needed for blacks to have equal rights with whites, and just 8% say the country has already made the necessary changes.</p><p></p><p>A much lower share of whites (53%) say the country still has work to do for blacks to achieve equal rights with whites, and only 11% express doubt that these changes will come.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From the given dialogue, it can be inferred that the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of the familial relationship on language form is manifested in the use of informal language, such as the use of terms like “Ma” and “Papa”, as well as the use of the Tagalog term “anak”. The duration of interaction is lengthy, as the dialogue is composed of multiple exchanges between the speakers. The relationship of speaker-audience is interactive in nature, as both parties actively exchange ideas. The role and responsibilities of the speaker is to express their opinion and ideas, as well as to provide feedback to the other speakers. The message communicated is that the speaker is interested in pursuing business management at college, and the delivery is done in a respectful and humorous manner. When the speakers shifted in speech context, the tone shifted from a serious one to a more lighthearted one. The shift in speech style was from a formal one to an informal one. The shift in speech act was from a directive one to a humorous one. The shift in communicative strategy was from a confrontational one to a collaborative one.</p><br />

Identify the kind of relationship that the speakers and listeners have and explain the effect on language form, duration of interaction, the relationship of speaker-audience, role and responsibilities of the speaker, message, and delivery when the speakers shifted in speech context, speech style, speech act, and communicative strategy. You do not have to discuss all the effects. You may opt to discuss the effects on language form, message, and delivery for example. Use another sheet of paper for your answer and attach it to this activity sheet. A rubric is given to serve as your guide to achieving a very good score. You: Ma, I would like to pursue business management at my college. Papa: (enters the dining area and interrupts) Business management??? You: Of course! To earn a lot of money. For your new shoes (laughing)! Mama: (disagreeing) Get another course, NOT THAT. The tuition fee is TOO EXPENSIVE. You: No! That's what I want. Papa: Ok, but we do not enough have money for that course. You: (disrespectful tone) It's your responsibility, not mine. Mama: (raising voice) YOU SHOULD NOT TALK THAT WAY, WE ARE YOUR PARENTS! Have some respect, anak. You: Sorry po! I said that because I want to study. But, I can go to work so I can study. I will multiply myself to my work and school at that time. Mama and Papa: (laughing voice) What do you mean "multiply?" You made us laugh. You: Nothing. I said "Mahal ko po kayo."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>In this dialogue, the speakers have a familial relationship. The effect of this relationship on language form can be seen in the use of familiar terms and pronouns, such as "Ma," "Papa," and "anak," which are used to address family members in Filipino. This also affects the duration of interaction, as familial relationships tend to involve longer and more frequent interactions compared to other types of relationships.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the speaker and audience in this dialogue is that of parent and child, with the parents serving as the audience and the child speaking to them. This affects the role and responsibilities of the speaker, as the child is expected to show respect and obedience to their parents.</p><p></p><p>The message in this dialogue revolves around the child's desire to pursue a college degree in business management, and the parents' disagreement with this decision due to financial concerns. The delivery of this message is affected by the shift in speech context, as the conversation moves from a casual conversation to a more serious discussion about the child's education and future. This can also be seen in the shift in speech style, from a casual and joking tone to a more respectful and serious tone.</p><p></p><p>The shift in communicative strategy can also be seen in the child's use of the term "multiply" in response to their parents' questioning of their statement. This is likely an attempt by the child to defuse the tension and lighten the mood by making a joke.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the effects of the familial relationship on language form, duration of interaction, speaker-audience relationship, and delivery can be seen throughout the dialogue.</p><p></p><p>Pabrainliest :)</p><p></p><br />
