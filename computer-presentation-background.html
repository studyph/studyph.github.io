B. The scientist works with a few other scientists in a secret lab that is sponsored by a large business corporation. When the scientists have results, they contact others in the scientific community to report their results.
C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters. Now, to convert, we can just multiply 2.50 L x (1 quart / 0.943 L) = 2.65 quarts. Note how the "liters unit" is cancelled and we are left with quarts.</p><br /><p><strong>2.

</p><p>A. Computers are more useful for quick calculations.
</p><p>B. Computers are easier to transport to remote locations.
</p><p>C. Computers have lower power consumption.
</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3.

</p><p>A. Write a hypothesis to answer a question.
</p><p>B. Write a title at the top of a completed lab report.
</p><p>C. Record the time to complete a chemical reaction.
</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.

</p><p>C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?

</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>

</p><p>Options B and D talk more about the completeness of the information rather than the reliability. Option A is not true, since scientific information can be used by anyone as reference. Option C is true since having multiple sources confirm the same thing makes it more reliable than just a single source.
