Correct the statement if it is false.1.People engage in philosophy when they think about science and everything in it. 2.According to Aristotle, philosophy arises from the human ability to reflect, wonder, and be curious.3. Wonder is the sole cause of philosophizing.4. Philosophy means the love of wisdom5 Aristotle defined humans as rational beings.6. Without the human capacity to wonder and be curious, philosophical thinking would occur.7 Philosophy begins in wonder.8. "Philos" refers to the special kind of love found in close friendship.9. Sufficient leisure must be available to engage in reflection.10. Cultivating the art of philosophizing is important because such an art leads us along the path toward wisdom.271​</a>

Reflection</strong></p><p>Reflective learning is a way of allowing learners to step back from their learning experience, helping them to develop critical thinking skills and, improve on future performance by analysing what they have learned and how far they have come.</p><p><strong>2. D. Logic</strong></p><p>Logic is the study of correct reasoning or good arguments. It is often defined in a more narrow sense as the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. In this sense, it is equivalent to formal logic and constitutes a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral way.</p><p><strong>3. C. Primary Reflection</strong></p><p>Explanation: "Primary Reflection" is the type of philosophical reflection which trains the mind to think logically. It is also the ability of the mind to construct and evaluate arguments.</p><p><strong>4. B. Scorates</strong></p><p>The term "dialectic" was used by Socrates as "the art of discussion" by which he searched for truth through questioning and answering. He looked down upon the Sophist's form of argumentation known as "eristic" and was derived from dialectic. A Socratic dialectic method is a form of inquiry and debate between individuals with opposing viewpoints based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presumptions.</p><p><strong>5.
