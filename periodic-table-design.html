This convenient tool contains most of the information that students and even chemists themselves need, whether they are studying an element or doing experiments. However, the amount of information packed in the periodic table can easily intimidate anyone who is new to chemistry You are a chemist and your task is to create a user guide for the periodic table of elements. The guide should be simple but has enough information. The user guide can be in the form of a brochure, pamphlet, or a booklet.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>haha alam mo ba isà Kang myembro Ng kūpâl kids</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)Gold mixed with alloys are more durable than sterling silver. Pure gold doesn't tarnish. Both gold and silver are known as a noble metal. This means they don't tarnish easily, corrode, rust, or disintegrate in harsh conditions.<br /><br />2.)Why do some elements have letter symbols that are like their name and others do not?</p><p>Many of the elements have been know since ancient times. Back then the language of “science” (though it was more often alchemy) was Latin. So the symbols that we still use are based on contractions of the original Latin names. The symbols are assignned on the basis of the first letter of elements<br /><br />3.)The three major groups on the Periodic Table are the metals, nonmetals and metalloids. Elements within each group have similar physical and chemical properties.<br /><br />4.)Metals are hard and malleable, with the ability to change shape. Non metals are usually soft and brittle. A jeweler would rather work with a metal, because it won't break as soon as they try to shape it, or cut apart to easily and not hold its shape.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Pure substance are both <strong>elements </strong>and a <strong>compound.</strong> All elements you found in the periodic table are a form of matter and combination of one or more element in fixed proportion is known as compound. Elements are bonded chemically in a compound. <strong>Mixture</strong> is the combination of two or more substances which are not chemically bonded and it can be homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture. <strong>Homogeneous mixture</strong> is the combination of two or more substances which shows only one phase while <strong>heterogeneous mixture</strong> is the combination of two or more substances which shows more than one phase.</p><p></p><p><strong>Compound at Home:</strong></p><p>Table salt of (Sodium Chloride)</p>For me this is the most important compound at home since it provide flavor to the food that I eat at home.
