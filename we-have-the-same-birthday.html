To find the area of a trapezoid, you need to know the lengths of the two bases (the parallel sides) and the height (the distance between the bases). The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:</p><p></p><p>Area = (base1 + base2)/2 * height</p><p></p><p>In this case, the bases are 45m and 40m and the height is 25m. Plugging these values into the formula gives:</p><p></p><p>Area = (45 + 40)/2 * 25 = 85/2 * 25 = 42.5 * 25 = 1062.5</p><p></p><p>So the answer is 1062.5 m², or option a.</p><p></p><p>33. To find the volume of a cube, you can use the formula volume = edge length ^3. Using this formula, the volume of a cube with edges of length 5 cm is:</p><p></p><p>volume = 5 cm * 5 cm * 5 cm</p><p>= 5^3 cm^3</p><p>= 125 cm^3</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is b. 125cm.</p><p></p><p>34.

When we say that an event is unlikely to happen, the probability is generally low, but not necessarily zero. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 0-50%.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, and it is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or as a percentage between 0% and 100%). An event with a probability of 0 is impossible, and an event with a probability of 1 is certain to happen.
