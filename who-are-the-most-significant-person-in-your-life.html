WHAT DEMANDS AND CHALLENGES OF ADOLESCENCE DO YOU CONSIDER AS QUITE HARD FOR YOU TO DO?WHY? 3. WHO DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PERSON IN YOUR LIFE AT PRESENT? AND WHY?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Adolescence is a crucial period of development that presents many challenges and demands. It is a time when individuals are transitioning from childhood to adulthood, which can bring about physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Therefore, understanding and meeting the challenges and demands of adolescence is essential for healthy development and successful transition into adulthood. Some of these challenges include navigating changes in the body, developing a sense of identity, establishing healthy relationships, making decisions about education and career paths, and dealing with peer pressure and societal expectations.</p><p>2. I can say that some challenges that adolescents commonly face include managing emotions, coping with stress, establishing independence while still relying on caregivers, dealing with social media and technology use, and navigating romantic relationships. These challenges can be particularly difficult for adolescents who lack support from family and peers or who have experienced trauma or adverse experiences in their childhood.</p><p>3. The most significant person in one's life at present may vary depending on their individual circumstances and needs. It could be a parent, a friend, a mentor, a significant other, or someone else who provides support, guidance, and understanding. The importance of this person may also change over time as one's needs and circumstances evolve. Ultimately, having a significant person in one's life who provides  and social support can be crucial for navigating the challenges and demands of adolescence and beyond.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>can’t say “thank you” enough to express how grateful I am for you coming into my life. You have made such a huge impact on my life. I would not be the person I am today without you and I know that you will keep inspiring me to become an even better version of myself.</p><p></p><p>You have taught me that you don’t always have to strong. You are allowed to break down as long as you pick yourself back up and keep moving forward. I know that you don’t believe in things happening for a reason so I can believe for the both of us that you were brought into my life for a reason.</p><p></p><p>You have taught me that I have a story and that my story matters. More so, you have taught me that other people need my story. Through honesty and vulnerability, I can open doors that would otherwise stay closed. It wasn’t until I started to get honest and vulnerable with myself that I could get honest and vulnerable with other people.</p><p></p><p>You have taught me that despite my flaws and hurts, my story is still valid and that gave me the strength to validate other people’s stories</p><p></p><p>Because you taught me to see the world differently, I learned to treat the world differently.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope this helps you☺️</p><p></p><br />
