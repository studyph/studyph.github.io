                        <p>Coming to work during this COVID-19 pandemic is putting frontline workers under unprecedented and immense pressure that threatens their physical, mental and social health. Prolonged exposure to excessive stress can have many detrimental consequences for the emotional and mental health of frontline workers: it leads to burnout syndrome, it causes common psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leading to unhealthy behaviors.</p><p></p><p>In the context of COVID-19, this could mean reduced quality and safety of care, violations of protocols and guidelines, increased risk of infection, and reduced capacity of health systems and emergency response teams.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The decision to suspend the elections for barangay officials this year in the Philippines has been met with mixed reactions from the public. While some see it as a necessary step to ensure the safety of the people in light of the ongoing pandemic, others believe that the suspension of elections is a violation of the people’s right to choose their leaders. In this essay, I will discuss why the suspension of barangay elections is an appropriate course of action. </p><p></p><p>To begin with, the suspension of the elections provides a safeguard to protect the health and safety of the populace. This is especially important given the current public health situation. With the proliferation of the virus, it is essential for the government to take measures that will reduce the risk of transmission. Holding an election during this pandemic will put a heavy strain on the country’s limited medical resources, as well as increase the risk of infection to both the candidates and the voters. Thus, it is only logical to suspend the elections to protect the people from the virus. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, the suspension of elections also allows the government to focus its resources on more pressing matters. With the pandemic raging on, the government must prioritize its efforts towards containing the virus and providing relief to those affected</p><br />

                            23. 2. Write At least three- to four-paragraph essay on why the past is just as
important as the present. Begin your essay by talking about something
personal and why this memory is important to you. Relate your personal
experience to the larger milieu that is your community (school, barangay,
city, or even country). Why is it important to look back in order to move
forward?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The past is just as important as the present because it helps us understand who we are and where we came from. It provides us with a sense of identity and helps us learn from the mistakes of those who came before us.<p></p>For me, one of the most important memories from my past is the day I graduated from high school. It was a significant moment in my life because it marked the end of my adolescence and the beginning of my adulthood. It was a time of both excitement and uncertainty, as I was about to embark on a new journey and face new challenges.<p></p>But this personal memory is not just important to me, it is also important to my community. Graduating from high school is a milestone that is shared by many young people in my city, and it represents the hard work and dedication that we have put into our education. It also signifies our readiness to take on new responsibilities and contribute to the betterment of our community.<p></p>Looking back at this memory reminds me of the importance of education and the role it plays in shaping our future. It also serves as a reminder of the support and guidance that I received from my family, friends, and teachers, which helped me reach this point in my life.<p></p>In conclusion, the past is just as important as the present because it helps us understand ourselves and our place in the world. It provides us with a sense of identity and helps us learn from the experiences of those who came before us. By looking back at our past, we can gain valuable insights and perspectives that can help us move forward in a positive and productive way.<br />
