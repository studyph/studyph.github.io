                                            What's NewRead the article below and find out what this is all about.What makes a good family? It is the family that sustains its members, supports andnourishes cach other. A strong family unit has to create a good family values, positiveand supportive place for all members to thrive. They are able to utilize resources andlive together in a fairly healthy manner.The adults in a strong family set the tone. They are the role models that lead byexample. They reach out to trends and community and teach their children theimportance of doing the same. They work together to solve problems, and they passtheir skills on to the next generation. Some important elements of a strong family arecohesion, flexibility and communication.Cohesion- In families, cohesion would be defined as the feeling of being loved, ofand being murtured by it. Although closeness is good in afamily unit, there must be a halance between being together and being separated. Aperson must be able to develop their individuality, while being supported by hisfamily. A few things that bring a family together are the commitment of other familymembers and the spending time together.Flexibility- Flexibility in a family would mean resilience with each member, elasticin decision makings and workability with each other. We could compare a successfulfamily to a democracy. There are leaders, but the whole group is involved in thedecision-making process. Although the leaders are in charge all members develop theability to cope with stress, and at times they lead. While the family works to avoidstressful situations, they work together to solve problems, without blaming, criticizingand finding each other's fault. Families that tend to have a strong spiritual base seemto have a sense of well-being that facilitates this working together in times of stress.Communication- A lack of communication can rip a family apart and destroy them.Things that facilitate communication are closeness, flexibility, time spent togetherand spirituality. Members of the family must have the freedom to express themselvesfreely. Another very important factor is the relationship between the "head" couple.In a family that is parented by a happily married couple, people are able to expressthemselves more freely. A happy marriage seems to set the tone in the house. It spillsover from the family to the community. A healthy family will reach out to help others.They do not tend to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Families must beable to teach their children how to make good decisions. What the children learninside the house will to be carried by them.

                            16. What's NewRead the article below and find out what this is all about.What makes a good family? It is the family that sustains its members, supports andnourishes cach other. A strong family unit has to create a good family values, positiveand supportive place for all members to thrive. They are able to utilize resources andlive together in a fairly healthy manner.The adults in a strong family set the tone. They are the role models that lead byexample. They reach out to trends and community and teach their children theimportance of doing the same. They work together to solve problems, and they passtheir skills on to the next generation. Some important elements of a strong family arecohesion, flexibility and communication.Cohesion- In families, cohesion would be defined as the feeling of being loved, ofand being murtured by it. Although closeness is good in afamily unit, there must be a halance between being together and being separated. Aperson must be able to develop their individuality, while being supported by hisfamily. A few things that bring a family together are the commitment of other familymembers and the spending time together.Flexibility- Flexibility in a family would mean resilience with each member, elasticin decision makings and workability with each other. We could compare a successfulfamily to a democracy. There are leaders, but the whole group is involved in thedecision-making process. Although the leaders are in charge all members develop theability to cope with stress, and at times they lead. While the family works to avoidstressful situations, they work together to solve problems, without blaming, criticizingand finding each other's fault. Families that tend to have a strong spiritual base seemto have a sense of well-being that facilitates this working together in times of stress.Communication- A lack of communication can rip a family apart and destroy them.Things that facilitate communication are closeness, flexibility, time spent togetherand spirituality. Members of the family must have the freedom to express themselvesfreely. Another very important factor is the relationship between the "head" couple.In a family that is parented by a happily married couple, people are able to expressthemselves more freely. A happy marriage seems to set the tone in the house. It spillsover from the family to the community. A healthy family will reach out to help others.They do not tend to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Families must beable to teach their children how to make good decisions. What the children learninside the house will to be carried by them. A healthy, happy family bencfits our wholesociety, with a healthy and strong families, there will be less crime, less divorce andless emotional problems.LET'SPROCESS THISAnswer the following questions.1.
