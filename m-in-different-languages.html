Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</a>

                            1. Exercise 4 Vocalizations that might be construed as symbols of various sorts in different animals are usually accompanied by gestures. One student found that only 3 percent of the signals among rhesus monkeys were not accompanied by gestures. Whatever animals express through sounds seems to reflect not a logical sequence of thoughts but a sequence accompanying a series of emotional states. Animals' communicative activities thus differ from human language in that they consist essentially of signs not arbitrary symbols. (p.470) Markel, M. (1996).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p>actuaclly I choose number 1.</p><p> </p>Revival of GMRC a must these days<p></p><p>Lately, a favorite topic in public discussions is the proposal to revive the teaching of good manners and right conduct (GMRC) as a full school subject and for it to be added to the curriculum of the K-12 program.</p><p></p><p>For the youngsters who most likely do not know, the GMRC is a school subject that teaches kids about the importance of having basic morals, values, qualities and ethics.</p><p></p><p>In the past -- and this includes my generation -- the GMRC was taught in schools and students are not only graded for it.  There is also a certain award or medal that is given for anyone who excels in the subject and shows perfect application via behaviour in school.</p><p></p><p>Recently, we only hear of the term ‘GMRC’ in admonitions or criticisms about one’s upbringing. When someone shows ill behaviour and is chided for it, we usually hear the words, ‘maybe he was absent when GMRC was being taught in school.’</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, bringing back GMRC as part of every student’s learning process in this day and age is necessary and long overdue.</p><p></p><p>I’m sure many would share my observation on wide-ranging occasions where one could only sigh at the lack of GMRC on the part of today’s youth.</p><p></p><p>In public transportation units and other public places including Churches, you will see millennials — boys at that— sitting comfortably and pretending to be either asleep or checking on their cellphones while a pregnant woman, a mother with a baby, a handicapped or an elderly stands right in front of him or her during the entire trip or event.</p><p></p><p>These days too, you see milennials taking pictures of their food before eating instead of saying grace. The words ‘po’ and ‘opo’, the blessing of the hands of the elderly and saying ‘please’, ‘excuse me’ and ‘thank you’ have become like gems. They are that rare already when  during the olden days, they were basic good manners.</p><p></p><p>The level of discipline and respectful behavior among children and teens of today is unquestionably at an all-time low.</p><p></p><p>Notice that even in restaurants, you see a table with family members who do not even talk, since they are all preoccupied with their gadgets.  Youngsters these days no longer respect food and what we call as ‘hapag-kainan’ and treat eating as a sideline while they are on their cellphones.</p><p></p><p>I read somewhere that most of the generation of today are on the internet for as long as ten hours a day.</p><p>Given this situation, I hope that the GMRC, should it be really revived, be taught with the kind of approach that would make it compatible to the prevailing lifestyle which revolves around technology.</p><p></p><p>There is no doubt though, that there is a current urgent need to institutionalize the GMRC as a subject in both elementary and high schools and yes, maybe even all the way up to college.</p><p></p><p>Senator Joel Villanueva, who filed Senate Bill 860 or the proposed Comprehensive Values Education Act, mentioned in a hearing: ‘We can’t discount the fact that Values Education or Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao (ESP) is already included in the Department of Education curriculum, yet there is a clamor for the revival of GMRC in the curriculum, and this clamor is indeed proper, given realities that we observe in our manner of conducting affairs in various aspects of our daily lives as Filipinos.’</p><p></p><p>The problem with ESP is that it is reportedly being taught in public schools for only 30 minutes.  This is certainly not enough.</p><p></p><p>/im sorry its not exact in what your limit word is but hope it help/</p><p>#CarryOnlearning</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</h2><br />
