Write your answer in the given answer sheet. Safety Practices Advantages Disadvantages 1. 1 2. 2. 3. 3.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The <strong>disadvantage </strong>of safety practices is: Companies that ignore safety put employees in unfavorable circumstances that increase the likelihood of accidents, injuries and illnesses. This can affect a company's bottom line when workers end up injured or ill because of the increased costs of workers' compensation insurance and injured employees missing work. When you work for someone else, understand your rights under the law. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 gives you the right to a safe workplace.
</p><p>
And the <strong>advantages</strong> is: Following health and safety guidelines is primarily to protect employers and their staff from injury, illness or coming into any other form of harm in the workplace. One of the main benefits of following health and safety practices is to prevent common workplaces injuries such as back pain, falling from height, asthma, injuries from slips and trips and asbestos-related illness.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The way you dress for an interview gives potential employers their first impression of how you present yourself professionally. Even if you look great on paper, if you don’t dress appropriately for an interview, you give the impression that you lack respect for yourself and those you are meeting with.</p><p></p><p>Judgment</p><p>Your outward appearance in an interview is an employer's first glimpse of your judgment skills. If you’re applying for a high-level professional job in an industry in which wearing tailored suits are the norm, showing up in anything else can indicate that you don’t know what’s expected or that you don’t care and you're flouting the standards. Likewise, if you’re applying for a job as a kindergarten teacher and you show up to your interview in club wear, you’re demonstrating that you aren't reading the situation correctly.</p><p></p><p>Professionalism</p><p>Dressing appropriately for work isn’t simply a matter of looking professional; it’s also an indication that you recognize that norms and standards exist because they are expectations that need to be followed. Even if you believe that you should be judged on your talent and ability and not on your appearance, dressing appropriately for the situation shows that you have respect for your employer and clients, and you are willing to follow the directives in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>Confidence</p><p>Dressing professionally can give you a boost of confidence, putting you in a work frame of mind. It’s even recommended that you dress in work attire for telephone interviews, simply because it puts you in a difference mindset than if you are interviewing in your bathrobe or a pair of shorts. When you look your best, it has the potential to bring out your best performance.</p><p></p><p>Respect</p><p>Dressing in the right attire for an interview shows that you’re serious about the job, respectful of the interviewer's time, and are genuinely interested in the position. It also demonstrates an understanding of the corporate culture, and showcases you as someone who would fit easily into the workplace dynamic.</p><p></p><p>A large part of dressing to impress in an interview is in learning about the company in advance of the interview and getting a feel for how people outfit themselves. Based on your findings, step things up a notch to make a good impression. For example, if jeans and button-ups are the norm, wear slacks and a sports coat; if slacks and a sports coat are the norm, wear a suit and tie. Once you get the job you can alter your appearance to whatever the everyday business norm looks like.</p><br />
