                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. Here are 4 of the top ways having the internet in the classroom can benefit both students and teachers:</p><p></p><p>Access to more information</p><p>One of the biggest advantages is that it gives teachers and students the ability to access all different types of information from resources from across the globe. No longer limited by out-of-date encyclopedias, the anything you want to learn is only a click away.</p><p></p><p>Teachers also have a lot more resources at their fingertips, which can greatly improve their lesson planning process.</p><p></p><p>Bridge communication gaps</p><p>Having the internet in classrooms can also help teachers avoid communication mishaps. When messages and information are shared digitally, misplaced notes and lost assignment sheets become a thing of the past.</p><p></p><p>The internet can also improve class community and camaraderie by facilitating communication outside of the classroom. Class websites or blogs can give students the ability to download assignments and materials, talk with other students, and share their work. Email and messaging can also make it easier for students to ask questions after hours, instead of having to wait until the next day and risk forgetting the question.</p><p></p><p>This type of communication is also great for parents who can receive updates and reminders digitally. Instead of having to dig through their kid’s backpack after school to make sure they haven’t missed an important note from the teacher they can just check their email or class website.</p><p></p><p>Enjoy virtual field trips</p><p>With the internet in the classroom, students have the ability to take virtual field trips – without ever having to leave the school. For example, students who are studying animals of Africa, the Great Pyramids in Egypt, or the Great Wall of China can watch videos or take virtual tours of these places without even leaving their seats.</p><p></p><p>If a school is struggling with budgets or located in a rural area, going to a virtual zoo or online museum can give students the chance to see things “up close” that they may not otherwise be able to see.</p><p></p><p>Assignment convenience and flexibility</p><p>It is well documented that students have different learning styles. Access to assignments online after hours can give students the ability to complete assignments on their own timetable. Having a way for students to study or submit assignments from home can greatly help students who suffer from test anxiety or have difficulty concentrating in a busy classroom.</p><p></p><p>E-rate discount program</p><p>All students and teachers should be able to experience the benefits listed above. Although not all schools have the same budgets and resources, the US government has taken steps to ensure that all libraries and schools in the United States have access to robust broadband connectivity through the E-Rate Discount Program.</p><p></p><p>References: https://www.tfeconnect.com/4-benefits-of-having-internet-in-the-classroom/</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>3. Some of the disadvantages are: unrepresentative samples, lower response rates, financial motivation issues, limited access to certain portals, limited length of study, non-behavioral data, and lack of follow-up data.</p><br />

Here are some advantages and disadvantages of the internet in education.<p></p>Advantages:1.The Internet Promotes Opportunities<p></p><p>Regardless of whether you’re a current student or not, education never seems to have an absolute end. There’s always room for more learning as you utilize what you learned some years ago. And the internet is a huge source of information. You’ll always get new, existing, and historical information from online magazines, books, journals, research publications, websites, blogs, and new sites. There are multiples disciplines and courses you can take online.  You can even pursue a masters in special education. </p><p></p><p></p> DisadvantagesThe internet also doesn’t come with unappealing traits when it comes to education. For one, it can promote laziness among students in some cases, especially depending on the level of study. For instance, consider a student who’s given an assignment and ends up copy-pasting content from the internet.Additionally, no technology has been discovered yet, that can restrict adult content to adults only. It has to be done manually. Most online adult content providers only require the user’s content that they’re an adult or at least over 18 before giving access to content. There’s no reliable way to verify that the user is actually over 18. The internet can thus be said to promote exposure to inappropriate and sometimes promiscuous content.<br />
