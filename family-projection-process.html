Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.

Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.
- Adapted, McCormack 61
