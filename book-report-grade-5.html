Column B
1. How do effective
writers hook and hold their
readers?
A. No, this is not a thought-provoking question
although the format of the question may
arouse interest, it doesn't really open up good
question. At best, it can lead to a definition of
term
2. Onomatopoeia-
what's up with that?
B. Yes, this is a thought-provoking question
because this is a rich question for exploring
the many
features of effective writing,
including
different
genres,
audience/purpose,
connections, writer's
voice, and organizational structures.
_3. What are the limits of
arithmetic?
C. No, this is a useful question for helping us
understand the concept of adaptation in
various manifestations. However, there are
specific answers that could be found in a
book.
4. What are examples of
animals adapting to their
environment?
D. Yes, this is a thought-provoking question,
widely applicable across mathematical topics
across the grades; the question helps us come
to understand an abstract yet important idea.
5. Is biology a destiny?
E. Yes. This is intended to be a thought-
provoking, open question with nuances (so
don't be fooled by phrasing)

Column B
1. How do effective
writers hook and hold their
readers?
A. No, this is not a thought-provoking question
although the format of the question may
arouse interest, it doesn't really open up good
question. At best, it can lead to a definition of
term
2. Onomatopoeia-
what's up with that?
B. Yes, this is a thought-provoking question
because this is a rich question for exploring
the many
features of effective writing,
including
different
genres,
audience/purpose,
connections, writer's
voice, and organizational structures.
_3. What are the limits of
arithmetic?
C. No, this is a useful question for helping us
understand the concept of adaptation in
various manifestations. However, there are
specific answers that could be found in a
book.
4. What are examples of
animals adapting to their
environment?
D. Yes, this is a thought-provoking question,
widely applicable across mathematical topics
across the grades; the question helps us come
to understand an abstract yet important idea.
5. Is biology a destiny?
E. Yes. This is intended to be a thought-
provoking, open question with nuances (so
don't be fooled by phrasing)

If a P10,000 deposit become P10,800 after a year, how much interest rate was given?INCORRECT ANSWER = REPORTCORRECT ANSWER = BRAINLIEST</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>interest was earned at an annual interest rate of 8%?</p><p></p><p>Ana's new grade is 89.25. To calculate, you can first find 5% of her previous grade by multiplying 85 by 0.05 to get 4.25. Then, you can add this amount to her previous grade: 85 + 4.25 = 89.25.</p><p></p><p>The discount rate is 30%. To calculate, you can first find the amount of the discount by subtracting the new price from the old price: 500 - 350 = 150. Then, you can calculate the discount rate by dividing the amount of the discount by the old price and multiplying by 100: (150/500) x 100 = 30%.</p><p></p><p>The salesman was able to sell P150,000 worth of goods. To calculate, you can use the formula: commission = rate x sales. Rearranging this formula to solve for sales, you get: sales = commission / rate. Substituting the given values, you get: sales = 15,000 / 0.1 = 150,000.</p><p></p><p>The groceries will now cost ₱784. To calculate, you can multiply the original price by 1 plus the VAT rate (expressed as a decimal): 700 x 1.12 = 784.</p><p></p><p>The interest earned is P800. To calculate, you can use the formula: interest = principal x rate x time. Substituting the given values, you get: interest = 10,000 x 0.08 x 1 = 800.</p><br />
