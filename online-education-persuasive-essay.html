Identify the writing technique used in each number. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.1. CEBU CITY, Philippines - Local officials in Cebu City have reiterated their reminders to the public not to let their guard down just yet against the coronavirus. disease 2019 (COVID-19) now that December is just one sleep away. This as they discovered that most of the new confirmed cases of the infection has happened to be asymptomatic or infected individuals showing no symptoms of the disease.2. According to statistics, there is a 60.78% of the Filipino parents want their children to finish their studies, while 30.23% of them are saying that they just want their children to get a decent and permanent job someday, and the remaining 3.99\% are believing that skills will lead their children to a better day. From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year. Duque warned that the risk of contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases when they mingle. with family members from other areas. He also encouraged the use of teleconferencing instead to meet other family members.4. You get to follow to what our good leader is telling you for he is a man of faith, words, and action. Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6. Now, the darkest days and nights of our lives comes to an end as the most. reliable, most durable, most energy efficient, and unlike the leading brand, the brightest yet the cheapest LED LIGHT is now born.​​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>   <strong>Title: Online Education</strong><p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p><p>Online education is a form of education where students use their home computers through the internet since the pandemic started. It is the new way to continue education while the Covid 19 is still spreading.</p><p></p>BODY:<p> Online learning offers teachers an efficient way to deliver lessons to students. Online learning has a number of tools such as videos, PDFs, podcasts, and teachers can use all these tools as part of their lesson plans. </p><p>Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the environment.</p><p> However, For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. </p><p></p>CONCLUSION:<p>With online learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media or other sites. </p><p>Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep their online classes crisp, engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused on the lesson.</p><p>While internet penetration has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years, in smaller cities and towns, a consistent connection with decent speed is a problem. Without a consistent internet connection for students or teachers, there can be a lack of continuity in learning for the child. </p><p>This increase in screen time is one of the biggest concerns and disadvantages of online learning. Sometimes students also develop bad posture and other physical problems due to staying hunched in front of a screen.</p><p>A good solution to this would be to give the students plenty of breaks from the screen to refresh their mind and their body.</p><p></p>SANA PO MAKATULONG :)<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
