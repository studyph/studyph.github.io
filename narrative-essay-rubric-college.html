                            19. essay disagree about "why everyone should not go to college?"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Not everyone should go to college. College is not for everyone, and there are many reasons why someone might choose not to pursue higher education. For some, the cost of college is too high and they cannot afford it. Others may have family obligations that prevent them from attending college or they may simply not be interested in pursuing a degree. Additionally, some people may feel that college is not the best way for them to learn and develop their skills. For these individuals, there are other options such as trade schools or apprenticeships that can provide them with the skills they need to succeed in their chosen field. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide if college is right for them or not.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong ☺️</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>While college education is often seen as a prerequisite for success in today's society, there are some who argue that not everyone should attend college. However, I strongly disagree with this view and believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a college education is not just about obtaining a degree. It is about gaining knowledge, skills, and experience that can be applied in a wide range of industries and professions. A college education provides students with critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and the ability to work collaboratively with others. These skills are highly valued by employers and are essential for success in today's competitive job market.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, a college education can provide individuals with opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. College provides a diverse and multicultural environment that can expose individuals to different perspectives and worldviews. This can broaden their understanding of the world and help them to develop empathy and compassion for others.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, a college education can also provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests. By studying a subject they are passionate about, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject and develop the skills necessary to pursue a career in that field. This can lead to a more fulfilling and rewarding career.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a college education is not just about the individual, but it is also about society as a whole. College graduates are more likely to be active and engaged citizens, and they are more likely to contribute to their communities. They are also more likely to earn higher salaries and pay more in taxes, which benefits society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some may argue that not everyone should attend college, I strongly disagree with this view. A college education is not just about obtaining a degree, but it is about gaining knowledge, skills, and experience that can be applied in a wide range of industries and professions. It provides individuals with opportunities for personal growth, the pursuit of their passions, and it benefits society as a whole. Therefore, everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education, regardless of their background or circumstances.</p><p></p><br />

In this essay, I will discuss why I am passionate about attending college and what I hope to contribute to the academic community.</p><p></p><p>My interest in higher education began with my parents. Neither of them attended college, and they always encouraged me to pursue this opportunity. To prepare myself for college, I have taken challenging courses in high school, participated in extracurricular activities, and volunteered for community service. These experiences have taught me the value of hard work, leadership, and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons I want to attend college is to gain knowledge and skills that will prepare me for a successful career.

                            22. make a college of the effects of noise to people by using the available materials at home be guided by the rubrics below .​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The word rubric comes from the Latin word for red. The online Merriam-Webster dictionary lists the first meaning of rubric as "an authoritative rule" and the fourth meaning as "a guide listing specific criteria for grading or scoring academic papers, projects, or tests." How did the name for a color come to mean a rule or guide? At least as far back as the Middle Ages, the rules for the conduct of liturgical services—as opposed to the actual spoken words of the liturgy—were often printed in red, so the rules were "the red things" on the page.</p><p></p><p>In this book, I will show that rubrics for classroom use are both more and less than the dictionary definition suggests. They are more because rubrics are good for much more than just grading or scoring. They are less because not just any set of rules or guides for student work are rubrics. This first chapter lays out some basic concepts about rubrics. Chapter 2 illustrates common misconceptions about rubrics, and Chapter 3 describes how to write or select effective rubrics</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ON </strong><strong>LEARNING</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Print mo yung mga pic, sabay e Arrange mo ng katulad nung pic na ni send ko</p><br />

                            30. essay about college education is necessary for everyone​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>College is really necessary to us because With more and more careers requiring advanced education, a college degree can be critical to your success in today's workforce. Research indicates that earning a degree can have a significant and expansive impact on your life. In general, succeeding without going to college is possible. After all, not all employers require degrees, and not all college graduates are employed. However, in some instances, the absence of a college degree can hinder benefits such as more career opportunities and higher lifetime earnings.</strong><strong><br />Here are some reasons why college is really important:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Increase Chances of Employment<br />It's not uncommon to see "bachelor's degree required" on job descriptions or listed as a preferred qualification. A 2020 survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) in collaboration with Hanover Research found that a growing number of employers deem college a good investment. An undergraduate program, which includes associate and bachelor's degrees, offers a combination of general education courses and specialized learning in a discipline that interests you. With these degrees, you'll develop both broad-based and field-specific knowledge. You may also have a chance to grow important hard and soft skills by participating in experiential learning opportunities, which are relevant, hands-on experiences you can translate to the professional world. Experiential learning takes many forms and may exist both in and out of the classroom. Additional types of experiential learning you might take advantage of in college include project-based assignments that partner with real organizations, internships, and student clubs and organizations. You can leverage these valuable experiences on your resume, in your portfolio of work, and during the job, interviews to show employers that you are a competitive candidate. Earning a college degree could also lead to greater career stability. According to BLS data, 3.5% of workers with a bachelor’s degree faced unemployment in 2021 compared to 6.2% of workers with only a high school diploma.<br />2. Expand Your Opportunities<br />A college degree can be the extra credential you need to land the dream job you've always wanted. Getting your bachelor's degree may also allow you to view your work as a career, not just a job.</strong></p><p><strong>A 2016 Pew Research Center report states that 77% of workers with a post-graduate degree and 60% of workers with a bachelor's degree believe their jobs give them a sense of identity, versus just 38% of those with only a high school diploma or less.</strong></p><p><strong>This idea still holds today. The Lumina Foundation and Gallup noted in The State of Higher Education 2022 Report that 61% of students enrolled in higher education are getting their degrees to find more fulfilling jobs. An example of this is recent graduate Victoria Meuse '22, who was able to advance to a teaching position with the help of her bachelor's degree. Meuse is a military spouse, and during the pandemic and her husband's deployment, she homeschooled her oldest daughter. This experience inspired her to continue teaching, and now with her degree, Meuse is starting a new role at her children's elementary school. "Right now, I love working at my kid's school. I think that the background in psychology has helped me a lot in understanding the students," said Meuse. "I'm deciding if I want my master's in psychology or my master's in education, but I'm not done. "While working in your degree program, you're choosing to study something that interests you in a field you desire to work or grow in.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Prepare for the Future</strong></p><p><strong>You can also gain practical life skills as a college student. For example, you will need to meet regular assignment deadlines for each class. The discipline and time management strategies you learn along the way can be applied to all aspects of your life, whether you're navigating projects at work or your family's busy schedule. Since your earning potential is typically greater as a college graduate, your degree may lead toward financial stability for you and your family. Your school's finance counselors can walk you through more than just how to pay for college. With their tips and advice, you may discover helpful budgeting techniques and learn more about financing options and processes that may be relevant to future investments—such as purchasing a car or a home. Homeowners are increasingly more likely to be college educated. Point2, an organization that reports on real estate market trends, analyzed U.S. Census data to find that 70% of homeowners in 2020 had some college education. Forty percent had at least a bachelor's degree.</strong></p><br />
