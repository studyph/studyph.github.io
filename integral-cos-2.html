This method is based on the belief that behavior is learnt in response to past experience and can be unleamtor renonditioned.2. This is a therapy that negative ways of thinking are explored in structured and directive ways involving diarykeeping, progress charts etc.3. This is used to treat a family system rather than individual members of the family.4. This approach encourages people to think about their feelings and take responsibility for their thoughts andactions.5. It is also called individual psychology and focuses on creating a therapeutic relationship that is co-operative,encouraging and practical.6. The main aim of this method is to change behavior, which is done by applying techniques with a focus onproblem-solving, such as homework, diary cards and behavioral analysis.7. This is based on the theory that there is no proof that any one theoretical approach works better than allothers for a specific problem.8.his is based on the work of Sigmund Freud, who believed that the unacceptable thoughts of early childhoodare banished to the unconscious mind but continue to influence thoughts, emotions and behavior.9. The name is derived from the German for organized whole. Developed by Fritz Perls it focuses on the wholeof the client's experience, including feelings, thoughts and actions.10 This is when several distinct models of counseling and psychotherapy are used together.pa help popa help​</a>

                                            1.  At 4:45 pm, your principal dictates a couple of letters which you will send by courier on the same day. Your principal has never asked you before to take last minute dictation. This afternoon, however, you have an appointment with a former classmate to meet at a restaurant at 5:30 pm. What should you do?2. You are the guidance counselor to the school. One of your biggest private school in the province, Mrs. Cruz, came one day very angry, demanding to see your teacher about problems about her child and the teacher. Before she had the chance to see your teacher, she kept on talking about her complaints and poured all her negative views about the school to you. How would you handle the situations? What should you do?3.  Ms. Cruz had to work overtime in the school to finish a rush job. It was past dinnertime and she was extremely hungry. On opening the refrigerator in the principal’s office, she discovered two apples inside. She decided to eat the apples. Comment on the action taken by Ms. Cruz.4.  Ms. Stella is a highly attractive young faculty who works as classroom teacher. She is in charge of the school canteen. One day, the principal told Ms. Stella that she is currently selling junk foods and other food which are prohibited. Ms. Stella did this without the knowledge of the school because this is an extra income for her. If you are Ms. Stella, How will you explain your side? What would be your response?5.  Mr. Cruz is regarded as the best teacher in their school. He is known not only because he teaches well but also because of his integrity and credibility. In addition, he is also an adviser in their barangay. Without the knowledge of everyone he is consistently attending the cockfight in his adjacent town every other day. He is known of betting a big money in every game. Can he continue doing this considering his profession as a teacher? What is your opinion regarding the principles of integrity and values formation for teachers. 6.  Teacher Myla is a new teacher. She realizes that handling her student’s misbehavior is a very            demanding aspect of classroom management. In this regard, she thought of giving up teaching.                 What advice can you give her? 7.      Teacher Agnes is a neophyte teacher.

This method is based on the belief that behavior is learnt in response to past experience and can be unleamtor renonditioned.2. This is a therapy that negative ways of thinking are explored in structured and directive ways involving diarykeeping, progress charts etc.3. This is used to treat a family system rather than individual members of the family.4. This approach encourages people to think about their feelings and take responsibility for their thoughts andactions.5. It is also called individual psychology and focuses on creating a therapeutic relationship that is co-operative,encouraging and practical.6. The main aim of this method is to change behavior, which is done by applying techniques with a focus onproblem-solving, such as homework, diary cards and behavioral analysis.7. This is based on the theory that there is no proof that any one theoretical approach works better than allothers for a specific problem.8.his is based on the work of Sigmund Freud, who believed that the unacceptable thoughts of early childhoodare banished to the unconscious mind but continue to influence thoughts, emotions and behavior.9. The name is derived from the German for organized whole. Developed by Fritz Perls it focuses on the wholeof the client's experience, including feelings, thoughts and actions.10 This is when several distinct models of counseling and psychotherapy are used together.pa help popa help​</h2><br />

                            10. 1.  At 4:45 pm, your principal dictates a couple of letters which you will send by courier on the same day. Your principal has never asked you before to take last minute dictation. This afternoon, however, you have an appointment with a former classmate to meet at a restaurant at 5:30 pm. What should you do?2. You are the guidance counselor to the school. One of your biggest private school in the province, Mrs. Cruz, came one day very angry, demanding to see your teacher about problems about her child and the teacher. Before she had the chance to see your teacher, she kept on talking about her complaints and poured all her negative views about the school to you. How would you handle the situations? What should you do?3.  Ms. Cruz had to work overtime in the school to finish a rush job. It was past dinnertime and she was extremely hungry. On opening the refrigerator in the principal’s office, she discovered two apples inside. She decided to eat the apples. Comment on the action taken by Ms. Cruz.4.  Ms. Stella is a highly attractive young faculty who works as classroom teacher. She is in charge of the school canteen. One day, the principal told Ms. Stella that she is currently selling junk foods and other food which are prohibited. Ms. Stella did this without the knowledge of the school because this is an extra income for her. If you are Ms. Stella, How will you explain your side? What would be your response?5.  Mr. Cruz is regarded as the best teacher in their school. He is known not only because he teaches well but also because of his integrity and credibility. In addition, he is also an adviser in their barangay. Without the knowledge of everyone he is consistently attending the cockfight in his adjacent town every other day. He is known of betting a big money in every game. Can he continue doing this considering his profession as a teacher? What is your opinion regarding the principles of integrity and values formation for teachers. 6.  Teacher Myla is a new teacher. She realizes that handling her student’s misbehavior is a very            demanding aspect of classroom management. In this regard, she thought of giving up teaching.                 What advice can you give her? 7.      Teacher Agnes is a neophyte teacher. One time a mother of one of her students confronted her and maligned her in front of her colleagues. How should Teacher Agnes react on this kind of situation?8. You discover that your principal is having an affair with your co-teacher which so happen as your    best friend. They are both married. What should you do?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can help you with this problem. I assume you want to find the ages of S and C in terms of x, where x is the common factor of their ages. To do this, we need to use the ratio and the given information. Let’s write the ratio as:</p><p></p><p>S/C = 3/2</p><p></p><p>This means that S is 3 times some number x, and C is 2 times some number x. So we can write:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x C = 2x</p><p></p><p>Now, we are given that five years later, the sum of their ages will be 40. That means:</p><p></p><p>(S + 5) + (C + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Substituting S and C with 3x and 2x, we get:</p><p></p><p>(3x + 5) + (2x + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Simplifying and solving for x, we get:</p><p></p><p>5x + 10 = 40 5x = 30 x = 6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the value of x is 6. To find the ages of S and C, we just need to plug in x into the expressions for S and C:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x = 3 × 6 = 18 C = 2x = 2 × 6 = 12</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the age of S is 18 years and the age of C is 12 years.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
