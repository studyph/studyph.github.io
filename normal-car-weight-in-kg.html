                    <p>1. The mean content of a box of cat food is 2.50 kg, and the standard deviation of
the content of a box is 0.030 kg. There are 24 boxes in a case, and there are 400
cases in a car load as it leaves the factory. What is the standard deviation of the
amount of cat food contained in (i) a case, and (ii) a car load?
2. The design load on a hoist is 50 tonnes. The hoist is used to lift packages each
having a mean weight of 1.2 tonnes. The weights of individual packages are
known to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.3 tonnes. If 40
packages are lifted at one time, what is the probability that the design load on the
hoist will be exceeded?

sugar?
b) Find the upper quartile of sugar content of a carton.
c) What mean weight of an individual bag of sugar will result in 95% of the
pallets weighing more than 1200 kg.?</p>
