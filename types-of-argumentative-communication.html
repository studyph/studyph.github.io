                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Why cramming for tests often fails.</strong></p><p>         </p><p>         We've all had to take a difficult exam at some point in our life. Whether it's a school paper, a university final, or even a job exam, we're nearly always told to develop a study plan. We may spread out our preparation for the test with a strategy rather than depending on one or two hard study sessions the night before to get us through. It is sound advice. In three words, cramming does not work. Unfortunately, many of us do not follow this guideline. </p><p></p><p>            Memory research indicates that we have a concerning propensity to depend on our familiarity with studying things to inform our judgments of whether or not we know them. The issue is that familiarity is poor at predicting whether we will remember anything. The cramming has left a residual glow of activity in our sensory and memory systems, allowing our brain to quickly label our study notes as "something I've seen before." Recognizing something, however, is not the same as recalling it. </p><p></p><p>            As a result, the advice to stretch out our study periods only makes sense if we presume that people aren't already spacing out their study sessions sufficiently (a safe assumption, given the research findings). We need to be reminded of the advantages of spaced learning since it goes against our propensity to rely on a familiar feeling of comfort when determining how to study.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>And that got Running thinking: exactly where is the hottest place on Earth? With some colleagues at the University of Montana, he did some research and found that the location of the world’s hottest spot changes, though the conditions don’t. Think dry, rocky, and dark-colored lands.
</p><p>
</p><p>In July 1913, observers in Furnace Creek, California—Death Valley—watched the thermometer reach 56.7°C (134°F) and declared it to be the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. But just nine years later, on September 13, 1922, a weather station in El Azizia, Libya, recorded a temperature of 58.0°C (136.4°F). According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), that remains the highest air temperature ever measured.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Yet most of the places that call themselves the hottest on Earth are not even serious contenders,” says Running. The reason is partly about where the measurements are made. But it is also a tale about how temperature is measured.</p><br />
