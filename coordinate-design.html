                            1. 136. Physical exercises designed to developed strength and coordination.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First, let's determine what we mean by strength. For preschool and kindergarten children, we are not talking about strength/conditioning programs (such as those in high schools) that focus on developing targeted muscle groups. Rather, young children need overall strength so that they can participate in a wide variety of activities, derive pleasure from those activities, gain confidence in their abilities to "do things" and, in fact, have the strength to "do things" - particularly new things.</p><p>Coordination is another ability that begins developing "on its own" as infants explore their bodies and their world. Eye-hand coordination begins to develop as babies first start to put fingers together, reach for toes, and reach for objects. Overall coordination grows as babies learn to roll over, sit, crawl, stand, and walk. So by coordination, we mean a, series of movements organized and timed to occur in a particular way to bring about a particular result.</p><p></p><p>When we start thinking about and planning for strength and coordination in young children, we have to realize that like all developmental issues, there are going to be individual differences, and, in general, development is going to happen at its own rate. You cannot "make" development happen; you can only support it by creating the right environment for each child as he reaches a particular point on the developmental continuum.</p><br />

For example, if the points of the quadrilateral are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), and (7,8), you would plot the first point at the intersection of the x-axis and y-axis, the second point at (3,4), the third point at (5,6), and the fourth point at (7,8).</p><p></p><p>Connect the points of the quadrilateral to form the sides of the quadrilateral.</p><p></p><p>Name the points of the quadrilateral. You can use letters to label the points, such as A, B, C, and D.</p><p></p><p>Calculate the distance and slope of each side of the quadrilateral. To find the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), you can use the distance formula: distance = √((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). To find the slope of a line, you can use the slope formula: slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).</p><p></p><p>Use creativity and design to make your graph visually appealing. You can use different colors or line styles to distinguish between the sides of the quadrilateral, or you can add labels or other design elements to the graph.</p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p></p><p>Suppose we are given the points (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), and (7,8) as the vertices of a quadrilateral.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>D. Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating and Controlling</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Henri Fayol was one of the first theorists to define functions of management in his 1916 book “Administration Industrielle et Generale”. Henri Fayol identified 5 functions of management, which he labelled: planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating and controlling. Henri Fayol theorized that these functions were universal, and that every manager performed these functions in their daily work.</p><p></p><p>The 5 functions put forward by Henri Fayol may therefore not completely represent the total complexity faced by managers, and the normative approach may be too rigid to illustrate which functions managers need to perform in modern contemporary companies and organizations. However, the 5 functions presented by Henri Fayol give a structured overview of several tasks needed to be performed by all managers, which gives managers an initial overview of which main functions they should be focusing on in their daily work. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/302618</p><br />
