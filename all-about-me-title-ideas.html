                                            Let's Elaborate Read the excerpt below and do the activities that follow. What Are Filipinos Like (Excerpt)               Leon Ma. Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves. Reflect: What assurance does the author give in the last part? If the Filipinos have some negative traits and attitudes, to whom shall these be attributed?​</a>

                                            The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                                            The Rat Trap (Author Unknown)A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was aghast to discover that it was a rat trap. Retreating to the barnyard the rat proclaimed the warning: "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!"The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Rat, I can tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it." The rat turned to the pig and told him, "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!" "I am so very sorry Mr. Rat," sympathized the pig, "but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured that you are in my prayers."The rat turned to the cow. She said, "Like wow, Mr. Rat. a rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?"So the rat returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer's rat trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever.Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchetto the barnyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer butchered the pig.The farmer's wife did not get well. She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.Literary Criticism using using Moralist approach.1.IntroductionTitle:Author:II.Body (Summary)III.

could anyone please help me? this is my first time making a defense title and i have no idea what to do despite watching multiple videos about defense titles already (most of them are in filipino and i have a hard time understand tagalog despite being a filipino ToT)
our topic or title or whatever is "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, a defense title is a concise and clear statement that summarizes the main point or argument of your research project. It should be brief and to the point, and provide a clear indication of the purpose and scope of your work. In the case of your topic, "The Effects of Fossil Fuel: Is it Harmful to the Environment?", it seems that your research is focused on examining the environmental impact of the use of fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>To start, you can break down your title into three key components:</p><p></p><p>The Effects of Fossil Fuel - This part of your title indicates the focus of your research, which is on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source that is extracted from the earth, and include coal, oil, and natural gas.</p><p></p><p>Is it Harmful - This part of your title introduces the central question of your research, which is whether the use of fossil fuels is harmful to the environment. This question can be further refined by identifying specific aspects of the environment that are impacted by the use of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, water pollution, and climate change.</p><p></p><p>To the Environment - This part of your title indicates the scope of your research, which is focused specifically on the environmental impact of fossil fuels. It is important to be clear and specific about the scope of your research in your defense title, as this will help your audience understand the focus of your work.</p><p></p><p>Based on these three key components, you can revise your defense title to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised defense title:</p><p></p><p>"The Environmental Impact of Fossil Fuels: Assessing the Harmful Effects on Air, Water, and Climate"</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you to better understand how to craft a defense title for your research project. Good luck with your defense!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Guerrero Nothing is so difficult as self-appraisal, and to answer the question in the title of this article I thought it best to start by asking it. With no particular pattern in mind, 1 asked a number of foreign friends to give me their impression of the Filipino. I was told that we were friendly, good-natured, loyal, idealistic, sentimental, socially gracious ("even the lower classes"), unwilling to accept responsibility, lacking in self-reliance, less hardworking than the Chinese, more intelligent than the Malays, imitative but less so than the Japanese, religious but not so mystical as the Indians, and, in general, the most adaptable of all the races in the Orient. A Spaniard thought we were very like the Spanish; an American thought we were Dot American enough. A Frenchman remarked we were the only people in Asia with a sense of humor, at least the only ones who could laugh at themselves, which, when one thinks of it, was probably the prettiest compliment of all. By way of contrasts, our fellow Asians had a uniform tendency to laugh at us. A Siamese said we were pretentious. An Indonesian, in much the same yein, deplored our tendency to accept western standards at their face value. A Chinese thought we were zonpresident. An Indian was shocked by the cheapness in which human life was held by a people that could kill for a few centavos, a political argument, or a girl's ruffled feelings. The history of the Philippines might well be read in these national characteristics. There is, to start with, a relatively simple explanation for our notorious lack of self-reliance, which seem to be the main burden of compliment against us these days. For mor than four centuries of colonial rule, we were not allowed to rely on ourselves. Colonialism also suggests the reason for a certain unwillingness to accept responsibility, for too long in our history, it was not accompanied by any real authority.Reflect: How is the Filipino described in the text? What qualities did you like? What about the qualities that you did not  like?All in all, it would not be too far from the truth to say that we owe our faults to others, but our virtues are our own. Colonialism, through its various interpreters, made us irresponsible and imitative, improvident, and even "indolent." It gave us false ideas of the indignity of manual labor and the security of government job. It made us indifferent to our responsibilities to ourselves.

                            13. The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                            16. The Rat Trap (Author Unknown)A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was aghast to discover that it was a rat trap. Retreating to the barnyard the rat proclaimed the warning: "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!"The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Rat, I can tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it." The rat turned to the pig and told him, "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!" "I am so very sorry Mr. Rat," sympathized the pig, "but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured that you are in my prayers."The rat turned to the cow. She said, "Like wow, Mr. Rat. a rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?"So the rat returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer's rat trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever.Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchetto the barnyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer butchered the pig.The farmer's wife did not get well. She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.Literary Criticism using using Moralist approach.1.IntroductionTitle:Author:II.Body (Summary)III.
