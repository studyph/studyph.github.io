Directions: Rewrite a story given below using either flashback or in medias res. Specify the technique used to
develop the plot
Ken is one of the most dedicated pupils in elementary. Although his family cannot afford some of
his needs as a pupil, he always walks at recognition day to accept his awards. During the last quarter in
grade six, he is confident that he is going to get another award for his family, but the COVID 19 cases grew
bigger. People's movements were limited, classes were suspended, and community quarantine was
implemented. Even his final walk as an elementary pupil did not happen. He felt lonely and disappointed
about not walking in the middle of the crowd with his parents. But his parents were aware that he is not
feeling good about the situation. They explained to Ken that there is nothing to worry about and that.
they are still proud of him. There are still chances on being with him, walking in the middle of the crowd,
to get his diploma and awards. He felt happy and continued to study, the best way he can.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

Ken is one of the most dedicated pupils in elementary. Although his family cannot afford some of his needs as a pupil, he always walks at recognition day to accept his awards. During the last quarter in grade six, he is confident that he is going to get another award for his family, but the COVID- 19 cases grew bigger. People’s movements were limited, classes were suspended, and community quarantine was implemented. Even his final walk as an elementary pupil did not happen. He felt lonely and disappointed about not walking in the middle of the crowd with his parents. But his parents were aware that he is not feeling good about the situation. They explained to Ken that there is nothing to worry about and that, they are still proud of him. There are still chances on being with him, walking in the middle of the crowd, to get his diploma and awards. He felt happy and continued to study, the best way he can.

Directions: Rewrite a story given below using either flashback or in medias res. Specify the technique used to
develop the plot
Ken is one of the most dedicated pupils in elementary. Although his family cannot afford some of
his needs as a pupil, he always walks at recognition day to accept his awards. During the last quarter in
grade six, he is confident that he is going to get another award for his family, but the COVID 19 cases grew
bigger. People's movements were limited, classes were suspended, and community quarantine was
implemented. Even his final walk as an elementary pupil did not happen. He felt lonely and disappointed
about not walking in the middle of the crowd with his parents. But his parents were aware that he is not
feeling good about the situation. They explained to Ken that there is nothing to worry about and that.
they are still proud of him. There are still chances on being with him, walking in the middle of the crowd,
to get his diploma and awards. He felt happy and continued to study, the best way he can.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />
