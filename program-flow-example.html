It provides guides on how to control your program and get favorable results. 3. In this FITT Principle, if you are doing a split routine, like upper body at some point and lower body subsequent, your workouts are going to be more frequent than total body workouts. 4. In this FITT Principle, if you want to create strength, use heavyweights to try to do more sets with fewer repetitions for example, five sets of three repetitions each. 5. In this FITT Principle, if your goal is to develop muscle, do a higher number of sets with a moderate amount of repetitions (four sets of 10 to 12 reps each). 6. This principle differs depending on the health-related fitness component fargeted. 7.
