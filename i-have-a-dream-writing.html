In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

                        <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p><p>The “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr. before a crowd of some 250,000 people at the 1963 March on Washington, remains one of the most famous speeches in history. Weaving in references to the country’s Founding Fathers and the Bible, King used universal themes to depict the struggles of African Americans before closing with an improvised riff on his dreams of equality. The eloquent speech was immediately recognized as a highlight of the successful protest, and has endured as one of the signature moments of the </p><p>civil rights movement<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>EXCLAMATION</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>na check ko na to Tama po to sa.mga nagsasabi Ng mali ok lang kahit wag ninyo isagot</p><p></p><p></p><p>at Sana magustohan:)</p><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the finest explanations of American’s dream is the powerful speech of Martin Luther King, Jr. He delivered the speech at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, in Washington D.C. The speech is mainly centered on racial equality and stoppage of discrimination.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At that time, racial segregation ruled in almost all places: be it schools, neighborhoods and even in social places. With violence and riots so often, it was a disturbing moment for America although the U.S government was doing nothing to change the situation. Through the speech, Dr. King was educating inspiring and informing both the civil supporters and the unborn generation in the world to reach out to their dreams and giving his audience hope for a better future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Discussion</p><p></p><p>Up to the time when he was delivering the speech, African Americans were still under slavery from the white people as indicated in the below excerpt.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination…….One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land (Luther, 1963, para. 2).</p><p></p><p></p><p>The speech depicts the idea that someone can actually be anything that he dreams of becoming. Dr. King suggested that America is a land full of opportunities and that Americans should maximize on them. Before transforming the world, he saw the need to begin in America. Dr. King began the speech with a rhetoric phrase, ’Now is the time’, a tool that he used throughout speech. In the sixth paragraph of his speech, he used the phrase six times.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He was echoing to his audience to get hold of the moment. More so he used the phrase, ‘I have a dream eight times. By so doing he was echoing future hope for the people that will make them forget about all the slavery sufferings and injustices that they had faced while under slavery.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is a sign of hope for the future too. He brought in the idea of slavery to suggest that it is still operational in today’s world. By using the word ‘slave-owners’, Dr. King was referring to the white, however to calm any tension between the black and the white people, he re-unites them by saying, “… will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood” (Luther, 1963, para.12).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>&gt; While there is darkness &lt;I have a dream and that is to see a better world where poverty and child abuse aren't exist. Have you ever wondered how these people feel when they are suffering, hungry, and abused while people in high positions remain blind to the needs of its people? As i imagine the cries of the children begging to be saved, begging to be heard, and begging to have a life where they all deserved, i literally felt my heart ache and shattered in pieces. Why? I keep on asking why these people needs to feel that kind of misery? why our government didn't help them at all? is that because they can't bring power to them? or they can't bring the things that they want? But how? how can these people bring power to them if they need power to produce it? how can they manage to give the things that they want if these people can't even eat? how can they help if they are barely living? I just hope that someday these questions can be answered with a solution, i just wish that there will be someone who's powerful enough to encourage and open the eyes of other people and bring them to our reality. I just wish that there will be someone who can produce light and hope in this world, but today my only hope was God and you.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><p></p>ano yung mas gusto mong title?》"While there is darkness" or "close your eyes and darkness will consume you"?<p></p><p>p.s.
