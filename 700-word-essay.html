                        ANSWERA Promise Against Global Warming<p> Global Warming is an aspect of Climate Change it is the gradual increase in the earth's temperature generally due to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants. There are a few tasks humans can be given up to help in reducing the impact of climate change in my thoughts and opinions; <strong>Overfishing</strong> fish is one of the humans main resources due to the number of people consuming and buying fish much amount of marine life were reduced we can give up Overfishing since there are many much for foods we could it and use for our living such as farm animals like chicken and eating fruits and veggies, <strong>Deforestation</strong> we can also give up deforestation there are also some other items we could build-up without cutting our trees one of the examples is rock many people were now using rocks as paper, and last but not the least is <strong>Transport and Vehicles</strong> we could use some vehicles that do not have smokes so we could reduce the amount of pollution in our community. There are many ways to help and solve global warming one example is saving our energy at home, eating vegetables and fruits, and lastly using the 4RS which is Reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle could help us solve global warming.</p><p></p><p>My answer was based on my own opinion, some of them were from across the internet.</p><p></p><p>Happy Holidays! ^^</p><br />

                            5. Make an argumentative essay about this issue/topic: 500-700 words"Boy-girl having a relationship while studying"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In today's society, it is not uncommon for boys and girls to form relationships while studying. However, this issue has been the subject of much debate, with some people arguing that it can be a distraction from academics, while others believe that it can enhance a student's experience in school. In this essay, I will present both sides of the argument and provide my opinion on the matter.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, there are those who argue that having a relationship while studying can be a significant distraction from academics. They believe that students who are involved in romantic relationships tend to prioritize their significant others over their studies, leading to a decline in their grades. Additionally, students who are in relationships may spend more time socializing with their partners rather than studying, which can also have a negative impact on their academic performance. Furthermore, breakups can be emotionally draining and affect students' mental health, leading to even more significant distractions from their studies.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are those who argue that being in a relationship while studying can have a positive impact on a student's experience. They believe that relationships can provide emotional support and encouragement, which can help students overcome academic challenges. Moreover, being in a relationship can promote a sense of belonging and connection, which can lead to improved overall well-being and happiness. Additionally, being in a relationship can provide opportunities for students to learn important skills such as communication, compromise, and problem-solving, which can be valuable in both their personal and professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I believe that having a relationship while studying can be a positive experience as long as students can balance their academics and their romantic relationships. While it is true that being in a relationship can be a significant distraction, it is also true that students can find emotional support and motivation from their partners. As with any activity or commitment, it is important for students to learn how to manage their time effectively and prioritize their responsibilities. Students should strive to maintain a healthy balance between their academic and personal lives, which can lead to both academic success and personal fulfillment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, having a relationship while studying can be a contentious issue, with arguments for and against it. While it is true that relationships can be a distraction from academics, they can also provide emotional support and personal growth opportunities. Ultimately, it is up to individual students to manage their relationships in a way that balances their academic responsibilities and personal lives. With effective time management and prioritization, students can have a positive experience while maintaining their academic success.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

ESSAY 700 WORDS</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: AYAW NI BRAINLY PU TE K</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How can you contribute to your nation?</p><p></p><p>Well, I may show foreigners and tourists my country's magnificent islands, delicacies, and handcrafted items manufactured by our fellow citizens from my country. I can also contribute to the cleaning of our environment. I may not be able to clean my whole nation's filthy locations, but I can at least lessen the waste in my barangays. Right now, our home, the earth, is dying, and we must protect it and restore its health. It is possible that by safeguarding our earth, we may make our country healthy. There are several more ways a person might help rescue the world, such as planting more trees. Deforestation on a broad scale will be minimized if everyone plants a few trees instead of taking them down. This will enhance air quality and change the environment as a whole. Eat less meat, follow the 5Rs, save water and electricity, avoid burning plastics, understand garbage separation and disposal, disconnect unused electronics, and many other things. We must defend our planet since it is our only home. As a result, it must be protected from all dangers at all costs. God has given us the world as a gift. That is why it is our job to preserve and protect it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Welcome na lang</p><p>kung pede pa brainliest nman oh :)</p><br />

                        <p>The trend of boys and girls forming relationships while studying is rising in modern society, leading to a debate. Some contend that such relationships can divert students' focus from their academic goals, whereas others argue that they can enrich their experience in school.</p><p>One of the primary arguments against boy-girl relationships while studying is that they can serve as a distraction. A study conducted by Academia.edu showed that students in such relationships are often sidetracked by worrying about their partners, missing them during different classes, and spending less time studying. These factors can lead to lower grades, reduced motivation, and poor attendance. Furthermore, some relationships can be emotionally harmful or abusive, causing trauma and stress for the students involved. As such, some suggest that boy-girl relationships while studying can interfere with academic performance and overall well-being.</p><p>However, some argue that boy-girl relationships while studying can be beneficial. An article by Society19 suggests that being in a relationship in college can provide many advantages, such as emotional support, assistance with assignments, and shared interests and hobbies. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each year on April 22, people worldwide celebrate World Earth Day. It’s the day dedicated to protecting mother earth. People organize events, rallies, marches, concerts, and different projects to show their support for environmental protection. These activities aim to make the world aware of depleting conditions of our natural resources – land, air, water bodies, and forests.</p><p></p><p>Experts explain how human activities have led to the degradation of nature, why it’s dangerous to live in a polluted environment, and what actions they should take to prevent further damage and improve conditions.</p><p></p><p>The history of Earth Day goes back to the seventies. In the year 1970, people actually realized the grave conditions of our planet and began putting effort into protecting it. 1970 was the first year when Earth Day was celebrated. Millions of people were involved. People took to the streets, asking the government to take steps to protect nature. People from all walks of life gathered and pledged to take care of mother Earth. This way, they showed respect for mother nature and brought environmental problems to people’s attention.</p><p></p><p>US Senator Gaylord Nelson was the main inspiration behind the Earth Day event. Together with environmentalists, activists, students, and general masses, he demanded concrete action in defense of the environment. Moreover, he worked hard to take the problem to the political level.</p><p></p><p>Senator Nelson succeeded in his mission, and the first Earth Day garnered massive support from both government and common people. All people, wealthy, poor, sportsmen, businessmen, farmers, athletes, etc., took part in the event and committed to protecting Earth.</p><p>Earth is the only planet that supports life. It’s unique and the only place that we got. If we can’t protect it, it will endanger our own existence.</p><p></p><p>Life on Earth is dependent on several things. Land, water, soil, forests, air are all necessary for the survival of life on Earth. But rapid industrialization, unchecked consumption of natural resources, deforestation, pollution, climate changes, etc., has caused severe damage to the Earth’s ecosystem.</p><br />

                            13. explain your own philosophy in 700 words essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My philosophy on life is that you should live while you are alive and you should give others that same privilege. We shouldn’t judge people for the choices they make, because we all make bad decisions. You should do what you want with your life, as long as it makes you happy and causes no harm to others. Happiness is all we can hope for in this world and we have to strive to achieve it. We should help people when we can and graciously accept failures when we have to.</p><p> </p><p>The best way for people to live is to work hard and strive for success. People should be compassionate towards others and live life to the fullest. We have to make and maintain friendships. We have to try to advance in our careers and raise families. We have to try and help.</p><p></p><p>Being a good person means being a considerate person who thinks about the consequences of their decisions and the effects of their actions on others. Good people take care of themselves and their friends and try to make personal relationships a priority. Good people also tend to take the high road and be the bigger person in an argument. Generally, they will work to meet important deadlines and be helpful when they can. They try to succeed and take their work very seriously. They are good friends to others and try to treat everyone with respect.</p><p></p><p> Good people aren’t always moral people. This is because moral people seem to be more concerned with rules and laws and are sure to follow them. Good people, in my opinion, do what they think they must to do what is right.</p><p></p><p>Having confidence helps us to live life without conflict. If we are positive and avoid the negative attitude from our mind, we feel more confident than while thinking negatively. The way of avoiding the negative attitude is to think about our strengths and our capacity that we can do, our accomplishments and the success story that we have achieved so far. We have to give value to our hard work and have to learn to respect ourselves. Procrastination is an enemy of positive thinking, rather than just keeping this in mind let’s practice in our real life by talking with people about positive thinking and its impact on everyday life.…</p><p></p><p>Everyone has a passion in life, and giving one’s possession to come out is helpful for boosting the confidence level. We have to follow the golden rule of life which says we are human beings and we might fail several times but we will keep on doing and moving forward. Having confidence in life directs toward perfection life will be more exciting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Your own self-belief is far more important and beneficial to your well-being than having to rely on positive reinforcement from others to validate your own self-worth. NEVER STOP BELIEVING IN YOURSELF When things in your life are not going the way you would like or are not happening the way you had envisioned or planned, your self-belief will start to diminish. To regain your self-belief so you can start believing in yourself again and what you are capable of achieving, you must be able to set realistic goals for yourself that you will be able to achieve. Your self-belief grows with every accomplishment and goal that you achieve and that is why it is important to set goals for yourself that are attainable.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Evolution is the process in which organisms descend from ancestors. Evolution is responsible for some of the various similarities seen through biological life, and it also explains all of the diversity in organisms and species. There are various components of evolution: descent, mutation, natural selection, genetic variation, genetic drift and coevolution. All of these components are extremely fundamental to evolution because Darwin's theory of evolution states that all species and organisms have arisen and developed due to material stemming from natural selection of petite inherited variations that can increase the ability for said organism to survive, reproduce, etc. This theory states that the changes that have occurred through mutation is beneficial, harmful, or neutral. If changes in an organisms DNA is harmful then the odds of that organism surviving/reproducing/ etc is unlikely. Some may think of this concept as survival of the fittest. Mutations tend to make the evolution process speed up which means that new genes are added to a species' gene pool. This is beneficial to an extent when it comes to organisms that have many dangerous genes and factors that can cause their offspring to mutate and continue to reproduce organisms with less than mutations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication, as they allow individuals to share information, ideas, and opinions in a clear and concise manner. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why oral presentations are so important for work purposes is that they help individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively. Unlike written communication, which can be misinterpreted or misunderstood, oral presentations allow individuals to use their voice, tone, and body language to convey their message in a more impactful way. This is particularly important in situations where there is a lot of information to convey or where the topic may be complex or technical.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why oral presentations are critical for workplace communication is that they allow individuals to engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way. Whether it is a one-on-one presentation or a large group presentation, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to build relationships and connect with their audience on a deeper level. This can help to build trust, establish credibility, and ultimately, achieve the desired outcome of the presentation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to building relationships, oral presentations also help to inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace. Whether it is a motivational speech, a team-building exercise, or a training session, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to inspire and motivate their audience to achieve their goals. This is particularly important in a work environment where individuals may be facing challenges or obstacles, as it can help to boost morale and create a more positive and productive work environment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, oral presentations are a critical tool for effective leadership in the workplace. Whether it is leading a team meeting or presenting a strategic plan, oral presentations provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision, goals, and expectations in a clear and concise manner. This can help to inspire and motivate their team, build trust and credibility, and ultimately, achieve success in their respective roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, oral presentations are important for workplace communication because they help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Oral presentations require individuals to be confident, articulate, and organized, which are all essential skills for effective communication in the workplace. By regularly presenting in front of an audience, individuals can develop these skills and become more effective communicators, which can ultimately help them to advance in their careers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication. They allow individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively, engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way, inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace, provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision and goals, and help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace. Therefore, it is important for individuals to invest time and effort in developing their oral presentation skills, as it can ultimately help them to achieve success in their respective roles and advance in their careers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana Po Maka tulong </p><br />

                            29. [essay; max of 700 words]How important is biodiversity and in what ways can you preserve it?</h2><br />
                        The variety of life on Earth, its biological diversity is commonly referred to as biodiversity.<br /><br />The number of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, the enormous diversity of genes in these species, the different ecosystems on the planet, such as deserts, rainforests and coral reefs are all part of a biologically diverse Earth.<br /><br />1. Help Native Pollinators. Pollinators, are the key to reproduction for most flowering plants which are foundational to the survival of many species on our planet. This is why the criteria of Biodiversity Hotspots gives so much weight to the number of plants in an area. Give pollinators an extra boost in your backyard by: reducing or eliminating the use of pesticides, providing nectar sources by planting a variety of wildflowers and native plants that will bloom throughout the season, leaving logs and rocks in your yard or build bee boxes for native bees to make their home, encouraging your City to stop weed-whacking median strips and sidewalk edges and let native wildflowers grow to create pollinator corridors.<br /><br />2. Reduce or eliminate pesticides and fertilizer. Consider getting rid of your lawn, especially if you live in an arid region. Instead, plant native plants that are well adapted to your area. This will reduce the need to use pesticides and fertilizers. Don’t buy plants from nurseries that use systemic pesticides such as neonictinoids. When applied, they persist in all parts of the plant from the seed to the stem to the blossom and reek havoc on already stressed pollinators.<br /><br />3. Restore habitat in your yard. If you have a yard, consider turning it into a mini-wildlife sanctuary. National Wildlife Federation has a program to help you attract wildlife whether you have a balcony or a 20-acre farm. In a world where habitat loss is the number one cause of biodiversity loss, providing wildlife with water, food, cover, and a place to raise their young can go a long way.<br /><br />4. Restore habitat in your community. If you don’t have a yard, consider volunteering on an ecological restoration project in your area. Good places to look for volunteer opportunities are land trusts, wildlife foundations, Native Plant Societies, government agencies (e.g. Forest Service, Fish &amp; Wildlife), and environmental organizations. You’ll spend time outdoors and learn about the native plants and animals.<br /><br />5. Reduce your consumption. This is arguably the action that will have the biggest positive impact on the environment. The more we reduce our demand for new resources, the less habitat will be destroyed to get those resources or the energy to make those products, and the less waste goes into the landfill. Become a minimalist. Most “minimalists” choose to live a simple life to free up their time to do the things they love rather than spending time shopping and repairing stuff. The idea is “Own Less, Live More.” But it’s undeniable that the minimalist lifestyle also greatly benefits the environment.<br /><br />6. Reuse and recycle. Composting is key here. It reduces the amount of waste going into landfills and the space needed to hold that waste. Look into ways you can use those purchases intended for single-use. Keep up with what is recyclable in your area. As new markets for recycled products open up, even small towns like mine can increase the numbers of items that they are able to collect.<br /><br />7. Reduce your energy demand. Burning fossil fuels is the number one driver of climate change which is exponentially quickening biodiversity loss by presenting unparalleled challenges to the world’s plants and animals. Start by conserving energy in your home. A Home Energy Audit can help raise your awareness about where you can reduce energy use in your home. Then incorporate renewable energy. Solar,<br /><br />8. Buy local foods. Buying from your local farmer at a farmer’s market or through a farm stand gives you the ability to find out how your food was grown and make requests for different practices such as no pesticides, or a greater diversity of produce. It’s easier to ask someone you have a relationship with to change their practices than a big corporation.<br /><br />9. Buy organic foods. While organic certification doesn’t guarantee that your food is 100% free of pesticides, organic growers are held to criteria of minimal pesticide use.<br /><br />10. Donate to conservation efforts.Species extinction is happening at an unprecedented rate and there never seems to be enough money to save everything. <br /><br />11. Advocate for Biodiversity.<br /><br />Educate yourself about the importance of biodiversity.<br /><br />
