Joseph was next to the youngest son. The father lovedJoseph more than his other children and gave him a beautiful, colorful robe.Joseph's brothers did not like him. One day they sold Joseph to a caravan of peoplegoing to Egypt. But God was with Joseph. There he was sold to Potiphar, captain of theking's guard. He took care of Potiphar's home and all his belongings. One day Potiphar'swife told a lie about Joseph and he was put into prison. God was still with Joseph, takingcare of him and protecting him.In prison the guard found favor in Joseph and put him in charge of all the prisoners.Two prisoners, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker, had dreams, Joseph told themwhat they meant. Soon afterwards the cup bearer went back to work for the king.Two years later the king of Egypt had two dreams and he was sad, because he didnot know what the dreams meant. The cup bearer told the king about Joseph and he wasbrought to the palace. With God's help, Joseph told the king what the dreams meant.There would be seven years when there would be lots of crops and food. Afterwards therewould be seven years of drought, with little rain and very little food.The king put Joseph in charge, second-in-command of Egypt. Joseph helped takecare of the country. He had the people store and save food during the prosperous years,when there was lots of food. This way the people could buy food during drought years,when little food could be grown.One day his brothers came to Egypt to buy food and Joseph gave them food. Whenthey found out that he was their brother, they asked him to forgive them for the wrong thingsthat they had done against him. He forgave them. He invited his whole family to come livein Egypt where he could help take care of them. Joseph was happy to be together againand to see his father again.Joseph told his family that God was always with him, helping to take care of his life.PART 1: PERSONAL QUESTIONSWhat did you learn from the story?1.2.How can you apply this story to your life?Page 1​</a>

Joseph was next to the youngest son. The father lovedJoseph more than his other children and gave him a beautiful, colorful robe.Joseph's brothers did not like him. One day they sold Joseph to a caravan of peoplegoing to Egypt. But God was with Joseph. There he was sold to Potiphar, captain of theking's guard. He took care of Potiphar's home and all his belongings. One day Potiphar'swife told a lie about Joseph and he was put into prison. God was still with Joseph, takingcare of him and protecting him.In prison the guard found favor in Joseph and put him in charge of all the prisoners.Two prisoners, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker, had dreams, Joseph told themwhat they meant. Soon afterwards the cup bearer went back to work for the king.Two years later the king of Egypt had two dreams and he was sad, because he didnot know what the dreams meant. The cup bearer told the king about Joseph and he wasbrought to the palace. With God's help, Joseph told the king what the dreams meant.There would be seven years when there would be lots of crops and food. Afterwards therewould be seven years of drought, with little rain and very little food.The king put Joseph in charge, second-in-command of Egypt. Joseph helped takecare of the country. He had the people store and save food during the prosperous years,when there was lots of food. This way the people could buy food during drought years,when little food could be grown.One day his brothers came to Egypt to buy food and Joseph gave them food. Whenthey found out that he was their brother, they asked him to forgive them for the wrong thingsthat they had done against him. He forgave them. He invited his whole family to come livein Egypt where he could help take care of them.
