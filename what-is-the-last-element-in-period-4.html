Write the correct letter on the space provided before the number. a.Plotb.Characterc.Settingd.Point of viewe.Conflictf.Rising Actiong.Resolutionh.Climaxi.Expositionj.Falling Action____ 1. A piece of literature has to have at least one character, which can be a person, an object, or an animal.____ 2. It is defined as the sequence of events that occurs from the first line to the last.____ 3. The central struggle that motivates the characters and leads to the climax. ____ 4. This is the "peak" of the plot where all the tension of the rising action finally comes to a head, the characters finally have to face and solve the major conflict.____ 5. This is the very beginning of a story. During the beginning, authors usually introduce the major characters and settings to the reader.____ 6. It is the time and location where the story takes place, the periods, geographic locations, cultural contexts, immediate surroundings, weather, times of day, or times of year in the story.____ 7. It is literally everything that happens in a story that leads up to the climax of the plot.____ 8. It is everything that happens after the book's climax but before the resolution. This is where writers tie up any loose ends and start bringing the book's action to a close.____ 9. It is the position of the narrator in relationship to the plot of a piece of literature, it is the perspective from which the story is told.____10. This is the conclusion of a story. But just because it's called conclusion, doesn't mean every single issue is resolved happily—or even satisfactorily. ​</a>

What do you call the vertical columns in the periodic table? How about the horizontal rows? ______________________________________________ 2. In what side of the periodic table are metals found? How about the nonmetals? ______________________________________________ 3.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1.The vertical columns are called groups or families because of their similar chemical behaviour. Meanwhile elements in horizontal rows are called periods.</p><p></p><p>2.Metals are located on the left of the periodic table, and nonmetals are located on the upper right.</p><p></p><p>3.Elements with the same number of electrons in their outermost shell show similar chemical properties. For Example, Helium (with its 2), neon, argon, and krypton (each with 8) have "filled" their outermost shells. They are the so-called inert or "noble" gases. They have no chemistry at all.</p><p></p><p>4.The number of electrons in the outermost shell of a particular atom determines its reactivity, or tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms. This outermost shell is known as the valence shell, and the electrons found in it are called valence electrons.</p><p></p><p>5. They are called valence electrons.</p><br />

The growth during adolescence creates decreased demand for energy and nutrients.2. As an adolescent, your total nutrient needs are lower at this stage than at any other stage in your lifecycle.3.Due to your rapid growth and development at this stage, you have a greater need for certain nutrients, such ascalcium, iron, protein, and energy foods.4. Adolescence is one of the slowest growth periods in a person's life.5. Good dietary guidance has three important elements: pyramids, plates and real food.6. Healthy eating is important for proper growth and development.7. Eating a wide variety of foods in moderation daily is a good practice.8. Following the Food Guide Pyramid and the Nutritional guidelines for Filipinos will make it easier for anyone tohave a balanced diet daily.9. Two (2) tablespoons (Tbsp) is about 2 times the size of the tip of your thumb (from the last crease).10. Adolescents can achieve their energy and nutrient requirements by eating a variety of foods daily.11. Skipping meal will keep the body fueled by energy needed for the day.12. Too much sweets and dessert can aggravate skin problems like pimples.13. The Food Guide Pyramid will guide you on how many servings from each food group is recommended daily.14. There are six food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid.15. The serving requirements of each individual depend on age, sex, size, and activity level.​</h2><br />

It is defined as the sequence of events that occurs from the first line to the last.____ 3. The central struggle that motivates the characters and leads to the climax. ____ 4. This is the "peak" of the plot where all the tension of the rising action finally comes to a head, the characters finally have to face and solve the major conflict.____ 5. This is the very beginning of a story. During the beginning, authors usually introduce the major characters and settings to the reader.____ 6. It is the time and location where the story takes place, the periods, geographic locations, cultural contexts, immediate surroundings, weather, times of day, or times of year in the story.____ 7. It is literally everything that happens in a story that leads up to the climax of the plot.____ 8. It is everything that happens after the book's climax but before the resolution. This is where writers tie up any loose ends and start bringing the book's action to a close.____ 9. It is the position of the narrator in relationship to the plot of a piece of literature, it is the perspective from which the story is told.____10. This is the conclusion of a story. But just because it's called conclusion, doesn't mean every single issue is resolved happily—or even satisfactorily. ​</h2><br />
