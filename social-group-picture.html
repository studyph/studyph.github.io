Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yan lang</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.If we are in public and cannot maintain six feet of social distance between ourselves and others, then it is important that we wear a mask to slow the spread of coronavirus.21 Jul 2020</p><p>2.Follow the rules the government had Given</p><p>3.Even “nutritious” cereal choices, such as granola that contain oats, are often loaded with sugar.

                            30. Write a paragraph about the cause-and-effects of COVID-19. Use the details below and write them in correct format. Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>    We investigate the relationship between media consumption, misinformation, and important attitudes and behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We find that comparatively more misinformation circulates on Twitter, while news media tends to reinforce public health recommendations like social distancing. We find that exposure to social media is associated with misperceptions regarding basic facts about COVID-19 while the inverse is true for news media. These misperceptions are in turn associated with lower compliance with social distancing measures. We thus draw a clear link from misinformation circulating on social media, notably Twitter, to behaviours and attitudes that potentially magnify the scale and lethality of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kapag tama paki BRAINLIEST po</p><br />
