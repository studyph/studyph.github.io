                        <p><strong>An explanation of i-it relationship and i-you relationship.</strong></p><p></p><p>Just in case you never heard of<strong> i-it relationship </strong>and <strong>i-you relationship</strong>, then I will explain them to you in this thread. In English, if we want to express or point an inanimate object or animals or plants, we use it to refer to them, regardless of the genders. Surely you must have noticed about the use of she and he to refer to male or female human beings, and here, it is just the third variation.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the<strong> i-you relationship </strong>is between a subject of I with you as other subject of the same position. Usually, the relationship of i-you is used in <strong>direct speech </strong>since it also indicates that the subject I is talking directly with the other subject or, in this case, the "you". </p><p></p><p>A simple example would be: I reach down to my feet to take my pencil on the floor. It fell five minutes earlier. As you can see, it is used to replace the pencil, so in this case the i-it relationship is pretty clear. As for the example of i-you: Haven't I told you about the football match last week?</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the topic of i-it relationship </strong>by referring to https://brainly.ph/question/9973293</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe that courtship is necessary for building a relationship because it's the most fundamental part when you plan to enter into a romantic relationship with someone. Trust is the foundation in every aspect. When you're making friends, you need to know their intention first. It's the same as when you have an intimate relationship.
