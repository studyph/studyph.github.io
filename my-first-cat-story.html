                                            My Thai CatBy Pratoomratha ZengA Siamese cat was given by a friend of Zeng's father. Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</a>

It was beginning to get dark. We were still not home yet. I bet Dad was going to be mad at us, I thought. I yelled at my brother to ride his bike faster, but it was difficult to ride bikes uphill. I was so tired that every muscle in my legs was burning. My brother finally got off his bike and sat down. I stopped and went back
to help him. Suddenly, there was a car coming toward us. I could see headlights. It was Dad. He had come to look for us, since we were so late getting home. I knew I was going to get into trouble, but at least we were safe. Dad picked us up and took us home

March 2nd was a great day at the New York Public Library More than 250 first and second graders wore red-and-white-striped stovepipe hats. They were celebrating The Cat in the Hars 50th birthday. Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat picture book has been published for 50 years now. The famous feline danced with children racing around him. At the same time, pink, purple, and white confetti rained down.
Serena Williams, the tennis champion, read The Cat in the Hat to second graders. They sat on brightly-colored rugs around her. Two lucky second graders from PS 152 in Manhattan sat next to Williams on a big red chair. Pink and purple umbrellas hung from the ceiling. The students giggled while Williams made her voice change from deep to high for the many characters in the story.

                                            Compare and Contrast the following. Read first the story. ◾The Travelers and the SeaTwo Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves."Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!"The object they saw came ever nearer the shore."No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish."Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore."It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.Lesson Learned: Do not let your hopes carry you away from reality.◾The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.￼The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella."You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."Lesson Learned: Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.​​</a>

His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded.

Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</h2><br />

It was beginning to get dark. We were still not home yet. I bet Dad was going to be mad at us, I thought. I yelled at my brother to ride his bike faster, but it was difficult to ride bikes uphill. I was so tired that every muscle in my legs was burning. My brother finally got off his bike and sat down. I stopped and went back
to help him. Suddenly, there was a car coming toward us. I could see headlights. It was Dad. He had come to look for us, since we were so late getting home. I knew I was going to get into trouble, but at least we were safe. Dad picked us up and took us home

                            9. Compare and Contrast the following. Read first the story. ◾The Travelers and the SeaTwo Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves."Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!"The object they saw came ever nearer the shore."No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish."Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore."It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.Lesson Learned: Do not let your hopes carry you away from reality.◾The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.￼The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella."You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."Lesson Learned: Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>Here are the differences and similarities about the stories entitled " ◾The Travelers and the Sea" and "The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse".</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>SIMILARITIES<p>- Both stories tell us that happiness lies in our hands.  It also tells us that we should appreciate whatever we have and be grateful because it will lead us to the essence of happiness in life</p><p></p><p>    2.

Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />
