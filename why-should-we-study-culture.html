                                            Ask most people which day of the week they fear the most and the answer is likely to be Monday. The first day of the working week can make us depressed. (1)_____ The most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January, when it's cold and dark outside. This day was named "Blue Monday" by psychologist Cliff Arnall. Even if there was little science behind Blue Monday, it's probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning means the coming of a new working week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun. (2)______It's what psychologists call an emotional shift, and no other part of the week has a transition like it. Apparently, Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins. (3)_____According to a website, "If you can't stand your job, then the Monday blues can be very real." And it can be especially difficult to start another seemingly endless workweek. Your case of the Mondays can have a negative impact on your performance, productivity and the people around you. (4)______ Feeling a bit low shouldn't be confused with more serious depression, caused by other factors. Claudia Hammond, an author and presenter, argues that this low feeling might be untrue. (5)_____She mentions an Australian study of how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays. So, when Monday comes, maybe we should give it a second chance! A. But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is? B. What exactly makes us feel down remains unknown. C. Weekends are definitely happy days in all countries. D. That's why the feeling is described as the Monday blues. E. There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays. F. Our Monday mood can be based on a direct comparison to the day before. G. It's back to the routine and the realization that there are five days of working ahead.​</a>

                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

                            11. Ask most people which day of the week they fear the most and the answer is likely to be Monday. The first day of the working week can make us depressed. (1)_____ The most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January, when it's cold and dark outside. This day was named "Blue Monday" by psychologist Cliff Arnall. Even if there was little science behind Blue Monday, it's probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning means the coming of a new working week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun. (2)______It's what psychologists call an emotional shift, and no other part of the week has a transition like it. Apparently, Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins. (3)_____According to a website, "If you can't stand your job, then the Monday blues can be very real." And it can be especially difficult to start another seemingly endless workweek. Your case of the Mondays can have a negative impact on your performance, productivity and the people around you. (4)______ Feeling a bit low shouldn't be confused with more serious depression, caused by other factors. Claudia Hammond, an author and presenter, argues that this low feeling might be untrue. (5)_____She mentions an Australian study of how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays. So, when Monday comes, maybe we should give it a second chance! A. But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is? B. What exactly makes us feel down remains unknown. C. Weekends are definitely happy days in all countries. D. That's why the feeling is described as the Monday blues. E. There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays. F. Our Monday mood can be based on a direct comparison to the day before. G. It's back to the routine and the realization that there are five days of working ahead.​</h2><br />

                            18. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

                            21. 1.What is ethics? What are the reasons why we should study Ethics?ANSWER:      Ethics are serve as a guide  to every individual  person’s behavior. It is shaped by social norms, cultural practices, and religious influences.Ethics tells us what to aspire to and also constrains our actions.Ethics reflect beliefs about what is right, what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust, what is good, and what is bad in terms of human behavior. They serve as a compass to direct how people should behave toward each other, understand and fulfill their obligations to society, and live their lives.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ethics is the process of questioning, discovering and defending our values, principles and purpose. It’s about finding out who we are and staying true to that in the face of temptations, challenges and uncertainty. It’s not always fun and it’s hardly ever easy, but if we commit to it, we set ourselves up to make decisions we can stand by, building a life that’s truly our own and a future we want to be a part of.</p><br />
