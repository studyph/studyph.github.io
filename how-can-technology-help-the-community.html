                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Due to this pandemic, people won't be able to see their friends in personal, that's why they are using cellphones or their computer to communicate with them.

                            3. How can you help shape science and technology in your school and in the community</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.</p><p>What is important is to cultivate the scientific methodology: how we know what we know and how to improve upon it.</p><p>If School Science is force-fed to kids as volumes of “unalterable facts” for memorization, or the teachers are not engaging in order to fuel the natural curiosity of their pupils to seek Science outside of the school books and the mundane assignments, it will be harder to inspire the precious 5–10% of the people that could actually engage Science in their professional careers, or the 1% that could actually seriously help with the next “breakthrough”.</p><p>All kids need to be exposed to scientific thinking. You cannot expect that the “right” minds will be self-interested and pursue it by themselves, or that the parents that are “proud of their little genius” and push to that direction are correct or even do it in a proper way.</p><p>The very fact that his question needs to be asked as if there is a doubt that the future of a country that prides itself being in the forefront of technological innovation is compromised by scientific illiteracy even at very early stages, is telling.</p><p>In the short-term, we should re-evaluate why great engineering career positions are filled to a high % by foreigners. They don’t “steal jobs”, the locals forfeited a long time ago.</p><p></p><br />

The authors note that the rapid growth of e-commerce and freight fleet management systems make it difficult to arrive at firm, statistics-based conclusions about their impact on road freight transportation, but suggest that more sophisticated government management of transportation demand as well as freight fleet management systems could cancel out the negative impact of e-commerce on road transportation.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Located on the southern shores of Manila Bay and southwest of Metro Manila, it is one of the most industrialized and fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines. 2.For Filipinos, traditions in their home and in their family are important.
