                        Simple and Maturity Value<p><strong>Simple interest </strong>is calculated on the principal portion of a loan or the original contribution to a savings account. Simple Interest is calculated using the following formula: SI = P × R × T. <strong>Maturity value</strong> is the amount due and payable to the holder of a financial obligation as of the maturity date of the obligation. Refers to the remaining principal balance on a loan or bond. <strong>Maturity value</strong> is the same as par value.</p>Answers:₱3,450          7 years      ₱50012%9%₱5,040₱8,050₱17,388₱7,404.444%Solutions:<p>1.
