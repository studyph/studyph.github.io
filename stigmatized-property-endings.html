                                            Make a ReflectionSituation 5: Is same sex marriage also known as gay marriage ethical or moral?Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender. As of 2022, marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 33 countries. Scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against gay and lesbian people, with research also repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals.Pa help po ​</a>

WE ARE NOT THE VIRUS "Health workers speak to UNICEF about                                    their struggles'     by Jacques Gimeno (May 19, 2020) When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Philippines in early March, people started looking for answers. In a country that has faced disease outbreaks, the sight of doctors and nurses aiding the sick is comforting to many. It came as a surprise when some people started to turn against frontline health workers shortly after the lockdown in mid-March. Reports of health workers being attacked became news, with many experiencing eviction, ridicule, and harassment. Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.​</a>

                                            https://philnews.ph/2Activity 5: Read the passage carefully. Identify what positive and negative messages canbe drawn from the text.WORDS MATTER: When talking about coronavirus disease, certain words (i.e. suspect case,isolation...) and language may have a negative meaning for people and fuel stigmatizingattitudes. They can perpetuate existing negative stereotypes a assumptions, strengthen falseassociations between the disease and other factors, create widespread fear, or dehumanizethose who have the disease. This can drive people away from getting screened, tested andquarantined. We recommend a people firs, language that respects and empowers people inall communication channels, including the media. Words used in media are especiallyimportant because these will shape the popular language and communication on the newcoronavirus (COVID-19). Negative reporting has the potential to influence how peoplesuspected to have the new coronavirus (COVID-19), patients and their families and affectedcommunities are perceived and treated. There are many concrete examples of how the useof inclusive language and less stigmatizing terminology can help to in control epidemics andpandemics from the HIV, TB and H1N1 Flu 2​</a>

Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.It’s lonely in the front lineOne of the first to provide support as COVID-19 broke, UNICEF responded to requests from the Department of Health (DOH) and delivered tents to hospitals to help manage the triage and isolation of suspected cases and to increase the overall capacity for the response.At Sta. Ana Hospital in the capital Manila, one of the government-run hospitals that received a UNICEF tent, the medical staff say they’re fortunate because the management provides living quarters and meals.Being in the front line exposes them to immediate risks, so they’ve come to rely on each other.But when they find themselves alone at times, fear gets to them and hits the hardest during end of shift.“We face an internal struggle at the end of the day,” says Jose Karganilla, a 32-year-old nurse. “What if I get sick? I’m on my own.”His colleague and friend, Patrick Tan, 31, believes the pandemic makes some of them question why they do what they do. “Some of us struggle to accept that we’re risking our lives,” he says as he weighs his next words. “We’re working with one foot in the grave.”Sanita Uy-Vistal, a laboratory scientist, praises her colleagues in the front line. But she sometimes wishes they could get support, too.“People always see doctors and nurses. They don’t see the lab scientistbehind all this,” Sanita says. “We handle the specimen for testing which exposes us to a greater risk.”​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. When you're addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes.</p><p>Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a friend or relative who has been prescribed the medication.</p><p>The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.</p><p>As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms).</p><p>You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>Symptoms</p><p>Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day</p><p>Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts</p><p>Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect</p><p>Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended</p><p>Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug</p><p>Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it</p><p>Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use</p><p>Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm</p><p>Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing</p><p>Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug</p><p>Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug</p><p>Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug</p><p>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HOPE ITS HELP<strong>MAKE </strong><strong>ME </strong><strong>BRAINLIST</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>HIV stigma is negative attitudes and beliefs about people with HIV. It is the prejudice that comes with labeling an individual as part of a group that is believed to be socially unacceptable.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are a few examples:
</p><p>
</p><p>Believing that only certain groups of people can get HIV
</p><p>Making moral judgments about people who take steps to prevent HIV transmission
</p><p>Feeling that people deserve to get HIV because of their choices.                                                    K SERIES MOBILE CRUSHING &amp; SCREENING PLANT is researched to meet customers’ demand on high quality and high output, compared with fixed crushing line of equal power or old mobile plant, it is of more reliable performance stability, more complete function and higher practicability.

                            7. Make a ReflectionSituation 5: Is same sex marriage also known as gay marriage ethical or moral?Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender. As of 2022, marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 33 countries. Scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. Social science research indicates that the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against gay and lesbian people, with research also repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals.Pa help po ​</h2><br />
                        Reflection: This situation of same-sex marriage is a very sensitive and controversial issue that has been a part of society for a long time. After researching and analyzing the facts, it can be concluded that same-sex marriage is ethical and moral because it provides benefits to same-sex couples and their children. It also shows that by excluding same-sex couples from marriage, it can create a lot of discrimination which is unfair. After reflecting on this situation, I believe that same-sex marriage should be accepted and respected by society. <br /><br />I hope it's help : ) <br />

                            25. https://philnews.ph/2Activity 5: Read the passage carefully. Identify what positive and negative messages canbe drawn from the text.WORDS MATTER: When talking about coronavirus disease, certain words (i.e. suspect case,isolation...) and language may have a negative meaning for people and fuel stigmatizingattitudes. They can perpetuate existing negative stereotypes a assumptions, strengthen falseassociations between the disease and other factors, create widespread fear, or dehumanizethose who have the disease. This can drive people away from getting screened, tested andquarantined. We recommend a people firs, language that respects and empowers people inall communication channels, including the media. Words used in media are especiallyimportant because these will shape the popular language and communication on the newcoronavirus (COVID-19). Negative reporting has the potential to influence how peoplesuspected to have the new coronavirus (COVID-19), patients and their families and affectedcommunities are perceived and treated. There are many concrete examples of how the useof inclusive language and less stigmatizing terminology can help to in control epidemics andpandemics from the HIV, TB and H1N1 Flu 2​</h2><br />

                            30. PLEASE HELP ME TO ANSWER MY LEARNING TASK. THANKSWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Philippines in early March, people started looking for answers.In a country that has faced disease outbreaks, the sight of doctors and nurses aiding the sick is comforting to many. It came as a surprise when some people started to turn against frontline health workers shortly after the lockdown in mid-March.Reports of health workers being attacked became news, with many experiencing eviction, ridicule, and harassment. Despite public adulation for their heroic sacrifices, frontline health workers fear for their lives as the risk of stigmatization weighs almost as heavy as their exposure to the virus.It’s lonely in the front lineOne of the first to provide support as COVID-19 broke, UNICEF responded to requests from the Department of Health (DOH) and delivered tents to hospitals to help manage the triage and isolation of suspected cases and to increase the overall capacity for the response.At Sta. Ana Hospital in the capital Manila, one of the government-run hospitals that received a UNICEF tent, the medical staff say they’re fortunate because the management provides living quarters and meals.Being in the front line exposes them to immediate risks, so they’ve come to rely on each other.But when they find themselves alone at times, fear gets to them and hits the hardest during end of shift.“We face an internal struggle at the end of the day,” says Jose Karganilla, a 32-year-old nurse. “What if I get sick? I’m on my own.”His colleague and friend, Patrick Tan, 31, believes the pandemic makes some of them question why they do what they do. “Some of us struggle to accept that we’re risking our lives,” he says as he weighs his next words. “We’re working with one foot in the grave.”Sanita Uy-Vistal, a laboratory scientist, praises her colleagues in the front line. But she sometimes wishes they could get support, too.“People always see doctors and nurses. They don’t see the lab scientistbehind all this,” Sanita says. “We handle the specimen for testing which exposes us to a greater risk.”​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	What does the article say about the medical front liner’s situation in the country?
</p><p>- The article says that front liners are not given enough value and appreciation that they truly deserve. Often times they are being ridiculed by many instead of being appreciated. </p><p>
</p><p>2.How can the situation influence the Filipino medical front liners
</p><p>- The situation builds fear to our Filipino medical front liners and at the same time it makes them reflect about the essence of the job and field that they have chosen. They already know that to save lives they must also risk their own.</p><p>
</p><p>3. How should this situation be addressed?
</p><p>- This situation must be addressed by the government through spreading awareness to everyone to stay at home because by saving our lives we are also keeping our medical workers safe. Our government must also give their 100% support in all aspects. </p><p>
</p><p>4. What Filipino values can be gained from the given text?
</p><p>- This shows that Filipinos are resilient because we are able to withstand all the tragedy, struggles and problems. It also shows that Filipinos are courageous because amidst fear, we always choose to go further.
