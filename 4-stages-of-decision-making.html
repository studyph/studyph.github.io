                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Psychoanalysis is a psychological theory and therapy that aims to treat mental disorders by exploring the unconscious mind. Its major theorists include Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Jacques Lacan.</p><p></p><p>Sigmund Freud: He is considered the father of psychoanalysis. He developed the theory of the unconscious mind and the concept of the Oedipus complex.</p><p></p><p>Carl Jung: He was a Swiss psychiatrist who developed analytical psychology. He introduced the concept of the collective unconscious and archetypes.</p><p></p><p>Jacques Lacan: He was a French psychoanalyst who developed the idea of the unconscious as structured like a language. He also emphasized the importance of the symbolic order in human experience.</p><p></p><p>Rational Choice Theory is a social theory that explains human behavior as the result of rational decision-making. Its major theorists include Kenneth Arrow, Anthony Downs, and James Buchanan.</p><p></p><p>Kenneth Arrow: He was an American economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1972. He developed the Arrow's impossibility theorem, which shows the impossibility of creating a perfect voting system.</p><p></p><p>Anthony Downs: He was an American political scientist who developed the theory of rational choice in politics. He argued that voters and politicians act rationally to maximize their own interests.</p><p></p><p>James Buchanan: He was an American economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986. He developed the public choice theory, which applies the principles of rational choice theory to the study of politics and public policy.</p><p></p><p>Institutionalism is a social theory that explains human behavior as the result of social institutions and norms. Its major theorists include John R. Commons, Thorstein Veblen, and Douglass North.</p><p></p><p>John R. Commons: He was an American economist who developed the institutional economics theory. He argued that institutions shape economic behavior and that economic development is the result of institutional change.</p><p></p><p>Thorstein Veblen: He was an American economist who developed the theory of conspicuous consumption. He argued that people consume goods and services as a way to display their social status.</p><p></p><p>Douglass North: He was an American economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1993. He developed the new institutional economics theory, which explains economic behavior as the result of institutions and transaction costs.</p><p></p><p>Freud's Five Stages of Psychosexual Development are: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. Each stage is characterized by a different focus of pleasure and conflict.</p><p></p><p>Three Levels of Awareness are: conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. Consciousness is the level of awareness that includes all thoughts and feelings that a person is currently aware of. Preconsciousness includes thoughts and feelings that can be easily brought to consciousness. Unconsciousness includes thoughts and feelings that are not accessible to consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Three Provinces of Mind are: id, ego, and superego. Id is the part of the mind that is responsible for instinctual drives and desires. Ego is the part of the mind that mediates between the id and the external world. Superego is the part of the mind that represents the internalized moral standards of society.</p><p></p><p>Types of Defense Mechanisms are: repression, denial, projection, displacement, regression, rationalization, sublimation, and reaction formation. These are unconscious psychological mechanisms that people use to cope with anxiety and stress.</p><p></p><p>The basic assumptions of rational choice theory are that individuals are rational, self-interested, and goal-oriented. Cost-benefit analysis is a decision-making process that involves weighing the costs and benefits of different options to determine the best course of action.</p><p></p><p>The types of institutionalism are: historical institutionalism, sociological institutionalism, and rational choice institutionalism. Historical institutionalism emphasizes the role of historical legacies and path dependence in shaping institutions. Sociological institutionalism emphasizes the role of social norms and cultural values in shaping institutions. Rational choice institutionalism emphasizes the role of individual actors and strategic behavior in shaping institutions.</p><p></p><p>However, I can say that learning about Psychoanalysis, Rational Choice Theory, and Institutionalism can provide a deeper understanding of human behavior and social phenomena. These theories offer different perspectives and approaches to explain how individuals and institutions operate, and how they affect society as a whole. By studying these theories, we can gain insights into the complexities of human behavior and social systems, and use this knowledge to create positive change in the world.</p><p></p><p>For more answers please follow:)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-Confidence and Performance</p><p>Self-confidence is considered one of the most influential motivators and regulators of behavior in people's everyday lives (Bandura, 1986). A growing body of evidence suggests that one's perception of ability or self-confidence is the central mediating construct of achievement strivings (e.g., Bandura, 1977; Ericsson et al., 1993; Harter, 1978; Kuhl, 1992; Nicholls, 1984). Ericsson and his colleagues have taken the position that the major influence in the acquisition of expert performance is the confidence and motivation to persist in deliberate practice for a minimum of 10 years.</p><p></p><p>Self-confidence is not a motivational perspective by itself. It is a judgment about capabilities for accomplishment of some goal, and, therefore, must be considered within a broader conceptualization of motivation that provides the goal context. Kanfer (1990a) provides an example of one cognitively based framework of motivation for such a discussion. She suggests that motivation is composed of two components: goal choice and self-regulation. Self-regulation, in turn, consists of three related sets of activities: self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reactions. Self-monitoring provides information about current performance, which is then evaluated by comparing that performance with one's goal. The comparison between performance and goal results in two distinct types of self-reactions: self-satisfaction or -dissatisfaction and self-confidence expectations. Satisfaction or dissatisfaction is an affective response to past actions; self-confidence expectations are judgments about one's future capabilities to attain one's goal. This framework allows a discussion of self-confidence as it relates to a number of motivational processes, including setting goals and causal attributions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa wekapidea kopo yan kinuha basahin nyo nalang po</p><p></p><br />
