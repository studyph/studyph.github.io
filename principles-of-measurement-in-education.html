Write your answer on the space provided before the number.__________ 1. Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</a>

                                            EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS OF THE ) REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES First Regular Session SENATE Senate Bill No. 689 Introduced by Senator FRANCIS N. PANGILINAN AN ACT PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION (SOGIE) AND PROVIDING PENALTIES THEREFOR EXPLANATORY NOTE 22 P3:37 According to the survey "The Global Divide on Homosexuality" by the Pew Research Center, 73% of adult Filipinos agree that homosexuality should be accepted by society. The Philippines placed second as the most gay-friendly country in the whole Asia-Pacific, after Australia. Just recently, some 70,000 people joined the Metro Manila Pride March - the largest and oldest Pride demonstration in Southeast Asia. Despite these overwhelming numbers, the Philippines is only more tolerant than accepting of the LGBT community. According to a United Nations (UN) study, 30% of LGBT in the country reported being harassed, bullied, or discriminated against by others while at work because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression (SOGIE). The same study also said 21% of Filipino respondents believed that they were denied a job because of their SOGIE. The country ranked 95th in the SPARTACUS Gay Travel Index 2019, which scored countries based on measures like trans gender rights, marriage equality, and the existence of anti-discrimination legislation. Countries such as Canada, Portugal, and Sweden, among others, have already enacted their own anti-discrimination laws. Five countries in the world - Bolivia, Ecuador, Fiji, Malta and the United Kingdom - have constitutions that explicitly guarantee equality on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In the Philippines, some local governments already have ordinances to protect the welfare of the LGBT community. In addition, the Department of Education issued the Gender-Responsive Basic Education Policy which primarily "commits to integrate the principles of gender equality, gender equity, gender sensitivity, non-discrimination and human rights in the provision and governance of basic education." It is high time for the Philippines to join the long list of countries with a national anti-discrimination law. With the hopes of giving the LGBT community full acceptance, and not just tolerance, this proposed legislation aims to finally eliminate the hate and discrimination against them. This bill also seeks to create an environment that is safe, equal, and reasonable for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. 1 out line​</a>

Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9.

                            16. EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS OF THE ) REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES First Regular Session SENATE Senate Bill No. 689 Introduced by Senator FRANCIS N. PANGILINAN AN ACT PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION (SOGIE) AND PROVIDING PENALTIES THEREFOR EXPLANATORY NOTE 22 P3:37 According to the survey "The Global Divide on Homosexuality" by the Pew Research Center, 73% of adult Filipinos agree that homosexuality should be accepted by society. The Philippines placed second as the most gay-friendly country in the whole Asia-Pacific, after Australia. Just recently, some 70,000 people joined the Metro Manila Pride March - the largest and oldest Pride demonstration in Southeast Asia. Despite these overwhelming numbers, the Philippines is only more tolerant than accepting of the LGBT community. According to a United Nations (UN) study, 30% of LGBT in the country reported being harassed, bullied, or discriminated against by others while at work because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression (SOGIE). The same study also said 21% of Filipino respondents believed that they were denied a job because of their SOGIE. The country ranked 95th in the SPARTACUS Gay Travel Index 2019, which scored countries based on measures like trans gender rights, marriage equality, and the existence of anti-discrimination legislation. Countries such as Canada, Portugal, and Sweden, among others, have already enacted their own anti-discrimination laws. Five countries in the world - Bolivia, Ecuador, Fiji, Malta and the United Kingdom - have constitutions that explicitly guarantee equality on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In the Philippines, some local governments already have ordinances to protect the welfare of the LGBT community. In addition, the Department of Education issued the Gender-Responsive Basic Education Policy which primarily "commits to integrate the principles of gender equality, gender equity, gender sensitivity, non-discrimination and human rights in the provision and governance of basic education." It is high time for the Philippines to join the long list of countries with a national anti-discrimination law. With the hopes of giving the LGBT community full acceptance, and not just tolerance, this proposed legislation aims to finally eliminate the hate and discrimination against them. This bill also seeks to create an environment that is safe, equal, and reasonable for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. 1 out line​</h2><br />
