How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</a>

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

Read the inspiring story below.One Story - Many LessonsOne morning while the family gathered at the breakfast table, mygrandfather turned to my dad, who was just entering the 6th grade and said,"Johnny, it's time you quit school and go to work on the farm to help supportthe family."Johnny was born the youngest of a family of five children in Alabama. His father was a farmer and part time police officer. Around the age of eleven, each male child was expected to stop school and help support the family.Tears streamed down my father's face and into his cereal bowl. "daddy," he begged, "if you will just let me stay in school, I will never cost you another cent. I'll earn my keep. I'll pay for my books, my clothes and my food. Please, daddy, just let me stay in school!"My grandfather thoughtfully replied, "O.K. Johnny, let's see if you can do that. But, if you can't, you'll have to work on the farm full time."The odds of earning a living at eleven years of age seemed very long. Aftemoons and weekends, he washed cars, mowed lawns, danced on street comers and shined shoes. While telling me this story, he proudly displayed the simple wooden shoebox he made to support the Southern gentlemen's shoes while he shined them.My father's intent in telling me this story was to make the point that in spite of his dire poverty, he was always clean and well groomed. He said, "Honey, although I only had enough money for two outfits at a time, I could always be clean. I bought soap for my clothes and myself, a needle and thread for clothing repairs and polish for my shoes. When one outfit was being washed and repaired, I wore the other.It probably never occurred to him that the main impression he left with me, his only daughter, was the value he placed on education. I saw photos of him. He was a darling little boy with curly, jet-black hair who eamed his own way in an adult world, while other children his age were playing after school sports.Johnny graduated from high school, danced professionally, worked for a national manufacturing company as a salesman and learned to fly small planes during the second world war. He used his education and his skills leamed as a street-corner dancer and a shoe shine boy. Finally, as a risktaker, he not only became a pilot but also the owner of an airport.Directions: Pick out lines from the story (One Story - Many Lessons) and write it inside the box.

                                            STORYThe Prince and the PauperMark TwainOnce upon a time, a son was born to a king and queen. He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king. He was deeply impressed withTom's honesty and loyalty. Tom became King Edward's favorite and he gave him thetitle as The King's WardPA HELP PO PLEASE PASAHAN NA PO KASI NAMIN MAMAYA​</a>

                                            World War XII, as everyone knows, brought about the collapse of civilization, Towns, cities, and villages disappeared. All the groves and forests were destroyed, and all the gardens, and all the works of art. Men, women, and children became lower than the animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen masters. Books, paintings and music disappeared from the earth, and human beings just sat around doing nothing. Years went by. Even the few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly. Love had passed from the Earth. One day, a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last flower was dying. The only one who paid any attention to her was a young man. Together, the young man and the girl nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day, a bee visited the flower, and a hummingbird. Before long, there were two flowers, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished again. The young girl began to take interest in how she looked. The young man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn into. the world. The children of the young man and the girl grew up strong and healthy. They learned to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man discovered how to build a shelter. Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages sprung up. Song came back into the world, and troubadours and jugglers, tailors and cobblers, painters and poets and sculptors, and soldiers and Lieutenants and Captains, and Generals and Major Generals, and liberators. Some people went to one place to live, and some to another. Before long, those who went to the valleys wished they had gone to live in the hills. And those who had to live in the hills wished they had gone to live in the valleys. The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the discontented. So presently, the world was at war again. This time, the destruction was so complete that nothing at all was left in the world, except one man, one woman, and one flower.B.Discuss the following questions1.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

The Indonesian Archipelago Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia that consists of more than 13,000 islands. The islands lie along the equator and extend more than 5,000 kilometers. Many of the islands cover only a few square kilometers. But about a half of New Guinea and three quarters of Borneo also belong to Indonesia. Both islands are the second-and-third largest islands in the world, after Greenland. Many geographers divide the more than 13,600 islands of Indonesia into three groups: (1) the Greater Sunda Islands, (2) the lesser Sunda Islands, and (3) the Mollucas. Indonesia also includes Irian Jaya, which is part of New Guinea. The Greater Sunda includes Borneo, Sulawesi, Java and Sumatera. The Lesser Sunda Islands extend from Bali eastward to the Timor. The Mollucas lie between Sulawesi and New Guinea. The western part of New Guinea is called Irian Jaya, an Indonesian territory. Compared to the other regions, Irian Jaya is the most thinly populated.

How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</h2><br />

                            11. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

                            21. Find out how messages, may it positive or negative, can affect a person's life. Read the inspiring story below.One Story - Many LessonsOne morning while the family gathered at the breakfast table, mygrandfather turned to my dad, who was just entering the 6th grade and said,"Johnny, it's time you quit school and go to work on the farm to help supportthe family."Johnny was born the youngest of a family of five children in Alabama. His father was a farmer and part time police officer. Around the age of eleven, each male child was expected to stop school and help support the family.Tears streamed down my father's face and into his cereal bowl. "daddy," he begged, "if you will just let me stay in school, I will never cost you another cent. I'll earn my keep. I'll pay for my books, my clothes and my food. Please, daddy, just let me stay in school!"My grandfather thoughtfully replied, "O.K. Johnny, let's see if you can do that. But, if you can't, you'll have to work on the farm full time."The odds of earning a living at eleven years of age seemed very long. Aftemoons and weekends, he washed cars, mowed lawns, danced on street comers and shined shoes. While telling me this story, he proudly displayed the simple wooden shoebox he made to support the Southern gentlemen's shoes while he shined them.My father's intent in telling me this story was to make the point that in spite of his dire poverty, he was always clean and well groomed. He said, "Honey, although I only had enough money for two outfits at a time, I could always be clean. I bought soap for my clothes and myself, a needle and thread for clothing repairs and polish for my shoes. When one outfit was being washed and repaired, I wore the other.It probably never occurred to him that the main impression he left with me, his only daughter, was the value he placed on education. I saw photos of him. He was a darling little boy with curly, jet-black hair who eamed his own way in an adult world, while other children his age were playing after school sports.Johnny graduated from high school, danced professionally, worked for a national manufacturing company as a salesman and learned to fly small planes during the second world war. He used his education and his skills leamed as a street-corner dancer and a shoe shine boy. Finally, as a risktaker, he not only became a pilot but also the owner of an airport.Directions: Pick out lines from the story (One Story - Many Lessons) and write it inside the box.

He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room.

He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king.

All the groves and forests were destroyed, and all the gardens, and all the works of art. Men, women, and children became lower than the animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen masters. Books, paintings and music disappeared from the earth, and human beings just sat around doing nothing. Years went by. Even the few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly. Love had passed from the Earth. One day, a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last flower was dying. The only one who paid any attention to her was a young man. Together, the young man and the girl nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day, a bee visited the flower, and a hummingbird. Before long, there were two flowers, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished again. The young girl began to take interest in how she looked. The young man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn into. the world. The children of the young man and the girl grew up strong and healthy. They learned to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man discovered how to build a shelter. Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages sprung up. Song came back into the world, and troubadours and jugglers, tailors and cobblers, painters and poets and sculptors, and soldiers and Lieutenants and Captains, and Generals and Major Generals, and liberators. Some people went to one place to live, and some to another. Before long, those who went to the valleys wished they had gone to live in the hills. And those who had to live in the hills wished they had gone to live in the valleys. The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the discontented. So presently, the world was at war again. This time, the destruction was so complete that nothing at all was left in the world, except one man, one woman, and one flower.B.Discuss the following questions1.

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

The Indonesian Archipelago Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia that consists of more than 13,000 islands. The islands lie along the equator and extend more than 5,000 kilometers. Many of the islands cover only a few square kilometers. But about a half of New Guinea and three quarters of Borneo also belong to Indonesia. Both islands are the second-and-third largest islands in the world, after Greenland. Many geographers divide the more than 13,600 islands of Indonesia into three groups: (1) the Greater Sunda Islands, (2) the lesser Sunda Islands, and (3) the Mollucas. Indonesia also includes Irian Jaya, which is part of New Guinea. The Greater Sunda includes Borneo, Sulawesi, Java and Sumatera. The Lesser Sunda Islands extend from Bali eastward to the Timor. The Mollucas lie between Sulawesi and New Guinea. The western part of New Guinea is called Irian Jaya, an Indonesian territory. Compared to the other regions, Irian Jaya is the most thinly populated.
