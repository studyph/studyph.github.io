Answer the questions below.Stepping Up for What Is Just(based on real events)Matthew Alganes1One evening in December 1955, Rosa Parks rode on a bus home after a longday’s work. During that time, black Americans were separated from white Americans in the bus. The front part of the bus was the section for white Americans; the back part wasthe section for black Americans. When the front part of the bus became full, blackpeople had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of theBus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seatto a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and otherblack Americans received everyday.3Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosaarrested by the police and sent her to jail.4This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycottthe buses by not riding on them. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when goingto work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced tochange the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companieswere losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the blackCitizens.5Rosa’s refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteenmonths after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregationin public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a lawknown as the “Civil Rights Act of 1964” that put an end to racial discrimination in theCountry.6The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative movefor the American people.Questions:1.

When the front part of the bus became full, black people had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of the bus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seat to a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and other black Americans received everyday.3Rosa and the bus driver had an argument.

Answer the questions in your notebook.Stepping Up for What Is Just (based on real events) Matthew Alganes¹One evening in December 1955, Rosa Parks rode on a bus home after a long day's work. During that time,black Americans were separated from white Americans in the bus. The front part of the bus was the section for whiteAmericans; the back part was the section for black Americans. When the front part of the bus became full, black people had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of the bus.²Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seat to a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and other black Americans received everyday.³Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosa arrested by the police and sent her to jail.⁴This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycott the buses by not riding onthem. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when going to work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced to change the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companies werelosing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the black citizens.⁵Rosa's refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteen months after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregation in public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a law known as the "Civil Rights Act of 1964" that put an end to racial discrimination in the country. ⁶The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative move for the American people.Questions:1. What does racial discrimination mean? How was racial discrimination shown in America before it ended in 1964?2. How did Rosa Park show her bravery? Fill in the graphic organizer below to show your answer. Support it by providing evidence.Rosa Park is a brave woman Evidence:Evidence:3. In your opinion, was it right for Rosa to refuse to follow the law at that time? Explain.4. Does racial discrimination still occur around the globe? List down your evidence.5.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Answer the questions below.Stepping Up for What Is Just(based on real events)Matthew Alganes1One evening in December 1955, Rosa Parks rode on a bus home after a longday’s work. During that time, black Americans were separated from white Americans in the bus. The front part of the bus was the section for white Americans; the back part wasthe section for black Americans. When the front part of the bus became full, blackpeople had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of theBus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seatto a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and otherblack Americans received everyday.3Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosaarrested by the police and sent her to jail.4This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycottthe buses by not riding on them. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when goingto work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced tochange the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companieswere losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the blackCitizens.5Rosa’s refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteenmonths after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregationin public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a lawknown as the “Civil Rights Act of 1964” that put an end to racial discrimination in theCountry.6The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative movefor the American people.Questions:1.

                            16. Learning Task 2 Read the passage carefully. Answer the questions in your notebook.Stepping Up for What Is Just(based on real events)Matthew Alganes1One evening in December 1955, Rosa Parks rode on a bus home after a long day’s work. During that time, black Americans were separated from white Americans inthe bus. The front part of the bus was the section for white Americans; the back part was the section for black Americans. When the front part of the bus became full, black people had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of the bus.2Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seat to a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and other black Americans received everyday.3Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosa arrested by the police and sent her to jail.4This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycott the buses by not riding on them. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when going to work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced to change the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companies were losing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the black citizens.5Rosa’s refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteen months after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregation in public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a lawknown as the “Civil Rights Act of 1964” that put an end to racial discrimination in the country. 6The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative move for the American peopleQuestions:1. What does racial discrimination mean? How was racial discrimination shown in America before it ended in 1964?2. How did Rosa Park show her bravery? Fill in the graphic organizer below to show your answer. Support it by providing evidence.3. In your opinion, was it right for Rosa to refuse to follow the law at that time?Explain.4. Does racial discrimination still occur around the globe? List down your evidence.5. How will you help Indigenous Peoples (IPs) like Badjaos from people who treat them unjustly?​</h2><br />

Middlemen are also known as They buy the products from the farm at a lower price and resell these to retailere or small stores. a marketing strategy where buyers go directly to the farm to buy larm products, Prices are usually cheaper because farmers do not need to transport their products to the market to save time, money and efforts. these are usually done by manufacturing companies when there is a need for a big volume of products. is done by non-profitable organizations of workers. They own and manage the organization and prioritize the product sold by their organization a marketing strategy where in the satisfied consumer tells other people about their experiences on how much they like the product. is a marketing strategy in which the owners convince the consumers or buyers through giving free samples of the product to try.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Major Markets</p><p></p><p>Fruits and vegetables are produced seasonally, but the market requires products throughout the year. For many decades, this problem of matching product availability with consumer demand was solved in two ways:</p><p></p><p>Selling fresh products during harvest and shortly thereafter</p><p>Processing the rest to meet demand during the rest of the year</p><p>As technology improved and consumer incomes increased, it became possible to provide fresh produce year-round. American consumers now expect fresh tomatoes, strawberries, and sweet corn every month of the year. In addition, a strong demand remains for processed fruits and vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Fresh Markets</p><p></p><p>Increased consumer incomes and year-round demand for fresh produce force retailers or their representatives to establish buying points both in different growing areas of the United States and in foreign countries. Some retailers contract year-round with fresh fruit and vegetable packers, who may in turn contract with growers. Contracts and large-volume buying practices enable packers to obtain sufficient quantities of individual products.</p><p></p><p>Large fresh fruit and vegetable packers may contract with growers in several different production regions to ensure that fresh fruits and vegetables are available every week of the year. These packers generally contract only in regions with a large number of growers. Further, they contract mainly with the largest growers, even in concentrated production regions. Some packers ensure supplies by growing commodities themselves. Large retailers and packers are unlikely to purchase products directly from a single, small-scale grower, especially a grower in a remote production area.</p><p></p><p>As a small-scale fresh fruit and vegetable grower, you may consider selling directly to retailers. Although some chain stores and independent retailers have buy-local programs for fresh produce, such stores and programs are not common. You must develop your own marketing system. In effect, you must become the grower, packer, and wholesaler.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Processing Markets</p><p></p><p>To stay competitive, processors must keep unit costs low, so large corporations generally do the processing. Many of the smaller local processors have found it difficult to compete with these corporations and have gone out of business. Almost all processors contract with growers for their raw-product needs. Over the past twenty to thirty years, most processors have moved their plants to major production areas. Only a few processing firms are left in the Northeast. Therefore, it may be difficult to locate processors interested in buying from small-scale growers. If a processor does indicate a willingness to buy, insist on a purchase contract with the processor before planting the crop.</p><p></p><p>You may wish to process your own fruits and vegetables. This is how many of today's processors entered the business decades ago. If you are considering a processing operation, contact your state Department of Agriculture to learn more about food regulations pertaining to the processing, packaging, and labeling of your product. It will probably be impossible for you to process and market produce at costs as low as those incurred by larger processors. As a result, it may be very difficult to compete for sales with your processed fruits and vegetables through conventional retail outlets. Consider processing specialty items with strong local or regional demand where you will be able to charge a "premium" price.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes a small processor will process fruits or vegetables for a grower on a contract basis, especially if the product being produced does not interfere with its own processing requirements. Of course, its busy time is often when you need to process your product, so this works best for something with an especially early or late processing season.</p><p></p><p>Selling processed fruits or vegetables may, in addition, increase your exposure to product liability suits. Check with an attorney and an insurance carrier to determine the degree of liability exposure and to secure the proper level of protection</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>CARRY ON LEARNING </p><p>BYE HAVE A GOOD TIME</p><br />

                            23. Learning Task 2Directions: Read the passage carefully. Answer the questions in your notebook.Stepping Up for What Is Just (based on real events) Matthew Alganes¹One evening in December 1955, Rosa Parks rode on a bus home after a long day's work. During that time,black Americans were separated from white Americans in the bus. The front part of the bus was the section for whiteAmericans; the back part was the section for black Americans. When the front part of the bus became full, black people had to give up their seats to white people. Rosa sat in the black section of the bus.²Shortly, the white section was filled. The bus driver asked Rosa to give up her seat to a white person, but she refused. She was tired of the treatment that she and other black Americans received everyday.³Rosa and the bus driver had an argument. Eventually, the driver had Rosa arrested by the police and sent her to jail.⁴This made the black citizens of Montgomery angry so they decided to boycott the buses by not riding onthem. Instead, they organized carpools or walked when going to work. The boycott which was done hoping that city officials would be forced to change the unfair segregation laws lasted for 381 days. Although the bus companies werelosing a lot of money, the city officials did not give in to the demands of the black citizens.⁵Rosa's refusal to follow an unjust law was not disregarded though. Thirteen months after the boycott started, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the segregation in public transportation was unconstitutional. In 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a law known as the "Civil Rights Act of 1964" that put an end to racial discrimination in the country. ⁶The bravery shown by Rosa Park that night proved to be a transformative move for the American people.Questions:1. What does racial discrimination mean? How was racial discrimination shown in America before it ended in 1964?2. How did Rosa Park show her bravery? Fill in the graphic organizer below to show your answer. Support it by providing evidence.Rosa Park is a brave woman Evidence:Evidence:3.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.
