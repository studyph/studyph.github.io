Over exposure to non-ionizing radiation can cause cancer, particularly skin cancer.2. Too much exposure to X-rays can damage body tissues and can cause cancer.3. If you work around nonradioactive materials it's good to have a radiation detector.4. Use a Respirator or Face Mask if you are exposed to airborne sources.5. We are all exposed to radiation every day from natural sources, outer space, the earth, radon gas inour homes and businesses.6. Risk reduction is unusually an automatic process for most potential hazards.7. EMFs or electromagnetic factors are essentially electric and magnetic fields that radiate energy8. To reduce your exposure to EMF's you can put your cellphone into airplane mode.9. Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavestrengths and frequencies.10. According to the first law of reflection, the angle of incident ray is unequal to the angle of reflectedray.11. Reflected ray is the ray of light which leaves the mirror,12. The angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray is the angle of reflection13. Reflection is the bouncing of light rays when it hits a surface like a plane mirror.14. Plane mirrors exhibits irregular reflection where the angle of incidence is equal to the angle ofreflection15. The second law states that the normal line, incident ray and reflected ray all lie in thesame plane.II.Identification.

Risk reduction is unusually an automatic process for most potential hazards.7. EMFs or electromagnetic factors are essentially electric and magnetic fields that radiate energy8. To reduce your exposure to EMF's you can put your cellphone into airplane mode.9. Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavestrengths and frequencies.10. According to the first law of reflection, the angle of incident ray is unequal to the angle of reflectedray.11. Reflected ray is the ray of light which leaves the mirror,12.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. C. circle </p><p>- A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a given point called the center of the circle.</p><p></p><p>2. D. semicircle</p><p>- An arc whose measure equals 180 degrees is called a semicircle, since it divides the circle in two.</p><p></p><p>3. B. radius</p><p>- Any interval (or line segment) drawn from the centre of a given circle to any point on the circle is called a radius (plural radii).</p><p></p><p>4. B. center</p><p>- A circle is the locus of points in a plane that are all at an equal distance from a single point, called the CENTER OF CIRCLE.</p><p></p><p>5. D. arc</p><p>- An arc of a circle is a continuous portion of the circle. It consists of two endpoints and all the points on the circle between these endpoints.</p><p></p><p>6. C. minor arc</p><p>- An arc whose measure is less than 180 degrees is called a minor arc. An arc whose measure is greater than 180 degrees is called a major arc.</p><p></p><p>7. D. diameter</p><p>- A line segment that crosses the circle by passing through the center of the circle is called the diameter.</p><p></p><p>8. A. central angle</p><p>- What is the Inscribed Angle? An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on a circle, and its two sides are chords of the same circle. On the other hand, a central angle is an angle whose vertex lies at the center of a circle, and its two radii are the sides of the angle</p><p></p><p>9.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Tools
</strong></p><p><strong>There is much more to tools for electronics than just screwdrivers and
</strong></p><p><strong>pliers. While most of the common tools can be found at a local hardware or
</strong></p><p><strong>home improvement store, many are unique to the electronics
</strong></p><p><strong>industry. These specialized tools have evolved over many years, in some
</strong></p><p><strong>cases starting out as modified versions of common hardware store types,
</strong></p><p><strong>and in other cases designed from the outset to fulfill a specific need.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>For the most part, you shouldn’t need to spend a lot of money on odd-ball
</strong></p><p><strong>tools if you stick to the common hardware described in not available
</strong></p><p><strong>and avoid things like surface-mounted components with ultra-fine pitch leads.
</strong></p><p><strong>If you need to use an integrated circuit (IC) with something like 144 leads with hair-width spaces between the leads, then you should probably consider paying someone to mount it for you using screened solder paste and a reflow soldering system. For just a single project, it might not be worth the expense of acquiring a decent bench microscope and a fancy surface-mount soldering station and then learning to use it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>This chapter is a survey of some of the common tools you should consider
</strong></p><p><strong>owning for working with modern electronics. It is not intended to be a
</strong></p><p><strong>definitive or comprehensive guide. There are hand tools, power tools, and
</strong></p><p><strong>bench-mounted tools for tightening, cutting, drilling, and trimming. Other
</strong></p><p><strong>tools are used for soldering, inspecting, and finishing. I would suggest
</strong></p><p><strong>obtaining a selection of catalogs from companies such as Digikey and Mouser
</strong></p><p><strong>and perusing the tool sections. If you have a good electronics supply
</strong></p><p><strong>outlet nearby, it might be useful to browse its display racks to get an
</strong></p><p><strong>idea of what’s available and examine the tools in person.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Screwdrivers
</strong></p><p><strong>For every screw type there is a screwdriver. For most tasks, a basic selection
</strong></p><p><strong>of screwdrivers, such as the ones shown in Figure 1-1, is all you’ll need.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>pect 0301
</strong></p><p><strong>Figure 1-1. Screwdrivers
</strong></p><p><strong>However, if you plan on disassembling consumer electronics or a toy, then
</strong></p><p><strong>you might also need some rather odd screwdriver types. A set of miniature
</strong></p><p><strong>and specialty screwdrivers, such as the one shown in Figure 1-2, is essential for these types of situations.
</strong></p><p><strong>You can find sets like this on eBay. Just bear in mind that these imported tools are generally not made from the highest-quality metal (that’s why they are so inexpensive), and they can be easily ruined if used incorrectly.
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Pliers
</strong></p><p><strong>The pliers available from a hardware store or other locations are
</strong></p><p><strong>acceptable for many tasks, but they are not always ideal for working
</strong></p><p><strong>with electronics. Figure 1-4 shows a selection of typical tools
</strong></p><p><strong>you might find at an auto parts or home improvement store.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
