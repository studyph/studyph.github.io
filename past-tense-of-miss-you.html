                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yeah of course, I miss my school, as well as my teachers, classmates, and especially my friends, because there was a time when we did an activity with our E.S.P. teacher in which we shared our problems, laughed at the craziest and funniest things we did in our lives, cried together because they reminded us of the saddest moments in our lives, and also told our classmates who among them we were angry at. And we're all really relieved after that activity. After that, we're already at ease discussing our own concerns with one another. That's why I adore E.S.P.</p><br />
