Select the letter of the correct answer to complete the sentence.
1. The verb is in its active form if the (a. object, b. subject, c. verb) is
thedoer of the action.
2.
Voice refers to (a. who or what is the subject, b. who or what is
doing the action, c. who or what is the object of the verb)
3. The verb is in its passive form if the (a. object, b. subject, c. verb)
is not doing the action.
4.
We should be familiar of forms, "to be" also known as (a.
helping/linking verb, b. main verb, c. verb phrase) in order to
understand passivevoice.
5.
The active voice is preferred because it is more (a. convenient, b.
easier, c. direct).
6.
In converting active to passive voice, the subject of the sentence
in the active voice will become the (a. object, b. subject, c. verb)
of the preposition, "by".
7. We need to change the main verb into (a. past participle, b. past
tense, c. present tense) in order to convert active to passive voice.
In converting passive to active voice, the subject of the sentence
in the passive voice will become the (a. direct object, b. subject,
c.verb) </a>

Often when converting direct speech into indirect speech the tense will backshift, meaning move backwards in tense. Two aspects influence this:</p><p>– the tense of the reporting verb i.e. he says, he said, he will say etc.  </p><p>– the tense of the reported speech itself i.e. the words contained in the speech marks</p><p></p><p>However, you do not need to change the tense if the reporting verb is in the present, or if the original statement was about something that is still true, e.g. </p><p></p><br />
