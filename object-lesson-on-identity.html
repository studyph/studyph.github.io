Living things may have millions or trillions of cells called multicellular organisms or may contain one cell called ee the cells using our own eye because they are too tiny. Have you ever imagine how the scientists discover what would the structure of the cells really look like? How are these true identities of the objects being revealed? What different tools can we use to make things bigger? Cai you name some of it? Where is it being used? Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. TOOL/S USE/S As we go along with our lesson, activities will be more exciting and thrilling. Are ady? Let's get started.​</h2><br />
