Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This study was conducted to describe students' opinion of energy conservation and environmental issues during campus activities. It was a descriptive quantitative research using survey method. The subjects were 26 students of the first, second, and third-year students of Natural Science Department of Unesa. These students are pre-service teachers for senior high school level. The result shows that 43.75% students throw trash in different bins based on the material, 25% students take trash that is not thrown properly in campus area, and only 6.25% students clean their classroom after the class is over. This showed that their awareness of environmental condition is still low. Nevertheless, some students participated in weekly eco-campus activities. However, most of them join it involuntarily. The results also showed that they conserve the energy by turning-on lamp and air conditioner when it is needed only. It means that they know that they have to conserve although only some of students who doing that activities. In conclusion, some students are already aware about their environment and how to conserve the energy. So, they need more activities to enhance their awareness of environmental issues during campus activities, both in academic activities and non-academic activities.</p><br />

                            10. Let’s Apply
Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.

These <strong>programs</strong> will help many people, especially the <strong>youth</strong>, to know about<strong> sexually transmitted diseases</strong>. Also, I could conduct role-playing concerning safe sex and even train resistance skills to overcome peer pressure in this situation. </p><p></p><p>In these current times, unsafe sex is a primary route of this <strong>disease</strong>, and it is increasing. This <strong>disease</strong> has surged many people; most are diagnosed younger than 19. We should take action on this issue and raise awareness so that the <strong>youth</strong> would benefit and know the essence of it. Do not delay this since the lives of the <strong>youth</strong> depends on here.</p><p></p><p><strong>Example of a slogan about raising awareness to eliminate sexually transmitted diseases in the youth:</strong> brainly.ph/question/20327022</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
