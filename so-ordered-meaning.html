                                            1. There are few facts about the role of obedience when committing acts againstone's personal conscience (1961). Most theories suggest that only very disturbed people arecapable of administering pain to an ordinary citizen if they are ordered to do so. Our experimenttested people's obedience to authority. The results showed that most obey all orders given by theauthority-figure, despite their unwillingness. The conclusion is that, contrary to common belief,personal ethics mean little when pitted against authority.patulong please po nasa box ang choices.​</a>
