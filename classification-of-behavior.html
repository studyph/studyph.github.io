Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.

Priorities, by definition, are the goals, dreams, and concepts that we deem important. They may range, for instance, from the appeal of fame and fortune to the simple pleasures of spending time with the family or from noble causes of improving the community to the mundane matters of finishing an important project. They develop our code of behavior in life. How important, how valuable, and how priceless something is to us determines our choice and behavior in almost any critical situation we are in. When circumstances change, either because of us or despite us, the alteration of priorities should be based on an interplay of wisdom and character.
- Adapted, McCormack 61

                        <p><strong>Answer: The body has about 75 mg of copper, about one-third of which is found in the muscles. Copper combines with certain proteins to produce enzymes that act as catalysts to help a number of body functions. Some are involved in the transformation of melanin for pigmentation of the skin, and others help to form cross-links in collagen and elastin and thereby maintain and repair connective tissues. This is especially important for the heart and arteries. Research suggests that copper deficiency is one factor leading to an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: i hope its help </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
