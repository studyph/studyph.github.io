                                            Objectives
Petrol-driven motor vehicles such as the typical domestic car comprise of mechanical and electrical systems that generate heat and energy in close proximity to the fuel, petrol. Since the layout of most cars is somewhat similar and known to many delegates, in this hypothetical exercise, you are required to area classify the vehicle shown in below images.
The task is complete when the sketch of the car has been clearly marked with adequate information on the “hazard” and the area classification assigned to the vehicle in its various conditions of use. Indicate any areas you wish to designate Zone 0, 1 or 2. Give justifications for your answers (Q1a).
Supplementary instructions 
It is appreciated that you may have insufficient information to complete the task. Where you require more information, note this need adjacent to a relevant part or area. The vehicle detail shown is diagrammatic and is specifically for the purposes of this exercise. Any assumptions made should be recorded by appropriate annotations.
Side elevation of car
Plan view of car
Method of approach 
•	Use the principles and terminology outlined in Chapter 3 of this course. 
•	Assess the risk by taking account of the nature of the hazard. 
Consider the likely operational situations:
•	Parked in a garage.
•	Parked on the road.
•	Low speed.
•	High speed.
•	Engine running but car stationary 
•	Accidents of varying degree of severity 
•	Fuel leakage and spillage 
Your ideas should list the methodology used including:
•	The identification of all sources of ignition (electrical and mechanical).
•	The identification of all locations and routes (storage and piping) of fuel. 
Petrol flammability characteristics
•	Flashpoint: -40°C 
•	Ignition Temperature: 310°C
•	Vapour density: 1.24
•	Ignition energy: IIA
•	Vapour dispersion in still air: 4 metres in diameter from source of release. 0.5 metres high from the level ground 
You are urged to consider the following situations:
•	The vehicle is first started (from cold).
•	The engine running but the vehicle is stationary.
•	The car moves slowly, say, below 10mph/16kph.
•	Higher speeds above this value.
•	Accidents of varying degrees of severity.
•	Long term storage.
•	Fuel leaks and spillage.
a)	What other influences are present on the behavior of the fuel and/or vapour?
b)	How do you think the car can be made ‘safe’ from the risk of explosion?</a>

                                            Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</a>

According to Panigrahi et.al. (2018) proposed that the integration of virtual communities to online learning platforms may cause a better outcome and engagement. Also, Picciano (2002) found out in his study that the success of many online course is dependent upon the nature of student to student and student to faculty interaction.

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                                            Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</a>

                                            Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</a>

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

                            7. Objectives
Petrol-driven motor vehicles such as the typical domestic car comprise of mechanical and electrical systems that generate heat and energy in close proximity to the fuel, petrol. Since the layout of most cars is somewhat similar and known to many delegates, in this hypothetical exercise, you are required to area classify the vehicle shown in below images.
The task is complete when the sketch of the car has been clearly marked with adequate information on the “hazard” and the area classification assigned to the vehicle in its various conditions of use. Indicate any areas you wish to designate Zone 0, 1 or 2. Give justifications for your answers (Q1a).
Supplementary instructions 
It is appreciated that you may have insufficient information to complete the task. Where you require more information, note this need adjacent to a relevant part or area. The vehicle detail shown is diagrammatic and is specifically for the purposes of this exercise. Any assumptions made should be recorded by appropriate annotations.
Side elevation of car
Plan view of car
Method of approach 
•	Use the principles and terminology outlined in Chapter 3 of this course. 
•	Assess the risk by taking account of the nature of the hazard. 
Consider the likely operational situations:
•	Parked in a garage.
•	Parked on the road.
•	Low speed.
•	High speed.
•	Engine running but car stationary 
•	Accidents of varying degree of severity 
•	Fuel leakage and spillage 
Your ideas should list the methodology used including:
•	The identification of all sources of ignition (electrical and mechanical).
•	The identification of all locations and routes (storage and piping) of fuel. 
Petrol flammability characteristics
•	Flashpoint: -40°C 
•	Ignition Temperature: 310°C
•	Vapour density: 1.24
•	Ignition energy: IIA
•	Vapour dispersion in still air: 4 metres in diameter from source of release. 0.5 metres high from the level ground 
You are urged to consider the following situations:
•	The vehicle is first started (from cold).
•	The engine running but the vehicle is stationary.
•	The car moves slowly, say, below 10mph/16kph.
•	Higher speeds above this value.
•	Accidents of varying degrees of severity.
•	Long term storage.
•	Fuel leaks and spillage.
a)	What other influences are present on the behavior of the fuel and/or vapour?
b)	How do you think the car can be made ‘safe’ from the risk of explosion?</h2><br />

                            8. Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</h2><br />

                            16. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I will agree with this, considering that religion plays a significant role in human society and culture. It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />

Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</h2><br />

                            24. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />
