2. This occurs when an object experiences an increase or decrease in velocity at the 
same rate throughout the motion.
 a. Collision b. Uniformly accelerated motion c. Free fall motion
3. It refers to any motion of an object or body solely influenced by gravity. It means that 
the effect of air resistance is negligible and therefore has an insignificant effect on the 
falling object.
 a. Collision b. Uniformly accelerated motion c. Free fall motion
4. This is sometimes referred to as air friction is a frictional force which opposes the 
motion of a falling object
a. Air resistance b. dropped c. thrown downward d. thrown upward

II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance
5. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same acceleration if air 
resistance is neglected.
6. In physics, an external force acting on an object over a specific time leads to a change in 
momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.

                                            Direction: Write I if the statement is true and F if it is false.1. Projectile motion occurs when a moving object experiences only the acceleration due to gravity which actsvertically downward.2. In projectile motion, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity affects the trajectory in a significant way.3. The speed of a projectile depends only on its height above its launch point, and not on whether it is movingupward or downward.4. The time to reach maximum height from any point is equal to the time spent returning from the maximumheight to the point.5. A projectile has 2 components: the horizontal and vertical.6. An object that is initially thrown into the air and continues to move on its path without the action of gravity is anexample of projectile motion.7. The vertical component is uniform motion while the horizontal component if free fall.8. In projectile motion, the change occurs only in the horizontal velocity.9. Victors are quantities with magnitude only.10. If air resistance is neglected, a projectile moves horizontally at increasing speed and simultaneously travelsvertically with acceleration equal to g.​</a>

                            10. Direction: Write I if the statement is true and F if it is false.1. Projectile motion occurs when a moving object experiences only the acceleration due to gravity which actsvertically downward.2. In projectile motion, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity affects the trajectory in a significant way.3. The speed of a projectile depends only on its height above its launch point, and not on whether it is movingupward or downward.4. The time to reach maximum height from any point is equal to the time spent returning from the maximumheight to the point.5. A projectile has 2 components: the horizontal and vertical.6. An object that is initially thrown into the air and continues to move on its path without the action of gravity is anexample of projectile motion.7. The vertical component is uniform motion while the horizontal component if free fall.8. In projectile motion, the change occurs only in the horizontal velocity.9. Victors are quantities with magnitude only.10. If air resistance is neglected, a projectile moves horizontally at increasing speed and simultaneously travelsvertically with acceleration equal to g.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1a. Yes, it is possible for the roller coaster car to reach the bottom of the hill with less kinetic energy than it would have if it had been released from rest at the bottom of the hill instead of the top. This is because the roller coaster car has potential energy due to its height above the ground at the top of the hill, which gets converted into kinetic energy as it slides down the hill. So, if the roller coaster car is released from rest at the bottom of the hill, it will only have kinetic energy. But if it is released from rest at the top of the hill, it will have both potential and kinetic energy. Therefore, the roller coaster car can have the same final kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill, regardless of whether it was released from rest at the top or the bottom of the hill.</p><p></p><p>1b. The roller coaster car experiences a change in gravitational potential energy without a corresponding change in kinetic energy at the top of the hill and at the bottom of the hill. At the top of the hill, the roller coaster car has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. At the bottom of the hill, the roller coaster car has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. The significance of this observation is that the total mechanical energy (i.e., the sum of kinetic and potential energy) of the roller coaster car is conserved as it moves from one position to another, assuming no external forces are acting on it.</p><p></p><p>2a. The lifted object has maximum potential energy at the highest point and minimum potential energy at the ground level. When the object is lifted, work is done against gravity to increase its potential energy. When the object is lowered, work is done by gravity to decrease its potential energy. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total mechanical energy of the system (i.e., the object and the Earth) is conserved, so the decrease in potential energy is converted into an increase in kinetic energy.</p><p></p><p>2b. When the object is released from rest at the top of the height, it falls freely under the influence of gravity and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The total mechanical energy of the system remains conserved during the free fall because there are no external forces acting on the object. The velocity of the object increases as it falls, and the velocity at any time can be calculated using the equation v = gt, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and t is the time. The velocity of the object increases as time increases, and the kinetic energy of the object also increases correspondingly, while the potential energy decreases. The total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.</p><p></p><p>2c. If the object is lifted to a different height or has a different mass, the maximum potential energy and the maximum height it can reach will change. The maximum potential energy is proportional to the mass and the height of the object, and the maximum height it can reach is determined by the initial potential energy and the kinetic energy at the highest point. The conservation of energy principle still applies to these scenarios.</p><p></p><p>2d. If the object is given an initial velocity vo in the upward direction, it will move upward, but its velocity will decrease due to the gravitational force until it reaches the highest point. At the highest point, the velocity is zero and the potential energy is maximum. Then, the object falls freely under the influence of gravity and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The maximum height reached by the object depends on its initial velocity and can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle. The significance of this observation is that the total mechanical energy of the system remains conserved throughout the motion of the object.</p><br />
