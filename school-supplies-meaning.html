                                            B. Scenario Car, buses, motorcycles, and other fuel-powered vehicles are our means of going to school or work, buying food and supplies, and many others that require us to go to distant places. But these vehicles are also the primary cause of air pollution around the world. They give off toxic materials that can harm our health and environment. They also release carbon dioxide gases which cause the warming of the earth's atmosphere. Imagine that you live in the near future when fossil fuels are no longer available. Can you suggest other sources of electrical energy? What would be the consequences of using those other (alternative) sources of energy? You can draw your vision of an alternative energy source of electrical energy.​</a>

But these vehicles are also the primary cause of air pollution around the world. They give off toxic materials that can harm our health and environment. They also release carbon dioxide gases which cause the warming of the earth's atmosphere. Imagine that you live in the near future when fossil fuels are no longer available.

Scenario Car, buses, motorcycles, and other fuel-powered vehicles are our means of going to school or work, buying food and supplies, and many others that require us to go to distant places. But these vehicles are also the primary cause of air pollution around the world. They give off toxic materials that can harm our health and environment. They also release carbon dioxide gases which cause the warming of the earth's atmosphere. Imagine that you live in the near future when fossil fuels are no longer available. Can you suggest other sources of electrical energy? What would be the consequences of using those other (alternative) sources of energy? You can draw your vision of an alternative energy source of electrical energy.​</h2><br />
