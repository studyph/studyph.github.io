                                            A soft drink company has recently received customer complaints about its one-liter-sized soft drink products. Customers have been claiming that the one-liter-sized products contain less than one liter of soft drink. The company has decided to investigate the problem. According to the company records, when there is no malfunctioning in the beverage dispensing unit, the bottles contain 1.01 liters of beverage on average, with a standard deviation of 0.16 liters. A sample of 50 bottles has been taken to be measured from the beverage dispensing lot. The mean amount of beverage in these 50 bottles was 0.995 liters. Find the probability of observing a sample mean of 0.995 liters or less in a sample of bottles, if the beverage dispensing unit functions properly.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In economics, a production function gives the technological relation between quantities of physical inputs and quantities of output of goods. The production function is one of the key concepts of mainstream neoclassical theories, used to define marginal product and to distinguish allocative efficiency, a key focus of economics. One important purpose of the production function is to address allocative efficiency in the use of factor inputs in production and the resulting distribution of income to those factors, while abstracting away from the technological problems of achieving technical efficiency, as an engineer or professional manager might understand it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p></p><br />

Know their meanings and specify their role/function in innovating the products</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Laser Engraving:  This form of decorating uses a laser beam to etch a design into the material, creating intricate patterns or text. Laser engraving is used on a variety of materials from wood to acrylics to metals, and can be used for both production and prototyping purposes. It produces an incredibly precise finish that is both permanent and long-lasting.</p><p></p><p>2. Silk Screen Printing: Silk screen printing is a popular decorating technique for large-scale orders, digital or otherwise. This process involves pressing a stencil through a mesh screen onto a desired object. The stencil is pressed against the object, and a specific ink is then imprinted onto the object to produce a unique and specifically designed artwork.</p><p></p><p>3. Embroidery: This decorative technique involves using a needle and thread to create a design on a fabric item. Embroidery adds a unique and personalized touch to any product and can be used to showcase logos and artwork on fabrics like t-shirts, caps, and bags.</p><p></p><p>4. Decals: Decals are a type of adhesive label used to decorate products. They are available in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors and can be printed or designed to feature any image or text.</p><p></p><p>5. Foil Stamping: Foil stamping is a type of printing process that uses a metallic or colorful foil to enhance the look of a product by imprinting a design onto the surface of the item. The final product is a foil-adhered logo or artwork that adds a touch of shine and glamor.</p><p></p><p>6. Hot Stamping: This is a decoration technique that involves the application of a heated metal die with a design to the surface of the product. This method of decorating is mostly used to imprint text onto leather, plastic, and other materials, as the heat melts the die into the substrate. </p><p></p><p>7. Pad Printing: Pad printing is a common method used to decorate products with printable ink. It involves transferring an image to a silicone pad, which is then pressed onto the product. This technique uses specific inks and covers a wide variety of materials, and is ideal for items that need to be printed on their sides or in awkward shapes.</p><p></p><p>8. Sand etching: Also known as sandblasting, this technique removes a thin layer of the top of the product's surface using sand particles propelled at high speeds. The overall effect is a dull etched level on the surface of the material, which can be customized to feature intricate designs.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Testing a product follows the same process of identifying independent and</p><p>extraneous variables, setting values for these variables, and then making</p><p>observations to come up with values for the dependent variables. It is done only when it has been proclaimed by the researcher that the product is “finished.” This means that the <strong>prototype </strong>is built and that there are no more changes that will be made to its design or functional specifications.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />

                            14. Directions. Read each statement carefully. Write T if the statement is correct,otherwise write F.1. The law of diminishing marginal utility means that the total utilityincreases but at a decreasing rate.2. Total Uhlity is defined as the sum of the satisfaction that a personcan receive from the consumption of all units of a specific product.3. Consumers lose satisfaction in a product the more they consume it.4. People are seldom satisfied with one trip to the shops and always wantto consume more.5. Uhly function shows how individuals make choices, subject to howmuch income they have available to spend, and the prices of goods andservices6. Marginal Product is the change in the total product as a result ofchanging the variable factor of production by 1 unit.7. If the marginal product is less than the average product, then the averageproduct will rise8. In the long-run, all factors of production are fixed.9. The theory of production explains the principles by which a business firmdecides how much of each commodity that it will produce10. The average product refers to the average contribution per unit of input.​</h2><br />
