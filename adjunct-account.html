                                            bakit ba yung mga user nag answer ng question di naman alam.A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages.[1] In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.[2] This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence "The tree was pulled down", the subject (the tree) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences "Someone pulled down the tree" and "The tree is down" are active sentences.Typically, in passive clauses, what is usually expressed by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now expressed by the subject, while what is usually expressed by the subject is either omitted or is indicated by some adjunct of the clause. Thus, turning an active sense of a verb into a passive sense is a valence-decreasing process ("detransitivizing process"), because it syntactically turns a transitive sense into an intransitive sense.[3] This is not always the case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence.[4]Many languages have both an active and a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject.[5] The use of passive voice allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role;[5] it may also be useful when the semantic patient is the topic of on-going discussion.[6] The passive voice may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action.​</a>

                            10. bakit ba yung mga user nag answer ng question di naman alam.A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages.[1] In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.[2] This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence "The tree was pulled down", the subject (the tree) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences "Someone pulled down the tree" and "The tree is down" are active sentences.Typically, in passive clauses, what is usually expressed by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now expressed by the subject, while what is usually expressed by the subject is either omitted or is indicated by some adjunct of the clause. Thus, turning an active sense of a verb into a passive sense is a valence-decreasing process ("detransitivizing process"), because it syntactically turns a transitive sense into an intransitive sense.[3] This is not always the case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence.[4]Many languages have both an active and a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject.[5] The use of passive voice allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role;[5] it may also be useful when the semantic patient is the topic of on-going discussion.[6] The passive voice may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action.​</h2><br />

                            17. what is the rationale behind the giving of allopurinol as adjunct to chemotherapy?​</h2><br />
                        what is the rationale behind the giving of allopurinol as adjunct to chemotherapy? <br /><br />Allopurinol can be given at the start of a course of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy medicines start to kill the cancer cells, uric acid is released from these cells which can crystallise causing damage to the kidneys. Allopurinol stops these crystals from forming.<br /><br />Allopurinol is used to treat gout, high levels of uric acid in the body caused by certain cancer medications, and kidney stones. Allopurinol is in a class of medications called xanthine oxidase inhibitors. It works by reducing the production of uric acid in the body.<br /><br />Allopurinol works by reducing the amount of uric acid made by body cells. In gout, this helps prevent uric acid crystals building up in the joints. This helps prevent joints becoming swollen and painful. In cancer, some cancer treatments kill cancer cells and uric acid is then released from these cells.<br /><br />While not commonly used together for the treatment of various chronic conditions, the concomitant use of allopurinol and azathioprine has been used to improve outcomes in pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, prevention of rejection in organ transplantation, and reducing thiopurine-induced ...<br />

A rainbow is formed when light (generally sunlight) passes through water droplets hanging in the atmosphere. The white light enters the water droplet, where it bends in several different directions. When these bent light waves reach the other side of the water droplet, they reflect back out of the droplet instead of completely traversing the water. Since the white light is separated inside of the water, the refracted light appears as separate colors to the human eye. _________2.

                        Mountaineering means climbing mountains. It's different from other outdoor sports because you don't need special equipment or fields to play in. The hill itself is the challenge. Climbing a mountain requires you to be brave, intelligent, strong, and have lots of energy, and risks are involved.Hiking means walking for a long time outdoors. Hiking is significant when climbing a mountain because you must keep moving and climbing for many hours.Rock climbing is a sport where you use ropes to climb up a rock wall. You must cooperate with your team, manage your body, and have a good pace. People usually begin by learning on small rocks.When you climb mountains that are covered in snow and ice, it's essential to have a tool called an<strong> ice ax</strong>. It helps you climb better and be safer.<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my opinion, mountaineering is a unique and challenging outdoor sport that requires a combination of physical and mental strength, skills, and endurance. Unlike other sports, mountaineering relies heavily on natural environments such as mountains and peaks. Climbers are constantly challenged by the natural surroundings, including harsh weather conditions, dangerous terrains, and unpredictable situations, all of which demand high levels of courage, resourcefulness, and cunning.</p><p></p><p>At the core of mountaineering is hiking, which involves steady and persistent climbing with one foot in front of the other. Hiking can be one of the most challenging aspects of mountaineering, as it requires stamina and endurance to traverse the lower slopes of mountains. However, it is also the most essential activity for climbing mountains.</p><p></p><p>Rock climbing also plays a major role in mountaineering, as it teaches climbers the necessary skills for teamwork, rope work, control, and rhythm. Local cliffs are often the training grounds for rock climbing before climbers move on to bigger peaks.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, snow and ice techniques are vital for high mountaineering, and the use of the ice ax is crucial for climbers. It allows them to navigate through icy surfaces and make their way up the towering snow-covered mountains. </p><p></p><p>Overall, mountaineering is a challenging and rewarding experience that tests individuals’ physical and mental abilities in some of the most beautiful natural environments in the world, making it a unique and exciting outdoor sport.</p><br />
