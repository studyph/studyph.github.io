She checked every pocket in her purse, but the key was nowhere to be found. She started to panic, realizing she must have lost it somewhere.</p><p></p><p><strong>Middle: </strong>Sara retraced her steps from work to home, but the key was nowhere to be found. She asked the security guard at work, but he hadn't seen it either. Sara spent the entire evening looking for the key, but she had no luck.</p><p>As night fell, Sara was getting desperate. She had no way to enter her home and had no spare key. She started to feel like she might have to spend the night outside when her neighbor, Mr. Johnson, approached her. "Is everything alright, Sara?" he asked.</p><p>Sara explained her situation, and Mr. Johnson offered to help. He had a spare key to Sara's house, and he kindly offered to let her stay at his place for the night. Sara was incredibly grateful for his kindness and accepted the offer.</p><p></p><p><strong>End:</strong> The next day, Sara found her lost key in the bottom of her purse, tucked away in a corner. She couldn't believe it had been there the whole time. Sara went over to Mr. Johnson's to thank him for his help and offer to pay him back for his kindness. Mr. Johnson simply smiled and told her it was no problem at all, and he was just happy to help. From that day on, Sara made sure to keep a spare key in a safe place, just in case she ever lost her key again.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1:it's a big term that encompasses just about every type of written word. It may be overwhelming to think about all the different types of literature, but there are actually two main groups all literature can be categorized under. These two categories are fiction and nonfiction. Fiction includes all written works that are invented or made-up by the author. This includes novels, short stories, and poems. Nonfiction, then, comprises of the written works based on real events. In this way, literature that is nonfiction can help us understand our world. Let's look closer at the characteristics and examples of nonfiction.</p><p>   </p><p>2: Most nonfiction works also have a similar author's purpose, which is the reason the author writes. Most nonfiction is written to express or to inform. If the author's purpose is to express, the concepts expressed are always based on true, real-life situations. Because of this, one could argue all nonfiction serves to inform the reader, as well.</p><p></p><p>3: The other type of nonfiction is informative nonfiction. The purpose of informative nonfiction is to explain or inform about a concept or situation. This type of nonfiction exists to provide the reader with factual information. Informative nonfiction includes articles and interviews.</p><p></p><p>4: The first is literary nonfiction, which includes nonfiction writing that reads like fiction. This means that literary nonfiction includes the elements of fiction, like characters, setting, and plot; however, in nonfiction these elements must be real and not imaginary. The stories are meant to amuse the reader, as well as inform on true stories. Literary nonfiction includes biographies, autobiographies, and essays.</p><p></p><p>5: There are many types of nonfiction examples in the world of literature. Remember, literary nonfiction includes works written like stories, but based on true events and people. All autobiographies and biographies fall into this category. Here are some well-known autobiographies and biographies:</p><br />
