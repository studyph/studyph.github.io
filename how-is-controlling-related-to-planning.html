                                            what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</a>

The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge."

                            4. what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Planning is an essential component of organizational success for several reasons. Firstly, it provides direction and focus for an organization by outlining specific goals and objectives that need to be achieved. This helps to ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently to meet those goals. Without planning, an organization may lack a clear sense of direction and may be unable to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, planning helps to anticipate and mitigate potential problems. By identifying potential risks and developing strategies to address them, an organization can proactively prepare for potential challenges and minimize their impact. Additionally, by regularly reviewing and updating plans, an organization can stay responsive to changes in its internal and external environment.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, planning enables an organization to make the best use of its resources. By identifying objectives, the required resources, the available resources and the gaps between the two, the management can focus on how to best use the resources available to achieve the objectives.</p><p></p><p>Controlling is related to planning in that it is used to ensure that the organization stays on track to achieve its goals and objectives. This includes monitoring progress towards goals, analyzing variances, and taking corrective action when necessary. By regularly measuring and evaluating performance against established goals and plans, an organization can identify and address issues that may be preventing it from achieving its objectives.</p><p></p><p>The different steps in planning are:</p><p></p><p>Setting Objectives: The first step in planning is to establish clear and measurable goals for the organization.</p><p></p><p>Situation Analysis: This step involves analyzing the internal and external factors that may affect the organization and its ability to achieve its objectives.</p><p></p><p>Strategy Formulation: Based on the situation analysis, the management formulate the strategy for achieving the objectives.</p><p></p><p>Implementation: After strategy has been formulated, the next step is to put the plans into action. This step involves developing detailed plans and allocating resources.</p><p></p><p>Monitoring and Control: This step involves monitoring the progress of plans and taking corrective action when necessary.</p><p></p><p>Review and Evaluation: After the completion of the plan, the management must evaluate the plan to see if the objectives have been achieved, and identify any areas that need improvement.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Planning is an essential component of organizational success as it provides direction, focus, help organizations anticipate and mitigate potential problems and make the best use of the resources. Controlling is related to planning as it ensures that the organization stays on track to achieve its goals and objectives.</p><br />

The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge."
