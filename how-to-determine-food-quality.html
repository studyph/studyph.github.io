Probably, the things that you would do would be: go out to buy food for your guests and prepare other things needed to make your guests feel at ease while in the comfort of your home. Before going out, you would probably count how many are your expected guests and list the things you would buy to determine your budget. When you’re at the supermarket, you would possibly compare the prices of different brands of food products or things you would buy to weigh which item is affordable yet it wouldn’t compromise the quality. *

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Make a list of all the ingredients in your product. Write down how much of each is in there. <p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Why nutritional values?</strong><p>When it comes to understanding food, nutrition is one of the most commonly discussed topics. What foods are good for me? What should I eat to live a long and healthy life? Good questions, that I believe no-one can fully answer for everyone (here’s a great article from the New York Times showing  just how we can all disagree).</p><strong>What is the nutritional value?</strong><p>Simply said, the nutritional value of foods tells you how much energy the food contains as well as which nutritional molecules are present in the food and how much. In reality, it’s nothing more than food chemistry &amp; chemical analysis: you determine which molecules are present and how many.</p><p></p><strong>Labeling the nutritional value</strong><p>Within the European Union there is legislation stating how and when the nutritional value should be labeled on food products. The labeling is regulated through the EU 1169/2011 directive. This is a very extensive piece of regulation on how food products should be labeled. The regulation defines things such as the name of products (e.g. you’re not allowed to call something ‘strawberry yogurt’ if it contains no strawberries), but also weight, shelf life dates, etc.</p><p></p><strong>Energy content</strong><p>The energy content can be determined using a simple calculation. We know which groups of molecules contribute to the energy content of a food. We also know how much energy each of these types of molecules contains and will give to your body.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#RXINBOW</p><br />

Probably, the things that you would do would be: go out to buy food for your guests and prepare other things needed to make your guests feel at ease while in the comfort of your home. Before going out, you would probably count how many are your expected guests and list the things you would buy to determine your budget. When you’re at the supermarket, you would possibly compare the prices of different brands of food products or things you would buy to weigh which item is affordable yet it wouldn’t compromise the quality. *
