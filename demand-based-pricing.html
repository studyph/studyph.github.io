                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We examined the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a junk food tax as an intervention to counter increasing obesity in North America.</p><p></p><p>Small excise taxes are likely to yield substantial revenue but are unlikely to affect obesity rates. High excise taxes are likely to have a direct impact on weight in at-risk populations but are less likely to be politically palatable or sustainable.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of earmarked health programs and subsidies is likely to be a key determinant of tax success in the fight against obesity.</p><p></p><p>In response to rapidly increasing obesity in North America, health researchers and policymakers are considering novel approaches to counter the growth of this epidemic.1 The divergence between energy intake and expenditure has widened since 1970,2 with a steady increase in daily calorie intake leading scientists and researchers to suggest targeting food consumption as a means of addressing the obesity epidemic. One such approach is now gaining momentum while generating heated debates in and outside the scientific community: a tax on unhealthy foods has been proposed to help reduce their consumption. We consider the implications of implementing 2 types of junk food tax (a nutrient tax and a food and beverage category tax) and provide an overview of arguments in favor of and against their institution. Ethical concerns must be considered along with the current state of scientific evidence about obesity and the efficacy of taxes for behavior change. We have identified significant knowledge gaps that provide direction for future research.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. These points are then graphed, and the line connecting them is the demand curve. The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>carry on learning</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>    Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay, you have no effective demand.</p><p>     What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded. An increase in the price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a decrease in price will increase the quantity demanded.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it's help po:)</p><br />
