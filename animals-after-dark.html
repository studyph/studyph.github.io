Scarystories can make the imagination run wild a On hot summer nights, Julio and the other boys sleep out in the yard. They put up a tent in a dark corner, where the trees and bushes are thick. That way the boys can easily imagine they are in wild, uninhabited country. One evening Mike suggested that they tell ghost stories or tales of bear hunts. After a particularly spine-tingling story, Mike couldn't sleep: he was too nervous. About midnight he saw something move in the shadows. "Yeow!" he cried out. "There is a big bear! It is really huge!" In the sudden confusion, the small tent collapsed on top of the boys each one seemed eager to go in a different direction. Anxious parents ran out of the nearby house. They found a coal-black dog. Like a bear, this animal was very curious. It was sniffing at the tangle arms, legs and bodies under the tent.​</a>

Scarystories can make the imagination run wild a On hot summer nights, Julio and the other boys sleep out in the yard. They put up a tent in a dark corner, where the trees and bushes are thick.

It is really huge!" In the sudden confusion, the small tent collapsed on top of the boys each one seemed eager to go in a different direction. Anxious parents ran out of the nearby house. They found a coal-black dog. Like a bear, this animal was very curious. It was sniffing at the tangle arms, legs and bodies under the tent.​</h2><br />
