Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</a>

They could also create a login page in their database system that only employee users with active company ID can access. Once its successfully implemented, the database system in the stolen laptop will automatically refresh and the latest database security and protection services will run smoothly and functions effectively. In this way, the theft could no longer access the database system of the company. For those clients whose information was compromised, I would suggest that the company should notify the police immediately and report the situation and note the potential risk for identity theft. Only then the police can help to contact those homeless victims through locating them to all possible clinics and homeless shelters, in order to restore their financial and health-related security.</p><br />

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy.

                            7. Case Analysis - Module 3 Instructions Instructions Case Analysis: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is one of the most popular attractions and a Top Zoo for Children Zoo for Children according to Parent’s Magazine. Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</h2><br />
