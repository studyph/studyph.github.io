                                            Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream. Below are the different flavors of ice cream we can choose from. What are the possible sets of flavors of ice cream we can have? teachin Vurpose only Not Butter Sale Chocolate Vanilla The table below lists the possible flavor or flavors of ice cream we can choose from the available flavors: If you chose None of the 3 flavors If we chose Any one chocolate Butter vanilla If you chose Any If we chose All three two chocolate, butter chocolate, butter, vanilla butter, vanilla chocolate, vanilla Using the table, illustrate the possible flavor or flavors of ice cream in a set: 1.

                            14. Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream. Below are the different flavors of ice cream we can choose from.

Let'sfind out how they emit light and what keeps them shining for a long time.please help me po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Stars shine because they are extremely hot (which is why fire gives off light — because it is hot). The source of their energy is nuclear reactions going on deep inside the stars. In most stars, like our sun, hydrogen is being converted into helium, a process which gives off energy that heats the star.<p></p><br />
