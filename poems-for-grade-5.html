RapNONSENECE ANSWER - REPORT ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals are entitled to the possession of their own existence and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.[2] Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term “animal rights” is often used synonymously with “animal protection” or “animal liberation”. More narrowly, “animal rights” refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals – rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.[3]</p><p></p><br />
