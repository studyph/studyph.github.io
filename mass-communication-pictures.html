                                            Part 1Unlike person to person communication, mass media communication iscommunicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicate sunde,without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds createvibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmittersbroadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio receiverThe cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receivesthe radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Televisionis communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameraschange light into electric currents. These currents are changed into patterns of light or videosignals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currentswhich are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals arecombined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antenna of yourTV sets receives television signals from different stations.

Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</a>

From Radio to Computer Part 1 Unlike person-to-person communication, modia communication communicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicato sounds without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds create vibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmitters broadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio recorvar. The cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receives the radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Television is communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameras change light into electric currents. These currents are changed into pattoms of light or video signals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currents which are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals are combined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antonna of your TV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TV innovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables. Cable TV is better since signals do not travel in the air. Part 2 The computer which has become a major communication device, utilizes electricity in the operation in the conversion and transmission of data through telephone wires. Communicating through computers is made possible by networks of computers owned by individuals, libraries, or any business establishments in almost all parts of the world. Through computer communication, electronic mail or e-mail, electronic shopping, electronic banking, and even electronic schooling is possible.

                            23. Part 1Unlike person to person communication, mass media communication iscommunicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicate sunde,without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds createvibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmittersbroadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio receiverThe cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receivesthe radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Televisionis communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameraschange light into electric currents. These currents are changed into patterns of light or videosignals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currentswhich are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals arecombined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antenna of yourTV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TVinnovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables, Cable TV is bettersince signals do not travel in the air. summarybeginning:main action or body:conclusion:​​</h2><br />

How did you come up with this kind of grouping?2. What common factors did you notice in the pictures in group 1 and 2?3. Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</h2><br />

                            30. mass D. Read the text below and be ready to give the summary. From Radio to Computer Part 1 Unlike person-to-person communication, modia communication communicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicato sounds without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds create vibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmitters broadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio recorvar. The cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receives the radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Television is communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameras change light into electric currents. These currents are changed into pattoms of light or video signals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currents which are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals are combined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antonna of your TV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TV innovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables. Cable TV is better since signals do not travel in the air. Part 2 The computer which has become a major communication device, utilizes electricity in the operation in the conversion and transmission of data through telephone wires. Communicating through computers is made possible by networks of computers owned by individuals, libraries, or any business establishments in almost all parts of the world. Through computer communication, electronic mail or e-mail, electronic shopping, electronic banking, and even electronic schooling is possible.
