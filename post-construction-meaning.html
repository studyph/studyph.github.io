Telling Time Humans have used different objects to tell time. In the beginning, they used an hourglass. This is a cylindrical glass with a narrow center which allows sand to flow from its upper to its lower portion. Once all the sand has trickled to the lower portion, one knows that an hour has passed. Using the same idea, water clocks were constructed to measure time by having water flow through a narrow passage from one container to another. On the other hand, sundials allowed people to estimate an hour by looking at the position of the shadow cast by the sun on a plate. At night, people measured time by checking the alignment of the stars in the sky. None of these were accurate, though. The clock was the first accurate instrument for telling time. 1. Which of the following ways of telling time made use of sand? (Literal) a. water clocks b. hourglass c. sundials d. clock 2. None of the clocks used long ago were accurate. Accurate in the sentence means (Inferential) a. free from error b. comparable c. very useful d. efficient 3. When men of long ago told time at night, they looked at to tell the time. (Literal) a. cloud formation b. moon c. stars d. sun 4. The sundials may not be useful in telling time. (Inferential) a. at noontime b. in the morning c. during a rainy day d. when the sun shines brightly 5. How are the hourglass and the water clock similar? (Inferential) a. Both tell time by the hour. b. Both use water to tell time. c. Both are used only in the daytime. d. Both have a narrow center through which something flows. 6. The best title of the selection is . . . (Critical) a. The Uses of Clocks b. Why People Need to Tell Time c. Ways of Telling Time: Then and Now d. Comparing the Different Types of Clocks 7. Which of these sentences is a topic sentence? (Critical) a. The invention of the clock 600 years ago was the first accurate measurement of time. b. Hourglass contained sand that fell through one container to another. c. Long ago people used simple tools such as the hour glass. d. Humans have used different objects to tell the time. B. Counting the Hours When men decided to divide the day into twenty-four hours, they used numbers one through twelve two times. As a result, there was one o’clock during the day and another one o’clock after midnight. This created confusion. If one was told to submit a project at six o’clock, did this mean six o’clock in the morning or at night? The Romans provided a solution to this problem. They thought that noon time, the time when the sun is at its apex, is an important time. They called noon Meridies and measured time by this. They called the morning ante meridiem, which means “before noon” while “after noon” was called post meridiem. Ante meridiem was shortened to A.M. while post meridiem was shortened to P.M. 8.	When the day was divided into twenty-four hours, what numbers were used to express time? (Literal) a. one to six b. one to twelve c. one to thirty-six d. one to twenty four 9. Having one number to express time twice caused confusion. In this selection confusion may mean. . .(Inferential) a. differences b. discussions c. problems d. mistakes 10. The Romans thought of a solution. This means that they provider . (Inferential) a. an answer to the problem b. a better interpretation c. a new set of numbers d. another clock 11. Meridies means ___ (Literal) a. apex b. noon c. before d. daylight 12. The early Romans used the position of the sun to tell the time. When the sun was at its apex, it was noon. What does apex mean? a. highest point b. lowest point c. farthest point d. nearest point 13. Another good title for this selection . . . Critical) a. Why There Are Twenty-Four Hours in a Day b. Why Noontime is Important to Romans c. How the Romans Told Time d. The Meaning of A.M. and P.M.​</a>

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing a range of illnesses, from the common cold to more serious infections such as those caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus can also cause a variety of diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets.​</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Three Ways of Explaining a Concept <p></p><p><strong>1. Definition </strong>- is the method of identifying a given term and making its meaning clearer. It can be presented in three ways </p><p>i. Formal – explains a term to be defined, category and details </p><p>Example: Vitamin E is a light yellow fat- soluble vitamins that acts an anti- oxidant. </p><p>ii. Informal – is done through a parenthetical or brief explanation </p><p>Example : Tocopherol ( Vitamin E ) is naturally found in vegetable oil, fish and nuts </p><p>iii. Extended – a detailed way of defining and term and usually composed of at least one paragraph ( formal and informal, comparison and contrast, narration, description , etc.) </p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Explication</strong>- is a method of explanation in which sentences, verses, quotes or passages are taken from a literary or academic work and then interpreted and explained in a detailed way </p><p>Example: The poem titled “ The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost is about a man reflecting on a choice he had once made. While the outcome of his choice is not implied to be positive or negative the speaker notes that the choice in itself and the consequences of that choice have made a huge difference in a way his life is unfolded.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. Clarification </strong>- is a method of explanation in which the points are organized from a general abstract idea to specific and concrete examples </p><p>Example: </p><p>Justice is a broad concept which encompasses a wide set of ideas , most of which also branch out into similar notions. For instance, it can refer to the sentencing of criminal based on due process. When an individual gets what he deserves outside the hands of the law, it is also considered justice in some contexts.</p><p></p><p>You can visit the following page to know the meaning of Speech:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11481300</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />

Telling Time Humans have used different objects to tell time. In the beginning, they used an hourglass. This is a cylindrical glass with a narrow center which allows sand to flow from its upper to its lower portion. Once all the sand has trickled to the lower portion, one knows that an hour has passed. Using the same idea, water clocks were constructed to measure time by having water flow through a narrow passage from one container to another. On the other hand, sundials allowed people to estimate an hour by looking at the position of the shadow cast by the sun on a plate. At night, people measured time by checking the alignment of the stars in the sky. None of these were accurate, though. The clock was the first accurate instrument for telling time. 1. Which of the following ways of telling time made use of sand? (Literal) a. water clocks b. hourglass c. sundials d. clock 2. None of the clocks used long ago were accurate. Accurate in the sentence means (Inferential) a. free from error b. comparable c. very useful d. efficient 3. When men of long ago told time at night, they looked at to tell the time. (Literal) a. cloud formation b. moon c. stars d. sun 4. The sundials may not be useful in telling time. (Inferential) a. at noontime b. in the morning c. during a rainy day d. when the sun shines brightly 5. How are the hourglass and the water clock similar? (Inferential) a. Both tell time by the hour. b. Both use water to tell time. c. Both are used only in the daytime. d. Both have a narrow center through which something flows. 6.

Counting the Hours When men decided to divide the day into twenty-four hours, they used numbers one through twelve two times. As a result, there was one o’clock during the day and another one o’clock after midnight. This created confusion. If one was told to submit a project at six o’clock, did this mean six o’clock in the morning or at night? The Romans provided a solution to this problem. They thought that noon time, the time when the sun is at its apex, is an important time. They called noon Meridies and measured time by this. They called the morning ante meridiem, which means “before noon” while “after noon” was called post meridiem. Ante meridiem was shortened to A.M. while post meridiem was shortened to P.M. 8.
