Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions Our carbon dioxide emissions are 0 4% of the global totalWe are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed-the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it We must as global citizens, address this problem actively.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lets’s discuss these 10 best ways to reduce air pollution.</p><p></p><p>1. Using public transports</p><p></p><p>Using public transport is a sure short way of contributing to less air pollution as it provides with less gas and energy, even carpools contribute to it. In addition to less release of fuels and gas, using a public transport can also help in saving money.</p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>2. Turn off the lights when not in use</p><p></p><p>The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.</p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>3. Recycle and Reuse</p><p></p><p>The concept of recycle and reuse is not just conserve resources and use them judicially but also is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. The recycled products also take less power to make other products.</p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>4. No to plastic bags</p><p></p><p>The use of plastic products could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to decompose, due to their material made up of oil. The use of paper bags instead is a better alternative as they decompose easily and are recyclable.</p><p></p><p>5. Reduction of forest fires and smoking</p><p></p><p>The collecting of garbage and getting it on fire in dry seasons or dry leaves catching fires is a huge factor for causing air pollution, moreover smoking also causes air pollution and causes the air quality to worsen along with obviously damaging one’s health.</p><p></p><p>6. Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner</p><p></p><p>The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.</p><p></p><p>7. Use filters for chimneys</p><p></p><p>The gas that is emitted from fireplaces in homes and factories are extremely dangerous for air pollution and harms the air quality severely. The use of filters should be used at least if the consumption couldn’t be lessened, this will help to reduce the effect of harmful gases absorbing in the air.</p><p></p><p>8. Avoid usage of crackers</p><p></p><p>The use of crackers during festivals and weddings is sadly one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, leading to a layer of smog which is extremely harmful for health. So, practice of no crackers should be implemented.</p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>9. Avoid using of products with chemicals</p><p></p><p>Products that use the chemicals in their usage or smell strongly, like paints or perfumes should be used less or outside the house. There can also be an alternative to use products with low chemical content and organic properties.</p><p></p><p>10. Implement Afforestation</p><p></p><p>Last but not the least, plant and grow as many trees as possible. The practice of planting trees provides a lot of benefits to the environment and helps with the release of oxygen.</p><p>Also Read: 7 Things to Avoid During Air Pollution in Delhi</p><p>Wear a good N95 mask while you are in outside enviroment to protect from the pollution</p><p></p><br />

                            22. Nowadays, some types of animals are considered endangered species. This means
there are few animals of that kind left in the wild or in captivity. One problem is animals lost
their natural habitat because of humans. As the human population increases, more and
more spaces are needed for building construction. It pushes the animals to move away from
their natural habitat. Forest and swamp are the most threatened since more trees are cut
down to build more homes.
Task: For more than a decade of your life, as you observe the environmental changes
happening in our country, can you cite three more examples that demonstrate how the
change in human population affects the population of other species in an ecosystem.
Example: The higher the human population, the greater demand for animal meat.

                        <p>Natural science and social science can work interdependently because they study different aspects of the natural world and human society, respectively. Natural science seeks to understand the physical and biological world through empirical observation and experimentation, while social science seeks to understand human behavior, culture, and society through systematic study and analysis.</p><p></p><p>One example of a problem that can be addressed by both fields is climate change. Natural science can study the physical processes that contribute to climate change, such as changes in the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Social science, on the other hand, can study the social and economic factors that drive human behavior and influence policy decisions related to climate change, such as energy consumption patterns, political ideologies, and the distribution of economic resources.</p><p></p><p>For instance, social scientists can investigate the attitudes and behaviors of people towards climate change and identify the factors that hinder or facilitate climate action. They can also examine how policy interventions and technological innovations can promote sustainable practices and mitigate the impact of climate change. Meanwhile, natural scientists can provide data and insights on the physical and biological effects of climate change on ecosystems, human health, and global economies.</p><p></p><p>By working together, natural and social scientists can develop comprehensive solutions to address the complex and interconnected challenges of climate change. They can also help policymakers and communities make informed decisions and take effective action towards a more sustainable future.</p><br />

                            24. Section 2 - The right of the people to be secured in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall be issued except upon problem cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. example​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The purpose of a preliminary investigation is only to determine probable cause. As stressed in Hashmin vs. Boncan, 71 Phil. 216, January 31, 1931 ". . . the investigating judge or prosecuting officer acts upon probable cause and reasonable belief, not upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The occasion is not for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence; it is for the presentation of such evidence only as may engender well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof. When all this is fulfilled, the accused will not be permitted to cast about for fancied reasons to delay the proceeding; the time to task for more is at the trial.</p><p></p><p>xxx xxx xxx</p><p></p><p>2. Both under the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, the settled rulings of our jurisprudence, which rulings the drafters of the 1987 Constitution were certainly cognizant of and took into consideration, is that the judge, in the determination of the existence of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant of arrest, may rely upon the certification of the fiscal that he has conducted a preliminary investigation and that a probable cause exists. (See Hashmin vs. Boncan, supra; and Placer vs. Villanueva, 126 SCRA 463, citing U.S. vs. Ocampo, 18 Phil. 1 and Amarga vs. Abbas, 98 Phil. 739).</p><p></p><p>3. The insertion of the word "personally" for the judge's determination of the existence of probable cause in the 1987 Constitution serves to underscore the exclusive and personal responsibility of the issuing judge to satisfy himself of the existence of a probable cause. He is prescribed from delegating this task of investigation to any other person. He must do it personally.</p><p></p><p>4. In satisfying himself of the existence of a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the judge, following the established doctrine and procedure, may either:</p><p></p><p>(a) Rely upon the fiscal's certification of the existence of probable cause whether or not the case is cognizable only by the Regional Trial Court and on the basis thereof, issue a warrant of arrest; or</p><p></p><p>(b) If on the face of the information he finds no probable cause, he may disregard the fiscal's certification and require the submission of the supporting affidavits of witnesses to aid him in arriving at a conclusion as to the existence of a probable cause.</p><p></p><p>5. The Supreme Court admonition should be heeded that while the Constitutions does confer upon the judge the power to conduct preliminary examination preparatory to issuing a warrant of arrest, sound policy reasons should curb the propensity to make use of such competence, since judges of the CFI and CCC (now RTC) "should not encumber themselves with the preliminary examination and investigation of criminal complaints" but should "concentrate on hearing and deciding criminal cases filed before their courts." (Collector of Customs vs. Villaluz and five other cases jointly decided, 71 SCRA 356 [1976]).</p><br />
