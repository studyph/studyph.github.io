                        The domains of learning were first developed and described between 1956-1972. The ones discussed here are usually attributed to their primary author, even though the actual development may have had more authors in its formal, complete citation (see full citations below). Some web references attribute all of the domains to Benjamin Bloom which is simply not true. While Bloom was involved in describing both the cognitive and the affective domains, he appeared as first author on the cognitive domain. As a result this bore his name for years and was commonly known among educators as Bloom’s Taxonomy even though his colleague David Krathwohl also a partner on the 1956 publication. When publishing the description of the affective domain in 1964 Krathwohl was named as first author, but Bloom also worked on developing this work. Krathwohl’s involvement in the development of the cognitive domain will be become important when you look at the authors of the 2001 revisions to this taxonomy.<br /><br />Sana makatulong..<br />
