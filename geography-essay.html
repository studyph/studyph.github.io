                        Geography is divided into two main branches: human geography and physical geography. Human Geography is one of the major branches in geography and it mainly covers studies of the human race. This normally involves understanding a human population’s backgrounds, how the interactions and the perceptions that members of that human population have for various ideologies affecting them.<br /><br />While Physical Geography is a major branch of the science of geography, and it mainly deals with the study of the natural characteristics of the Earth.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society that spans across the globe. With the advancements in technology, communication, and transportation, the world has become more interconnected, and global culture has emerged. It encompasses various aspects of human life, such as language, art, music, food, fashion, and sports, among others. Global culture has also brought about cultural diffusion, whereby different cultures interact and share their practices, resulting in new hybrid cultures.</p><p>Tourism geography, on the other hand, refers to the study of the geographical distribution and patterns of tourism, including its social, economic, and environmental impacts. The tourism industry has grown significantly over the years, and it has become a crucial part of many countries' economies. It involves people traveling to different destinations for leisure, business, or other purposes. Tourism geography helps to understand the factors that influence tourist behavior, such as the natural attractions, cultural heritage, infrastructure, and transportation networks of different destinations.</p><p>Global culture and tourism geography are intertwined. Global culture has contributed to the growth of the tourism industry by creating a demand for travel and exploration of different cultures. People travel to experience new cultures, taste different foods, and witness diverse lifestyles. Tourism, in turn, has also influenced global culture by promoting the exchange of ideas, customs, and traditions between different societies. Global culture and tourism geography continue to evolve, driven by the changing preferences of tourists and the constant exchange of cultural practices.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Geography is the study of the earth, its physical features, and the human activities that take place on it. Human beings have used their knowledge of geography to develop their cultures for centuries. The study of geography has been essential in understanding the world around us, how it works, and how human beings can adapt and live in it.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant contributions of geography to human culture is the understanding of the environment. Humans have always interacted with the environment, and geography has provided us with the knowledge of how to do so sustainably. Through studying geography, we learn about the climate, the natural resources, and the physical features of the land we live on. This knowledge helps us make informed decisions on how to use the environment without degrading it. For example, understanding the geography of a region helps us determine which crops grow best in that area, and how to cultivate them in a way that does not harm the soil.</p><p></p><p>Geography has also played a significant role in the development of human societies. The study of geography has helped us understand how physical features like mountains, rivers, and oceans have affected human settlements and migration patterns. Through geography, we can also understand how different societies developed and evolved over time. For example, the geography of Europe has played a significant role in the development of its various cultures and languages.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, geography has contributed to the development of international relations. The study of geography has helped nations understand their neighbors better, the resources they possess, and the trade routes they can use. This knowledge has been used to foster international trade, which has been essential in the development of human societies.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of geography has been instrumental in the development of human culture. Through geography, we have gained knowledge of the environment, human settlements, and international relations, which have been essential in building our societies. As the world continues to evolve, the study of geography will continue to play a vital role in shaping human culture.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>     A SHORT DEFINITION FOR CULTURAL          GEOGRAPHY<p></p><p></p><p>    The study of the relationship between culture and place. In broad terms, cultural geography examines the cultural values, practices, discursive and material expressions and artefacts of people, the cultural diversity and plurality of society, and how cultures are distributed over space, how places and identities are produced, how people make sense of places and build senses of place, and how people produce and communicate knowledge and meaning. Cultural geography has long been a core component of the discipline of geography, though how it has been conceived, its conceptual tools, and the approach to empirical research has changed quite markedly over time.</p><p></p><p>   Cultural geography sought to compare and contrast different cultures around the world and their relationship to natural environments. This approach has its roots in the anthropogeography of Friedrich Ratzel and, in common with anthropology, it aimed to understand cultural practices, social organizations, and indigenous knowledges, but gave emphasis to people’s connections with and use of place and nature. </p><p></p><p>   While this form of cultural geography is still practised, it was challenged in the 1980s by new thinking that created what has been termed ‘new cultural geography’, which led to a broader cultural turn in the discipline. During this period, cultural geographers started to engage with new theoretical ideas within social theory, including humanism, structuralism, post-structuralism, postmodernism, and post-colonialism, recasting cultural geography in a number of significant ways. Most crucially, culture itself was conceived as a fluid, flexible, and dynamic process that actively constructs society, rather than simply reflecting it.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of new cultural geography, landscape was not simply a material artefact that reflected culture in straightforward ways, but was laden with symbolic meaning that needed to be decoded with respect to social and historical context, using new techniques such as iconography. Similarly, it was contended that other cultural practices, artefacts, and representations needed to be theorized and analysed in much more contextual, contingent, and relational ways, sensitive to the workings of difference and power. Here, new cultural geographers argued that cultural identities are not essentialized and teleological, but rather need to be understood as constitutive of complex power geometries giving rise to all kinds of hydridity and diversity </p><p></p><p>      Consequently, cultural geography is one of the most vibrant fields in human geography today</p><p></p><p>   </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p> Sana po naka tulong :3 lagi daw po maliSana po naka tulong :3 lagi daw po malicorrect me if i wrong po<br />

                            30. why do the "twin subjects" of physical geography and human geography complement the study of geography?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Geography is the study of the Earth's lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena. It is a broad field that incorporates many different sub-fields and disciplines, including physical geography and human geography.</p><p></p><p>Physical geography is concerned with the natural features and processes of the Earth, such as landforms, climates, soils, and vegetation. It focuses on the physical characteristics of the environment and how they have been shaped by natural forces such as plate tectonics, weather, and climate.</p><p></p><p>Human geography, on the other hand, is focused on the human elements of the environment, such as population, culture, economic activities, and political organization. It examines how humans have interacted with and changed the environment, and how these interactions have shaped human societies and cultures.</p><p></p><p>Together, physical and human geography provide a comprehensive understanding of the Earth and its inhabitants. Physical geography provides a foundation for understanding the natural environment, while human geography sheds light on how humans have interacted with and altered that environment. By combining these two sub-fields, geographers can gain a more complete picture of the Earth and its inhabitants.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.
