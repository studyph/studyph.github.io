                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>8.The larynx, commonly called the voice box or glottis, is the passageway for air between the pharynx above and the trachea below. ... The larynx plays an essential role in human speech. During sound production, the vocal cords close together and vibrate as air expelled from the lungs passes between them.</p><p>9.Bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called alveoli, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide actually takes place. Each person has hundreds of millions of alveoli in their lungs.</p><p>10.The lungs and respiratory system allow oxygen in the air to be taken into the body, while also letting the body get rid of carbon dioxide in the air breathed out.</p><br />
