                                            The 'Singa'Sang Nila Utama an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong BentamWhen the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heartSuddenly a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only grazing the animal The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing)The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but uponreaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it andlooked at the land and the sea spread out around him in the distance he saw a stretch of white sand- anislandSang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He tumed to one of his subjects who hadfollowed him"What is the name of that island?"The subject looked into the distance and smiled"That is Ternasek, Your Highness""Then we are going thereThe king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island.Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds heavy rain poured from them and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm The crew lowered the sails, started to ball the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning However, an idea came to the king's head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of howone of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to hisancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the seaAll at once the storm broke As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of TemasekWhen the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle"What sort of animal was that? the king asked.A wise old man stepped forth"I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West Perhaps this is a 'singa but I wonder how he got "This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here. here in the island ofall the way here.Singapura.(Singa- The word "singa is actually the Malay word for lion" Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referredto as the "Lion City ")Who was Sang Nila Utama?

3. Using the evolutionary trees in this chapter, compare the following
groups. For each comparison, what features are similar among the
groups? What features are different?
(a) Compare cnidarians to sponges and to the clade containing flawan
mollusks, and annelids.
(b) Compare flatworms to cnidarians, other protostomes, and deuterostar
(c) Compare mollusks to flatworms and annelids.
(d) Compare nematodes to other protostomes in general and to arthry

(e) Compare echinoderms to protostomes and to chordates.
4. List the criteria used to distinguish: (a) animals from other organisms
(b) vertebrates from invertebrates; (c) protostomes from deuterostomes
(d) ectotherms from endotherms.

You can research on the internet or read articles related to this issue so that you can arrive at a comprehensive report. Question: Should people ban the use of plastic bags? Benefits of Using Disposal Plastic Bags Burdens Brought by Using Disposable Plastic Bags - easy to carry - durable and water proof - reusable - more useful in bad weather faster and easier to open and pack less prone to tearing Unhealthy for the planet (if not properly disposed of, can be devastating to animal life) Can cause pollution in water and land Contaminate food sources Non-renewable The poisonous gaseous product produced by the decomposition can cause cancer Hard to recycle Take up to 1000 years to decompose Which point of view do you agree with?

Smokes by cars and factories, had a possibility of acid rain. Killing animals. if we continue to kill animals they will be extinct, we will not have food.

                            5. The 'Singa'Sang Nila Utama an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong BentamWhen the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heartSuddenly a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only grazing the animal The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing)The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but uponreaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it andlooked at the land and the sea spread out around him in the distance he saw a stretch of white sand- anislandSang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He tumed to one of his subjects who hadfollowed him"What is the name of that island?"The subject looked into the distance and smiled"That is Ternasek, Your Highness""Then we are going thereThe king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island.Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds heavy rain poured from them and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm The crew lowered the sails, started to ball the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning However, an idea came to the king's head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of howone of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to hisancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the seaAll at once the storm broke As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of TemasekWhen the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle"What sort of animal was that? the king asked.A wise old man stepped forth"I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West Perhaps this is a 'singa but I wonder how he got "This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here. here in the island ofall the way here.Singapura.(Singa- The word "singa is actually the Malay word for lion" Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referredto as the "Lion City ")Who was Sang Nila Utama?
