(see attached rubric on page 13) Instructions: Write a mini research about a topic of your interest. Make sure that the topic you have chosen has available data that can be analyzed and interpreted. Please be guided using this format. □ PROBLEM - A problem statement is a statement of a current issue or problem that requires timely action to improve the situation. Ex. What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated. RECOMMENDATION - Recommendations are based on the results of your research and indicate the specific measures or direction that can be taken. Note : This will be recorded as PERFORMANCE TASK .

(see attached rubric on page 13) Instructions: Write a mini research about a topic of your interest. Make sure that the topic you have chosen has available data that can be analyzed and interpreted. Please be guided using this format. □ PROBLEM - A problem statement is a statement of a current issue or problem that requires timely action to improve the situation. Ex. What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated. RECOMMENDATION - Recommendations are based on the results of your research and indicate the specific measures or direction that can be taken. Note : This will be recorded as PERFORMANCE TASK .
