                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.</p><p></p><p>Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.</p><p></p><p>Education was carried at homes for centuries. There were not schools. Teachers were hired for wealthy people. The poor could not afford for teachers so their children did not take any education. The most people were illiterate. Then appeared voices that more education could improving life of all class of society. So schools were established, but education at home was still popular at wealthier homes. Both school and education at home have some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p></p><p>Teaching children at home gives them more opportunity to understand any subject. All attention is paying to one pupil and every question is answered. There is no possibility to cheat or be unprepared to lesson. Students could develop their interesting in any subject very easily. This is the better way to be very good prepared for every exam. But, in general, this is the most expensive way to have well educated child. Children, who are educated alone, have less friends and colleagues, are more selfish and could have difficulties in adult life.</p><p></p><p>School, again in general, is reasonably cheaper than home education. There is less attention for one pupil but among more children is some kind of rivalry. Students learn because want to be better than friend or colleague. They meet more people so their life is more civilized. Friendship for all life starts very often in school. Adult life has less mysteries for them than for children educated at homes. However there are more violence, more opportunity to meet bad company and finally end school without any education.</p><p></p><p>In conclude, school has more advantages because not only teach, but also socialize pupils. And for parenting two of the most important subjects are good education and good breeding. It is the best preparing for adult life.</p><p></p><br />

                            24. write 3 paragraph about allowing cellular phone in school​</h2><br />
                        Introduction: <br /><br />Cellular phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and students are no exception. The debate about whether or not to allow cell phones in schools has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that cell phones should be banned in schools, others argue that they should be allowed. In this essay, I will argue that allowing cellular phones in school can have several benefits.  <br /><br />Body Paragraph 1: One of the main reasons why cell phones should be allowed in schools is that they can be used as a tool for learning. With the advancement of technology, students can access a wealth of information on their phones. For example, they can use their phones to research topics, access educational apps, and even take notes during class. According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, 73% of teachers believe that cell phones can be used as a learning tool in the classroom (Anderson &amp; Perrin, 2017). Therefore, allowing cell phones in schools can enhance the learning experience for students.  <br /><br />Body Paragraph 2: Another reason why cell phones should be allowed in schools is that they can be used in case of emergencies. In the event of a school shooting, natural disaster, or any other emergency situation, students can use their phones to call for help or to contact their parents. According to a study conducted by the National School Safety and Security Services, 97% of schools allow students to bring cell phones to school for emergency purposes (National School Safety and Security Services, 2019). Therefore, allowing cell phones<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you can bring a cellular phone to school because</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1) Parental contact. The amount of time it takes to reach a parent during an emergency can be significantly reduced if the child has a cell phone. Finding “Mom” or “Dad” listed on their contact list and making the call from the site of the emergency would be much quicker than having to notify the teacher or office and having them look the information up in their system.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2) Emergencies. If there is an emergency at school that would require calling the police, fire or ambulance services the response time is much shorter for an observing student to use their cell phone rather than finding one at the school.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3) School closures. If there is a weather related emergency, and the school needs to close ,it would be a lot less hassle for the school, if the students could contact their parents themselves. It would be much faster than standing in line at a school phone or the secretary having to make calls or activate a calling tree.</p><br />

                        <p>There are many causes of bullying in our society. Many school kids who bully others often do so in order to show their dominance to others and to raise their social status.  They may have a high self-esteem and they may show little regret or sorrow for their bullying behaviour, as they do not see bullying as a wrong act. Others may bully out of frustration and anger as they may socially struggle or they could have been a victim of bullying themselves and feel that bullying others helps them regain themselves as a person.</p><p>Bullying can affect everyone in different ways depending on the person them self, how they are being bullied and how they attempt to resolve what is happening.
