                            22. Reagent is a fancy word for the main ingredients of any chemical-based test, which in this pandemic includes inorganic solutions as well as enzymes, probes, and primers created to match the corona-virus genome. They are the tip of testing spear in the fight against the coronavirus, to know if one is positive or negative and this is very important to the people in the community-local or international. What will happen if there is a shortage of chemical reagent used to testcoronavirus? How this will affect the individuals and the community?Please answer the questions on the space provided below or on thepaper.Answer_____________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>It's a fancy word for the main ingredients of any chemical-based test, which in this pandemic includes inorganic solutions as well as enzymes, probes, and primers created to match the coronavirus's genome.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>And they are a necessity for the coronavirus test kits that are vital to combating COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease that by April 18 had killed more than 156,000 of its 2.2 million confirmed sufferers since the coronavirus jumped to humans in central China in November.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The importance of reagents will continue to outstrip supplies in many places as the race for safe and effective vaccines and treatment continue and governments embrace "testing, testing, testing" while they try to lead billions of people out of the great lockdown.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But for all their durability in a vial, the COVID-19 crisis has underscored our vulnerability to reagent shortages brought on by sudden demand, export bans, and stockpiling. Their scarcity is compounded by problems like limited production capacity and a market dominated by just a few firms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:)</strong></p><p>NOT SUREEEEE</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
