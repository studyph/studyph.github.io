                                            3.This paper considers the nature of professional learning arising through theprocesses of carrying out action research in professional organizations. Itsuggests that communicative space opened up outside of the professionalcontext can lead to unanticipated professional learning. Such learning could beconsidered transformative in the way it leads professionals to reframe theirunderstanding of the dilemma arising from doing action research. To illustratethis, two cases are presented to show the pivotal role university tutors can playnot only in the way they create and maintain communicative space but also inthe way they purposefully employ strategies to interrupt and challengeviewpoints, assumptions, and practices held by professionals doing actionresearch, enabling professional learning to become transformative.Main idea:​</a>

Interactive model supports the idea that there is a never-ending process of communication and feedback when communicators exchange messages in role-switching manner. 2. Communication models describe how the process of communication, show relationship among variables and help find and repair problems in communication. 3. When a person is not physically feeling well, he may not be able to grasp the message that you are telling him. 4. Transactional model shows the important roles of the sender and receivers as communicators as they reverse roles. 5. As a new teacher with a dialect different to her, Reez had to learn and understand the accent of her students so it would be easy for her to reach out to them. What she did was right. 6. If I allow my own perspectives on things to get in my way to learning, I am blocking the chance to learn new things from other people. 7. Wilbur Schramm believes on the commonality of experience between sender and receiver. 8. Helical Model of Communication is an example of Transactional Model of communication. 9. Distance between two people may also become a barrier to communication. 10. Listening attentively to the speaker can help solve communication breakdown.​</a>

                                            1. This paper considers the nature of professional learning arising through the processes of carrying out action research in professional organizations. It suggests that communicative space opened up outside of the professional context can lead to anticipated professional learning. Such learning can be considered transformative in the way it leads professionals to refrain their understanding of the dilemma arising from doing action research. To illustrate this, two cases are presented to show the pivotal role university tutors can play not only in the way they create and maintain communicative space but also in the way they purposefully employ strategies to interrupt and challenge viewpoints, assumptions, and practices held by professionals doing action research, enabling professional learning to become transformative.

                                            ACTIVITY 4. READ AND LEARNLESSON 2. NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONThe term communication comes from the Latin word ‘communicare’,which means to share, impart, participate, exchange, transmit or to makecommon. As defined by Steven McCornack in his book titled “InterpersonalCommunication and You,“ communication is a process of sharing andconveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures. In order for you to betterunderstand communication, you have to take a closer look to its nature. Asyou explore its nature, you will come across the following features:Communication is a PROCESS.Communication is a process in which a source/speaker sends andencodes a message through a channel to a destination/receiver. The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-way – there is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language. These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other​</a>

You transform and adapt to suit the needs of the moment. It is important to note that those are forms of communication strategy to avoid misunderstanding and communication breakdown. This time around, you will explore the reasons why people communicate in specific ways. In the succeeding activities, you will have a chance to explore different situations to learn the various functions of communication and their relevance to your daily interactions with people. By observing how people communicate, you will find out what type of approach works best in a communicative scenario. In the process, it is with high hopes that this self-paced learning module can help you become a more effective communicator wherever you may go and in whatever situation you may be.Question:Observe how do people communicate, write your answer using two or more sentence.auto report if wrong answer:;;)​</a>

                                            Mathematics is one subject that pervades life at any age and in any circumstance. Thus, its value goes beyond the classroom and the school. Mathematics
as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
Geometry, Patterns and Algebra, and Probability and Statistic..</a>

Itsuggests that communicative space opened up outside of the professionalcontext can lead to unanticipated professional learning. Such learning could beconsidered transformative in the way it leads professionals to reframe theirunderstanding of the dilemma arising from doing action research. To illustratethis, two cases are presented to show the pivotal role university tutors can playnot only in the way they create and maintain communicative space but also inthe way they purposefully employ strategies to interrupt and challengeviewpoints, assumptions, and practices held by professionals doing actionresearch, enabling professional learning to become transformative.Main idea:​</h2><br />

                            15. 1. This paper considers the nature of professional learning arising through the processes of carrying out action research in professional organizations. It suggests that communicative space opened up outside of the professional context can lead to anticipated professional learning. Such learning can be considered transformative in the way it leads professionals to refrain their understanding of the dilemma arising from doing action research. To illustrate this, two cases are presented to show the pivotal role university tutors can play not only in the way they create and maintain communicative space but also in the way they purposefully employ strategies to interrupt and challenge viewpoints, assumptions, and practices held by professionals doing action research, enabling professional learning to become transformative.

                            16. ACTIVITY 4. READ AND LEARNLESSON 2. NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONThe term communication comes from the Latin word ‘communicare’,which means to share, impart, participate, exchange, transmit or to makecommon. As defined by Steven McCornack in his book titled “InterpersonalCommunication and You,“ communication is a process of sharing andconveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures. In order for you to betterunderstand communication, you have to take a closer look to its nature. Asyou explore its nature, you will come across the following features:Communication is a PROCESS.Communication is a process in which a source/speaker sends andencodes a message through a channel to a destination/receiver. The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-way – there is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language. These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other​</h2><br />

                            23. You might not have noticed, but every time you communicate with people around you, your manner of speaking, your tone of voice, and even your choice of words largely depend on the context and the person or people you are talking to. You transform and adapt to suit the needs of the moment. It is important to note that those are forms of communication strategy to avoid misunderstanding and communication breakdown. This time around, you will explore the reasons why people communicate in specific ways. In the succeeding activities, you will have a chance to explore different situations to learn the various functions of communication and their relevance to your daily interactions with people. By observing how people communicate, you will find out what type of approach works best in a communicative scenario.

as a school subject, therefore, must be learned comprehensively and with much depth.
The twin goals of mathematics in the basic education levels, K-10, are Critical Thinking and Problem Solving.
Critical thinking, according to Scriven and Paul (1987) is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.
On the other hand, according to Polya (1945 &amp; 1962), mathematical problem solving is finding a way around a difficulty, around an obstacle, and finding a solution to a
problem that is unknown.
These two goals are to be achieved with an organized and rigorous curriculum content, a well-defined set of high-level skills and processes, desirable values and
attitudes, and appropriate tools, taking into account the different contexts of Filipino learners.
There are five content areas in the curriculum, as adopted from the framework prepared by MATHTED &amp; SEI (2010): Numbers and Number Sense, Measurement,
