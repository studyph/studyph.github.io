                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Writing the Analysis of a Poem, Short Story, or Play</p><p>Overview</p><p>The opening assignment in this literature-themed writing course is the analysis of the single poem, story, novel, or play. This assignment will form the basis of most of the other writing assignments you will be required to undertake in your Writ 102 literature class. It is important that you know how to write an analysis—sometimes called an interpretation or a literary analysis or a critical reading or a critical analysis in order to identify an author’s or text’s main idea through the process of explication. To understand what is required in your analysis, be certain to first familiarize yourself with the Analysis assignment and read Edward Hirsch’s “How to Read a Poem.”</p><p></p><p>How to Structure An Analysis Essay</p><p>There is no one single method for structuring your analysis. In fact, there are several equally valid ways of structuring a literary analysis. What takes time and effort is discovering the best method for your purpose and audience, and the methods presented here are easy enough to modify to fit those needs.</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Presenting the Main Idea</p><p>Regardless of what method you use, it is always sound to begin your analysis with a paragraph that provides the context of the work you are analyzing and a brief account of what you believe to be the poem or story or play’s main theme. At a minimum, your account of the work’s context will include the name of the author, the title of the work, its genre, and the date and place of publication. If there is an important biographical or historical context to the work, you should include that, as well. However, don’t get lost in details. Your audience except a concise (meaning short) level of background. Next, try to express the work’s theme in one or two sentences. Theme is that insight into human experience the author offers to readers, usually revealed as the content, the drama, the plot of the poem, story, or play unfolds and the characters interact. Assessing theme can be a complex task. Authors usually show the theme; they don’t tell it. They rarely say, at the end of the story, words to this effect: “and the moral of my story is…” They tell their story, develop their characters, provide some kind of conflict—and from all of this theme emerges. Because identifying theme can be challenging and subjective, it is often a good idea to work through the rest of the analysis, then return to the beginning and assess theme in light of your analysis of the work’s other literary elements.</p><p></p><p>Example Introduction Paragraph</p><p>Here is a good example of an introductory paragraph from Ben’s analysis of William Butler Yeats’ poem, “Among School Children.”</p><p></p><p>“Among School Children” was published in Yeats’ 1928 collection of poems The Tower. It was inspired by a visit Yeats made in 1926 to school in Waterford, an official visit in his capacity as a senator of the Irish Free State. In the course of the tour, Yeats reflects upon his own youth and the experiences that shaped the “sixty-year old, smiling public man” (line 8) he has become. Through his reflection, the theme of the poem emerges: a life has meaning when connections among apparently disparate experiences are forged into a unified whole.</p><p></p><p>Body: Staying Focused</p><p>In the body of your literature analysis, you want to guide your readers through a tour of the poem, story, or play, pausing along the way to comment on, analyze, interpret, and explain key incidents, descriptions, dialogue, symbols, the writer’s use of figurative language—any of the elements of literature that are relevant to a sound analysis of this particular work (See Edward Hirsch’s excellent questions “Talking Back to a Poem” in “How to Read a Poem.”)  Your main goal is to explain how the elements of literature work to elucidate, augment, and develop the theme. The elements of literature are common across genres: a story, a narrative poem, and a play all have a plot and characters. But certain genres privilege certain literary elements. In a poem, for example, form, imagery and metaphor might be especially important; in a story, setting and point-of-view might be more important than they are in a poem; in a play, dialogue, stage directions, lighting serve functions rarely relevant in the analysis of a story or poem.</p><p></p><p>The length of the body of an analysis of a literary work will usually depend upon the length of work being analyzed—the longer the work, the longer the analysis—though your instructor will likely establish a word limit for this assignment. Make certain that you do not simply paraphrase the plot of the story or play or the content of the poem. This is a common weakness in student literary analyses, especially when the analysis is of a poem or a play.</p><p></p><p>Example Body Paragraph(s) </p><p>Here are two good examples of body paragraphs from Amelia’s analysis of “Araby” by James Joyce.</p><p></p><br />
