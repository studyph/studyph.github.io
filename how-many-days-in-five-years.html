The Careless Clown -unknown author- One day, there was once a clown named Lemon. He brings a lot of fun but also, he was very careless. When he did anything, he always ended up and tearing his jacket, making a hole in his socks, and reaping the knees of his trousers. Everybody tells him to be careful, but he finds it very boring. Then, the next day came he had a great idea of buying a sewing machine. He was amazed about the sewing machine because he can sew everything up within a moment. Soon, the most important day in Lemon's life came. Everyone in the town prepared a party for him for the celebration of the service that he made for the citizens to chuckle for so many years. On that day, he would dress like anyone else without wearing his colorful suit. His dream was fulfilled that night because he experienced how to be the hero of the show and not just a clown. The next day, Lemon replaced all his damaged old clothes. And now he learns to take good care of his suits.​</a>

</p><p>360, 000 salary per annum
</p><p>2,000 salary increase per annum
</p><p>The question asks for the salary of the expert on the 12th year.
</p><p>Thus, we can use the formula
</p><p>Salary + (salary increase x number of years)
</p><p>Since salary increase annually is constant, we can multiply it first directly with the number of years.
</p><p>Substituting the given, we will now have
</p><p>360, 000 + (2, 000 x 11)
</p><p>We use 11 years because in the first year, the beginning salary is 360,000. The increase is effective in the second year.
</p><p>384, 000
</p><p>Therefore, the expert's salary on the 12th year will be 382,000.
