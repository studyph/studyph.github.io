Identify the assertions or opinions made in the textWrite your answers on space belowThe Mystery of StonehengeStonehenge is one of England's great mysteries. It is a circle of huge stones on anempty plain. The place is quite remarkable. You can see the stones from miles away. Theyrise high into the skyThese giant stones are very heavy. They weigh up to 50 tons each. No one knowshow the stones were moved to the site. A study shows it would have taken 600 people tomove one stone.Scientists have studied the stones closely. They found that the construction wasdone in three stages. The first stage went from around 2950 to 2900 B.C. Builders dug largeditches in a circle. A huge stone called the heel stone was placed at the entranceThe second stage went from 2900 to 2400 B.C. Builders dug an inner ditch. The thirdstage went from 2550 to 1600 B.C. Builders placed two circles of stones inside the ditchcircles. In the center, they placed another stone. This is called the altar stone.Why was the Stonehenge built? Some people think it was used to study the sun,moon, and stars. The sun shines through some of the stones ion an unusual way at differenttime of the year, especially in spring and fall when the seasons change. Others feel that thesite had religious uses. It may have been used in burial rites.Stonehenge may have been used for both astronomy and religion. Ancient peopleworshipped the sun and moon. They had festivals when the seasons changed. Stonehengecould have been a place to worship the skies and the changing of the seasons.Excerpt from https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/34577123/fact-and-opinion-1​</a>

Identify the assertions or opinions made in the textWrite your answers on space belowThe Mystery of StonehengeStonehenge is one of England's great mysteries. It is a circle of huge stones on anempty plain. The place is quite remarkable. You can see the stones from miles away. Theyrise high into the skyThese giant stones are very heavy. They weigh up to 50 tons each. No one knowshow the stones were moved to the site. A study shows it would have taken 600 people tomove one stone.Scientists have studied the stones closely. They found that the construction wasdone in three stages. The first stage went from around 2950 to 2900 B.C. Builders dug largeditches in a circle. A huge stone called the heel stone was placed at the entranceThe second stage went from 2900 to 2400 B.C. Builders dug an inner ditch. The thirdstage went from 2550 to 1600 B.C. Builders placed two circles of stones inside the ditchcircles. In the center, they placed another stone. This is called the altar stone.Why was the Stonehenge built? Some people think it was used to study the sun,moon, and stars. The sun shines through some of the stones ion an unusual way at differenttime of the year, especially in spring and fall when the seasons change. Others feel that thesite had religious uses. It may have been used in burial rites.Stonehenge may have been used for both astronomy and religion. Ancient peopleworshipped the sun and moon. They had festivals when the seasons changed. Stonehengecould have been a place to worship the skies and the changing of the seasons.Excerpt from https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/34577123/fact-and-opinion-1​</h2><br />
