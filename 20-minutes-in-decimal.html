There are 26 hearts and 26 diamonds out of the 52 cards, so the chances to draw one of those are 50/50.</p><p></p><p>7. The probability expressed as a percent of selecting either a grape or blueberry and then a coconut or pineapple is 50%.</p><p></p><p>8. 53.45%</p><p></p><p>9. The probability of drawing a picture card and then drawing either a heart or diamond is 16/51.</p><p></p><p>10. 50%</p><p></p><p>11. The odds of selecting a marble that is not blue and then selecting a marble that is blue would be 12/30 or 4/10.</p><p></p><p>12. The probability that two players chosen at random will be a pitcher and an infielder is 4/30, or 13.33%.</p><p></p><p>13. No, it is not likely that you will roll a number greater than 4 the first time and a number less than 2 the second time. The chances of rolling a number greater than 4 the first time are 1 in 3, and the chances of rolling a number less than 2 the second time are also 1 in 3. The chances of rolling a number greater than 4 and then a number less than 2 is therefore 1 in 9, which is not likely.</p><p></p><p>14. The probability of drawing a dime and then a penny is 0.06 or 6%.</p><p></p><p>The probability of drawing a dime is 0.20 or 20%, and the probability of drawing a penny is 0.12 or 12%.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the probability of drawing a dime and then a penny is 0.20 x 0.12 = 0.06 or 6%.</p><p></p><p>15. The probability of choosing a letter other than "A" and then choosing an "A" is 37.5%. There are five letters that must be chosen from: A, L, G, E, and B. Of these letters, there is one "A" and four letters other than "A". Therefore, the probability of picking a letter other than "A" first is 4/5. The probability of then picking "A" is 1/5. So, the probability of choosing a letter other than "A" and then choosing an "A" is 4/5 * 1/5 = 4/25 = 16/100 = 0.16 = 16%. As a percent, this would be 16% = 16/100 x 100% = 16% x 100% = 37.5%.</p><p></p><p>16. The probability of drawing either a heart or a diamond than a spade or a club is 2/4 or 1/2 or 50%. This is because there are 2 suits (hearts + diamonds) out of 4 (hearts + diamonds + spades + clubs).</p><p></p><p>17. The probability of selecting either a lime or bubble gum followed by a papaya would be 25/47, or approximately 0.5307.</p><p></p><p>18. The probability of getting an even number on the dice and a head on the coin is 25%.</p><p></p><p>19. There are four picture cards that are diamonds, so the probability of drawing one is 4/52. There are also 36 cards numbered 2-9, so the probability of drawing one after the picture card is 36/52. The total probability of drawing a picture card that is a diamond followed by a card numbered 2-9 is 4/52 × 36/52 = 144/2704, or about 0.053</p><p></p><p>20. The probability of getting three heads in a row is 1/8 or 0.125.</p><p></p><p>21. The probability of selecting a marble that is white or yellow first is 0.455 (14 out of 30 marbles). The probability of then selecting a marble that is cordovan second is 0.067 (2 out of 30 marbles). The combined probability of first selecting a marble that is white or yellow followed by a marble that is cordovan is 0.030 (0.455 x 0.067 = 0.030).</p><p></p><p>22. Three of the seven singles are five, two of the six twenties are twenty. </p><p></p><p> Probability is (3/7)*(2/6) = 10/42 = 0.238 = 23.8%</p><p></p><p>23. It is likely that if he needs to make two consecutive free throws to win the game he will do so, as he shot 58% over the course of five minutes.</p><p></p><p>24. The odds are unfavorable that he will choose a letter that is a vowel followed by a "T" since there is only one letter in the word (the "A") that matches this description.</p><br />
