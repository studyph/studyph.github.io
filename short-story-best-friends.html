Ram is a Grade 6 pupil in one of the schools here in Baguio. He longs to have face-to-face classes because he wanted to learn more from his teachers as they explain/teach the lessons well. Taking a break from answering his modules, he sat on the couch while munching his snack. Then he remembered his best friends Ken and Nick. They often buy the same snack during recess. He enjoyed being with his friends and classmates doing group activities, eating together during recess time and lunch breaks, and playing tag or patintero after classes. He suddenly heard his mom's call reminding him to resume answering his modules for they due the following day. He stopped reminiscing and began answering the next module. 1. Exposition: 2.

 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</a>

We grew up together, shared countless memories, and supported each other through thick and thin. One summer, we decided to take a road trip across the country. It was an adventure of a lifetime, full of laughter, unexpected detours, and unforgettable moments.</p><p></p><p>As we drove through the scenic countryside, we talked about our dreams, fears, and aspirations. We sang along to our favorite songs and stopped at every roadside diner to try the local cuisine. It was a carefree and liberating journey, and we both knew that we would cherish these memories forever.</p><p></p><p>But as we approached our final destination, a sense of melancholy set in. We knew that our trip was coming to an end and that we would soon have to return to our mundane routines. However, we also realized that our friendship was stronger than any distance or time apart.</p><p></p><p>Looking back on that journey, I realize how lucky I am to have a friend like her. She has been my confidant, my partner in crime, and my rock. Our trip taught me that true friendship is not just about having fun or sharing experiences, but also about being there for each other through life's ups and downs.</p><p></p><p>Different kinds of point of view: "My best friend and I have been inseparable since we were kids."

                            29. An allegory is a story that uses characters and settings as symbols that carry a deeper meaning beyond the obvious meaning of the story. Which excerpt from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s "Dr. Heidegger's Experiment" best reveals the allegorical nature of this short story?
 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</p><p>This excerpt reveals the allegorical nature of the story because it shows that the character of the widow is symbolic of the idea of aging and the loss of beauty. She wishes that the coffin-lid were over her face, since it could be no longer beautiful, which is a metaphor for death and the end of life. This passage is showing how the characters in the story are symbols for deeper concepts and ideas.</p><br />
