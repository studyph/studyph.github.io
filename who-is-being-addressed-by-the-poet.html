                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The poem Television wrote by Roald Dahl. The poet was said to see that in a house where the children were supposed to be concentrating on TV, and they are involved in it. They spend so much time in it that they get exhausted. SO in the poem, it is addressed to all children who are busy in watching the TV.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong</p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="who-is-being-addressed-by-the-poet-sonnet-29">
                            2. who is being addressed by the poet sonnet 29?</h2><br />
                        Sonnet 29
<p>
</p><p>This is part of the 154 sonnets written by William Shakespeare. On the sonnet itself, the writer did not clearly provide or give any clues if he is referring to a man or a woman. But some assumes that Sonnet 29 was made for young man.  </p><p>
</p>Its main subject is about depression caused by exclusion from a society or a group and also on his “outcast state”. It also describes personal misfortune and felt like he was cursed by fate. It has been once again referring to being hopeless and a low social status.  <p>
</p><p>Camille Paglia, an American feminist refers the poem as “list of half-imaginary grievances”. Some people agree on her about her concept of the poem mainly because the writer writes his own misery throughout the poem.  </p><p>
</p><p>Every line of the poem has different views and explanations. It is difficult to really identify who is being addressed literally because it defines all possible emotions of whether a man or a woman.  </p><p>
</p><p>Majority of the lines speaks about depression, hopelessness and unhappiness with life and that it can be healed by love and happy thoughts.
</p><p>
</p><p>Every one of us has experience with depression. It can either be us as a person or our love ones and most commonly would be our friends or some random acquaintances. It really is very difficult to overcome the feeling of being not part of a group, unhappy and depressed. Depression is a common and serious mental illness that affects almost everything that we do. The way we feel, the way we think and how we act on a certain situation.  </p><p>
</p><p>Somehow, part of the line in the poem states that happy thoughts and being love could be a solution if you are having a depression or if you feel sad and alone.  </p><p>
</p><p>Being loved by someone can make a person feel happy and confident. Falling in love is sharing similarities that no one has ever been done or shared with you. It makes you become passionate about things and makes you embrace each other’s differences.
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to sum it all up – The writer would want to address the poem to all his readers who is also suffering of the depression, those who cannot see themselves belong to a group or majority of people. Someone who is suffering from the inside that no one else is seeing.  </p><p>
</p><p>You just have to read between the lines to be able to tell what the writer wants to address. If you are finding it difficult to understand or get his main point then that is how a depressed person is feeling.  </p><p>
</p><p>You really have to choose the right set of words to people who is suffering these kinds of illness. You may think that it is okay as you normally use the set of words to everyone however, for depressed individuals, positive words can always have a negative impact to them.  </p><p>

                            19. On Sonnet 29 ?
by GEORGE SANTAYANA 
1. What does the opening line of the poem mean?
2. Who is being addressed by the poet?
3. Why does the poet consider the faiths of old his daily bread?
4. What makes the persona happy?
5. How do you view the persona’s circumstance?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Sonnet 29</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The <strong>poem </strong>“Sonnet 29” by George Santayana pertains to two ideas which are wealth and contentment in one’s life. People who gained countless riches and sees their wealth as a basis of happiness a person will have to attain in his lifetime, and a person who lives through his life not being bound by the idea of riches and believes that what he has is enough and will be enough.
</p>What does the opening line of the <strong>poem </strong>mean?
The opening line of the <strong>poem </strong>focuses on the persona questioning the person being pertained to as to why he must compare his stature to his position. With wealth that person sets a certain level of attaining happiness, yet the question the echoes to his being is “Is he content with his life?”
A human being wouldn’t be able to keep both ends of the stick whether he is poor or he is rich, a visible line between those two is what makes people blinded with true happiness and freedom. Why must a person be only rich or only poor?
Who is being addressed by the poet?
The poet may address it to people who are either wealthy or those who are proud of their being that they refuse to look at their true contentment in life. They can make other people question themselves, because they themselves don’t know of it.
<p>
</p>Why does the poet consider the faiths of old his daily bread?
The daily bread can mean two things, something that is provided everyday it can either be money or any material thing or it can mean as an experience that supplies his daily life. “Faiths of old his daily bread”, he uses the learning of people from the past or even his past as a learning to supply his daily life.
<p>
</p>What makes the persona happy?
The persona is happy because he knows what makes him completely happy; he is content with what he can achieve and what he has. His happiness isn’t bound by someone else’s, and with this feeling of sureness in life he wishes for others to also do so.
<p>
</p>How do you view the persona’s circumstance?
He is happily living every bit of his life, while wishing for others’ too.

                        Who is being addressed by the poet of sonnet 29

Throughout <strong>George Santayana's poem Sonnet 29,</strong> the character in the poem refers  of someone who loves wealth and resources rather than true happiness and spirituality.
<p>
</p>Its key focus is depression induced by alienation from  a <strong>community</strong> or party, as well as his "outcast state."  It also describes personal misfortune and felt  as though he had been cursed by fate.  Yet again it was alluding to  being helpless and a poor social status.  <p>
</p>An <strong>American feminist Camille Paglia </strong>refers to  the poem as a "list of half-imaginary complaints"  Some people agree with her about her concept of poem  mainly because the writer writes throughout the poem his own misery.
<p>
</p>Each line of the <strong>poem</strong>  has different views and different explications.  It's hard to even determine who 's actually being discussed as  it determines all potential feelings about whether a man or a woman.  <p>
</p>Most of the lines talk of <strong>sadness</strong> , hopelessness and <strong>unhappiness</strong>  with life, and that love and positive thoughts will cure it.

Friends​ </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Poetry - </strong> is the literary work in which special intensity is given to the expression of feelings and ideas by the use of distinctive style and rhythm; poems collectively or as a genre of literature.</p><p><strong>The message of poem</strong>  - Meaning is the word referring comprehensively to the ideas expressed within the poem – the poem's sense or message. When understanding poetry, we frequently use the words idea, theme, motif, and meaning. It can be concluded that the message is things to be shown to the reader by the poet through their poems.</p><p><strong>What makes a poem, a poem</strong> - In short, what makes a poem a poem is the ability to make the reader feel something. As has already been mentioned, a poem is different in form from prose--the normal rules of writing just don't apply. That doesn't mean a poem can't have form or punctuation, but it doesn't have to</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is the similarities and difference of poetry and hyper poetry​?</strong></p>Hyper poetry is a form of digital poetry that uses links using hypertext mark-up. Traditional poetry is more strict in its form. The sonnet, ode, blank verse, ballad, dramatic monologue each have formal elements that poets follow. Much poetry on the web is basically just traditional work uploaded. Hyper poetry includes verse with links to sub-poems or footnotes, poetry “generators,” poetry with movement or images. Hyper poetry is usually highly steeped in the visual and sometimes involves parts that are read in varying orders.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><p>Differences of poetry: brainly.ph/question/3095034</p><br />
