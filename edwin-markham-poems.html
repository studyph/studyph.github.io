</p><p>The question now is how hard are we working in order to achieve our goals and live the life that we have ever dreamed of. Challenges would arise and getting the right paying employer would be very hard at first. There are employers who would help you be shaped to become successful in life and there are some that would just use your skills to be able for them to succeed and it may sound selfish but it happens in real life.  </p><p>
</p><p>Having a good and proper education may add points for you to be able to get a well-paying job however, life is hard and not all can be able to afford to go to good schools or even finish school due to financial issue or problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are employers who would also hire people even though they do not have a degree to show. Some may become successful in it but most of the time people are being used and not treated fairly.  </p><p>
</p><p>It always depends on us if we would tolerate being treated unfairly by some employers. According to the poem, the man has been deprived of basic freedom and treated like a slave. Slave who would serve and please their masters all their lives. It is as if they have given their whole life to their masters.  </p><p>
</p><p>Not treated fairly at work or being treated as a slave is not a healthy work environment. It will fully consume you until you get exhausted and give up.  </p><p>
</p><p>Do not let yourself be treated unfairly. Work at your best and make sure you do not let yourself be used by someone in power.

                            11. Who are the modern “man with the hoe”? (Poem The Man With the Hoe by Edwin Markham)</h2><br />
                        The "man with the hoe" represents slaves and servants who have been robbed of their humanity. The poem alludes how we can make right the bent back of a man who has been abused and stolen of his freedom and facility. Markham asks how we can right a man who we had systematically put down and made to feel like the dirt of the ground. <br /><br />He also uses the men that has been blessed by God to highlight how we should have lived, rather than how we treat these people. <br />

                        <p>Markham mentions that the man's mental state was also influenced by his work's immense pressure. He can't appreciate the beauty around him anymore— such as the the sunrise, the beauty of the flowers, the light of stars, or even music. Markham states that his soul has been consumed; that is, the light of it has been lost. He has to look up again, see the sun, enjoy music, and experience his destiny.</p><p></p><p>The poet describes the man with the hoe spiritually as slipping from the image God created at the beginning and intended to represent humanity. Instead, "the world's blind greed" has made this poor man a "subject of the chain of labor" far from God's original dream for him. Markham claims that "masters, lords and leaders in all countries" are responsible for this man's troubles and sorrows, now as well as in the future.</p><p></p><p>This image is an actuality in modern days. Many are slaving away, working, and not enjoying the life that was given, in order to provide for their families. The same as the saying that many people nowadays are just "existing" and not "living." Many companies doesn't consider their workers' well-being, and only provide the bare minimum of which the government requires in order to pass along the requirements.</p><p></p><p>------------------</p><p>Who are the subjects of The Man with the Hoe?</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/234951</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/223879</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Edwin Markham, who has been called “the dean of American poets,” received national fame, and later worldwide fame, when he published “The Man with the Hoe.” It changed his career immediately. The poem consists of forty-nine lines divided into five stanzas of social commentary that focus on America’s working class and their sufferings. It is a striking poem of protest against exploited labor.</p><p>After viewing French artist Jean-François Millet’s world-famous painting of a peasant leaning on his hoe, The Man with the Hoe (1862), Markham was inspired to write his poem in 1898. He is reported to have seen the original painting, which had a profound effect on him, in San Francisco. Markham was at a New Year’s Eve celebration when he read the poem to an editor of the San Francisco Examiner. Shortly thereafter, the poem was published in that paper.</p><p>Because of its popularity, the poem was translated into many languages and reprinted in magazines, newspapers, and books numerous times. The poem’s success allowed Markham to spend more time writing and lecturing. In regard to the reform movements concerning labor struggles of the time, the poem generated much controversy. The newspapers received many letters regarding “The Man with the Hoe.” The poem was open to different interpretations. Some readers said that the poem was advocating socialism: Some were in support of the concept; others were against it. Others said the poem contained a prophetic message that could incite unessential reforms. Still others considered the poem a medium for expressing farmers’ and workers’ grievances.</p><p>For Markham, Millet’s peasant symbolized the exploited classes worldwide. Markham said that he viewed it as “a poem of hope. a cry for justice.” In the fourth stanza, Markham addresses the “masters, lords, and rulers in all lands.” He interrogates them with an implied sense of optimism:</p><p>Is this the handiwork you give to God,This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?How will you ever straighten up this shape,Touch it again with immortality;Give back the upward looking and the light;Rebuild in it the music and the dream;Make right the immemorial infamies,Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?</p><br />

                        The author is alluding to the man with the hoe not being able to contemplate the philosophical, abstract problems that Plato faced. <br /><br />The stanza is pertaining to the ancient Greek period wherein the philosophy and politics were seen to be the area of the enlightened and great men, much like Plato. The swing of Pleadiades would refer to the constellations, a reference to astronomy, another work of enlightened men during that time. <br /><br />The poem is asserting that the man with the hoe cannot contemplate on these problems of man as he cannot even see beyond the ground that he attends to.<br />
