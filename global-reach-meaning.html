                                            Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. "The climbing dcath toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio- economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</a>

The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</a>

As a result, globalization brings to the light the fact that since religions have similar values, not one of them is “correct” and, therefore, can be changed.</p><p>2.) It is as empirical evidence that Islam since the time of the Prophet Muhammad has been doing globalization in the trade.

By expanding the definition of globalization to accommodate ideational factors and cultural exchange, religion’s agency in the process can be enabled.

                            4. Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. "The climbing dcath toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio- economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</h2><br />

                            8. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</h2><br />
