They declare their love with a kiss and vow to meet the next day. Romeo turns to his old friend Friar Laurence and tells him of his intention to marry the daughter of his family's enemy. The friar agrees to marry the young couple as quickly as an opportunity provides itself. Meanwhile, Juliet sends her nurse to make the necessary arrangements, and that afternoon Romeo and Juliet are secretly married in Friar Laurence's cell. Romeo soon finds himself in the middle of a fight between Mercutio his cousin) and Tybalt (Juliet's cousin).

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.) Bulb plants like onions tend to store food in the form of sugar, rather than starch.</p><p>2.) Iodine is the best material that's widely used to recognize any traces of starch.

Unfortunately, the ball is hosted by their swom enemy Lord Capulet. In order not to provoke trouble, the young intruders go in disguise. However, all thoughts of Rosaline flee as Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet, daughter of Capulet, and she with him. In only a moment's time, however, they discover each other's identity. Their love is forbidden. As Romeo and his friends make their way home, they pass by the home of the Capulets, and Romeo unable to restrain himself, climbs the garden wall just as Juliet appears on her Balcony. They declare their love with a kiss and vow to meet the next day. Romeo turns to his old friend Friar Laurence and tells him of his intention to marry the daughter of his family's enemy. The friar agrees to marry the young couple as quickly as an opportunity provides itself. Meanwhile, Juliet sends her nurse to make the necessary arrangements, and that afternoon Romeo and Juliet are secretly married in Friar Laurence's cell. Romeo soon finds himself in the middle of a fight between Mercutio his cousin) and Tybalt (Juliet's cousin). He tries to be a peacemaker and put a stop to the fighting, but his interference succeeds only in getting Mercutio mortally wounded. Romeo, furious at the death of his friend and kinsman, challenges Tybalt and kills him. The situation is now desperate, and Romeo turns again to his friend, the friar, who informs him that the prince, having learned of his fight with Tybalt , has banished him to Mantua. Next morning, Romeo leaves for Mantua and a horrified Juliet, learning of the marriage plans, flees to Friar Laurence, who offers a drug that will give her the appearance of death for two days. He assures her that he will get words to Romeo who will rescue her from the Capulet burial vault and take her to Mantua. She agrees to the plan and takes the potion before going to bed.
