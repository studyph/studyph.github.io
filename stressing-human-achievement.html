1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                                            PA HELP POActivity 3. Empower yourself (Reading activity) The Greeks formulated the word politics during the 4th and 5th century. Politics was inseparable in the life in the polis or a place of state shared by a certain group of people. This concept of politics is as old as the first organization created by man. According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</a>

                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                                            2. How can we achieve cohesion, fluency, tone, and correctness in writing spoken texts? Answers: This study explores the potential for automated indices related to speech delivery, language use, and topic development to model human judgements of TOEFL speaking proficiency in second language (22) speech samples. For this study, 244 transcribed TOEFL speed samples taken from 244 22 learners were analyzed using automated indices taken from Coh-Metrix, CPIDR, and Liwc. A stepwise linear regression was used to explain the variance in human judgements of independent speaking ability and overall speaking proficiency. Automated indices related to word type counts, causal cohesion, and lexical diversity predicted 52% of the variance in human ratings for independent speech samples. Automated indices related to word type counts and word frequency predicted 61% of the variance Col of the human scores of overall speaking proficiency. These analyses demonstrate that, even in the absence of indices related to pronoun- ciation and prosody (e.g.phonological accurancy, intonation, and stress) automated indices related to vocabulary size, causality, and word Frequency can predict a the variance in humain ratings of speaking proficiency, these findings have . significant amount of​</a>

                            7. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</h2><br />

                            12. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

                            16. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                            20. 2. How can we achieve cohesion, fluency, tone, and correctness in writing spoken texts? Answers: This study explores the potential for automated indices related to speech delivery, language use, and topic development to model human judgements of TOEFL speaking proficiency in second language (22) speech samples. For this study, 244 transcribed TOEFL speed samples taken from 244 22 learners were analyzed using automated indices taken from Coh-Metrix, CPIDR, and Liwc. A stepwise linear regression was used to explain the variance in human judgements of independent speaking ability and overall speaking proficiency. Automated indices related to word type counts, causal cohesion, and lexical diversity predicted 52% of the variance in human ratings for independent speech samples. Automated indices related to word type counts and word frequency predicted 61% of the variance Col of the human scores of overall speaking proficiency. These analyses demonstrate that, even in the absence of indices related to pronoun- ciation and prosody (e.g.phonological accurancy, intonation, and stress) automated indices related to vocabulary size, causality, and word Frequency can predict a the variance in humain ratings of speaking proficiency, these findings have . significant amount of​</h2><br />
