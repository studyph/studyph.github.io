The body is not an object to be studied in relation to culture, but is to beconsidered as the subject of culture, or in other words as the existential ground ofculture. On the other hand, Geertz (1973) described culture as "a system of inheritedconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate,perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life".The interpretation of the symbols in each culture is essential which gives meaning toone's action. Each culture has its own symbols and has its own meaning; one mustneed to comprehend those meanings keeping in mind the end goal to understand theculture. One must disconnect the components of culture, discover the relationshipamong those components, and portray theentire framework in some broad way.​can you explain it for me pls?? need ko lang po</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fact that people care about an issue is of course important in a democracy – no politician will last long if they ignore public opinion. However, this can mean important matters which don’t get much public attention may be neglected, leading to big problems later.</p><p></p><p>One cause of this selective public attention is availability bias: the tendency to think an issue is important because it comes to mind easily. An example is a person thinking that plane journeys, but not car trips, are dangerous because they have seen airplane crashes in the news. In contrast, car crashes are routine enough that they do not attract much media coverage, and so examples of them do not come to mind as quickly.</p><p></p><p>One example of the impact of availability bias is the number of additional Americans who died in road accidents by switching from flying to driving after 11 September 2001, which exceeded the number who died in the attacks after just three months.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> IT</strong><strong> HELPS</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />

                            14. what is the meaning of cultural and political limits in the case of japan regarding the development of its culture during henian period</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the Heian period in Japan (794-1185), there were both cultural and political limits that shaped the development of Japanese culture. Culturally, the Heian period was characterized by a strong influence from Chinese culture, as well as the emergence of a distinct Japanese aesthetic in literature, art, and architecture. Politically, the period was marked by the dominance of the imperial court and the nobility, which limited social mobility and the development of a more diverse and dynamic society. These cultural and political limits helped to shape the unique character of Japanese culture during the Heian period, but also restricted its potential for growth and change.</p><p></p><br />

The body is not an object to be studied in relation to culture, but is to beconsidered as the subject of culture, or in other words as the existential ground ofculture. On the other hand, Geertz (1973) described culture as "a system of inheritedconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate,perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life".The interpretation of the symbols in each culture is essential which gives meaning toone's action. Each culture has its own symbols and has its own meaning; one mustneed to comprehend those meanings keeping in mind the end goal to understand theculture. One must disconnect the components of culture, discover the relationshipamong those components, and portray theentire framework in some broad way.​can you explain it for me pls?? need ko lang po</h2><br />
                        <p>Culture is a complex concept that encompasses many different aspects of human experience. It is shared among members of a particular group or society, and is expressed through various symbolic forms such as language, art, and rituals. Culture is also learned through socialization and is passed down from one generation to the next.</p><p></p><p>The concept of embodiment is also important in understanding culture. This refers to the idea that the human body is not simply an object to be studied, but is the subject of culture and the existential ground of culture. In other words, the body is not just a vessel for culture, but is an active participant in the cultural process.</p><p></p><p>As with any complex concept, there are different ways to approach the study of culture. For example, some anthropologists, like Clifford Geertz, focus on the symbolic forms of culture and the ways in which these symbols give meaning to our actions. Others, like Thomas Csordas, focus on the embodied nature of culture and the ways in which the body is an active participant in the cultural process. Overall, the study of culture is a rich and fascinating field that offers many different perspectives and approaches.</p><br />
