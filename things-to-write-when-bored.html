                                            Passage #1 - Chemical and Physical Changes All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of the clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is bent, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical change are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Passage #2 - The Best PB and J Ever When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking a lid off the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching "Cops on the TV. I swear, it was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I have ever eaten.

                                            7.Moderator: why are the polocies of bullying not working? a) Panel: Physical bullying is when bullies hurt their targets physically. This mightbe shoving, tripping, punching, or hitting.b) Panel: I think the problem that it's not working as no one wants to enforce therules. No one wants to take the time, the effort. And, when they do the time,effort and punishment isn't fitting the crime. It's picking-up trash or staying afterschool.c) Panel: Some bullies don't understand normal social emotions like guilt,empathy, compassion, or remorse. These people need help from a mentalhealth professional like a counselor, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.d) Panel: If you've been bullied with rumors or gossip, tell your friends so that theycan help you feel safe and secure. Avoid being alone, especially when thebullying is happening a lot.8. Moderator: Why do we feel the need to judge other people?a) Panel: I deeply believe that people bully people because they're bored. Theyhave nothing better to do because if you have something better to do like youhad to go somewhere, you wouldn't take the time to sit there and make fun ofsomebody.b) Panel: Join your school's bullying or violence prevention programs. Peermediation is another way you may be able to work things out with a bully. Ifyour school doesn't have these programs, start one of your own.c) Panel: Try talking to a trusted adult to talk about why you have become a bully.Ask them for some advice on how you could change.d) Panel: You're more likely to be hurt and get into trouble if you try to fight a bully.Work out your anger in another way, such as exercising or writing it down.​</a>

physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of malter
All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be day.
Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the
matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter
Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the
with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and
will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes
are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent,
which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the
state of matter.

When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the
peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the
peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put
the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching
"Probinsyano on TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich
I ever ate.

For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay.Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change thematter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matterwith different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash andwill never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changesare temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent,which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect thestate of matter.2.Gov. Chavit Singson doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majesticbeasts are disappearing at an alarming rate. Gov.

                            9. Passage #1 - Chemical and Physical Changes All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter.

Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is bent, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical change are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Passage #2 - The Best PB and J Ever When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread.

It's picking-up trash or staying afterschool.c) Panel: Some bullies don't understand normal social emotions like guilt,empathy, compassion, or remorse. These people need help from a mentalhealth professional like a counselor, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.d) Panel: If you've been bullied with rumors or gossip, tell your friends so that theycan help you feel safe and secure. Avoid being alone, especially when thebullying is happening a lot.8. Moderator: Why do we feel the need to judge other people?a) Panel: I deeply believe that people bully people because they're bored. Theyhave nothing better to do because if you have something better to do like youhad to go somewhere, you wouldn't take the time to sit there and make fun ofsomebody.b) Panel: Join your school's bullying or violence prevention programs. Peermediation is another way you may be able to work things out with a bully. Ifyour school doesn't have these programs, start one of your own.c) Panel: Try talking to a trusted adult to talk about why you have become a bully.Ask them for some advice on how you could change.d) Panel: You're more likely to be hurt and get into trouble if you try to fight a bully.Work out your anger in another way, such as exercising or writing it down.​</h2><br />

physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of malter
All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and
matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be day.
Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the
matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter
Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the
with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and
will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes
are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent,
which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the
state of matter.

Gov. Chavit Singson doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic
beasts are disappearing at an alarming rate. Gov. Chavit thinks that we should
write to our congress people. If we let them know that we demand the
preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Gov. Chavit also
thinks that we should donate to Save the Tigers. Our donations will help to
support and empower those who are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers.
We owe it to our grandchildren to do something.
