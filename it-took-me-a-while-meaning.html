There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest its delicious fruit. However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. "Get out of here!" the stranger shouted. "This tree belongs to me now!" "No, it doesn't!" The children cried. "You don't own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!" The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an idea. She threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing. Stop!" He shouted. "You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!" Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. "What have you done to this poor girl?" The headman asked him. "Nothing!" The stranger replied. "She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground." The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. "I'm afraid she has mango sickness," the headman said shaking his head. "You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree... You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year." The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village. The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs. Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.

                                            1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</a>

Browse the selection to fill in the problem-solution outline activity below.There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest its delicious fruit. However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. “Get out of here!” the stranger shouted. “This tree belongs to me now!” “No, it doesn't!” The children cried. “You don’t own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!” The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an idea. She threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing. Stop!” He shouted. “You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!” Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. “What have you done to this poor girl?” The headman asked him. “Nothing!” The stranger replied. “She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground. "The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. “I’m afraid she has mango sickness,” the headman said shaking his head. “You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree. You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year.” The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village. the next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs. Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.PROBLEM:WHO: *WHAT: *WHY: *SOLUTION:ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS: *RESULTS: *END RESULT: *Need ko po talaga to plsss paki ayos Ng sagot po plsssss​</a>

                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

                                            what are characters in the story?Anonymous1When Aiden asked me to accompany him on a camping trip to the mountains. I envisioned a log cabinwith a crackling fireplace, hot cocoa, and bunk beds. Imagine how my rustic, yet comfortable image of campingI became a nightmare when Aiden and his older brother. Lebron, showed up with a truck filled with camping1supplies-tents, rolled-up sleeping bags, and canteens! I did pack a backpack, as instructed, but I had no ideawe were going on survival training!11Lebron, ever so efficient, had a schedule to keep, and he hurried me to get in so we could leave the cityhustle and bustle behind us. Ahead, the mountains loomed bigger than I had remembered them, the trees were1larger, and the environment was much more dangerous. At least the weather was amazing-cotton-candy clouds1 dotted the deep blue sky.111At the trailhead, Lebron strapped a sleeping bag onto my pack and lectured Aiden and me about hikingetiquette.111The first part of the trail looked more like a wooded road that led up the mountains than a hiking path.Soon, the path became narrower and steeper, forcing me to focus on the task at hand and to tak less. As wegained elevation, we moved above the tree line, and I could see the trail zigzagging up the mountain."It looks closer than it is," Lebron said, reading my facial cues. This is the most difficult part... watch thetrail, not the view. Loose rocks and tree roots make the trail dangerous, and we have no shade."1Finally, we reached the summit. My legs aching, I dropped my pack and groaned.111"No time to rest," Lebron said, looking up at the sky. The weather had been warmed all day, and it feltgood to relax in the cool breeze,1"The weather up here changes quickly, and that cool air means a storm is brewing. We need to set up !camp.I thought he was kidding, but Lebron was quite serious. He and Aiden worked expertly, while I stood Iaround and pretended to help, thunder rumbling in the distance. We set up near a boulder outcropping, but thewind, thunder, and lightning were relentless. As the storm rolled in with a vengeance, we took cover inside.11Lebron, sensing that I was scared, reached in his backpack for some crackers and peanut butter. Slowly,but methodically, he spread the peanut butter and told stories about his camping adventures. Each time lightning1lit up the tent and the thunder echoed, I cringed.1"This is just a typical summer storm-they're short lived, but intense, Lebron stated. The campsite mightget a bit muddy, but what's the fun in camping if you can't get dirty! At least the rain will keep the bears away," heI said with a smile.And just as quickly as the storm came rushing in, it subsided, allowing us to exit the tent The view wasstunning could see for miles, and the rain left a fresh scent of pine and an earthy smell of soil. As darkness setin, I marveled at the multitude of stars in the night sky.I won't lie was yearning for a hot shower and a soft bed, but as I gazed upward at the Milky Way,knew this was an adventure I would never forget.​</a>

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</a>

He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</a>

11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms. *

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard. *

I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

A 1 means that the story is clich while a 10 means that it has at least a couple of ideas that I haven't encountered before 2. Setting. On a scale of 1 to 10. how well was the setting developed? A 1 indicates that the settin was poorly developed. This means that is almost completely disappeared from the story. or that felt confused as to where and when the tale took place in one or more scenes. Of course, the authe should involve all of the senses in descrbing his or her setting. A 10 means that not only is th setting well-developed, but informs every aspect of the story from character development to tor and narrative style. In a story that rates a 10, the setting itself is a powerful draw for the story, ar the author succeeded in transporting me into the tale 3. Characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10 how well-drawn are the characters in the story? Go characters should convince us that they grew up in the world or setting that we ve placed them They should have complex motives and be imbued with conflicting attitudes about life, ethic politics, and so on. The characters should have friends, enemies, acquaintances, secrets desir and fears. The character should have a physical body, with a physical history. The character shou have a family, of course, and some type of history, along with a place in society. In short, with poorty drawn character, we know virtually nothing about him by the end of the story. With a w drawn character, we feel as if we know him intimately by the end of the story​</a>

He picked it up and flew to the top of a tree. While he wassitting there eating his meat, a kasaykasay (a small bird) passed by. She was carrying a dead rat, and was flyingvery fast. The crow called to her and said, "Kasaykasay, where did you get that dead rat that you have?" But thesmall bird did not answer she flew on her way. When the crow saw that she paid no attention to him, he was veryangry and he called out. "Kasaykasay. Kasaykasay, stop and give me a piece of that rat, or I will follow you andtake the whole thing for myself!" Still the small bird paid no attention to him. At last full of greed and rage, the crowdetermined to have the rat by any means. He left the meat he was eating, and flew after the small creature Althoughshe was only a little bird, the Kasaykasay could fly faster than the crow--so he could not catch her While the crowwas chasing the Kasaykasay, a hawk happened to pass by the tree where the crow had left his meat. The hawksaw the meat, and at once seized it in his claws and flew away.Although the crow pursued the Kasaykasay a long time, he could not overtake her so at last he gave up hisattempt and flew back to the tree where he had left his meat But when he came to the spot, and found that themeat was gone, he was almost ready to die of disappointment and hunger By and by the hawk which had takenthe meat passed the tree again. He called to the crow and said to him, "Mr Crow do you know that I am the onewho took your meat? If not, I will tell you now, and I am very sorry for you.The crow did not answer the hawk, for he was so tired and weak that he could hardly breatheAnswer the questions comprehensively1.

However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. "Get out of here!" the stranger shouted. "This tree belongs to me now!" "No, it doesn't!" The children cried. "You don't own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!" The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them.

At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. "What have you done to this poor girl?" The headman asked him. "Nothing!" The stranger replied. "She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground." The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. "I'm afraid she has mango sickness," the headman said shaking his head. "You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree... You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year." The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village. The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs.

                            6. 1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The speaker describes his countrymen as worth dying for. An untapped resource. The Filipino men are described as free from constraints but are willing to surrender if it benefits his/her land. But, if they find injustice and abuse from the system, they would not be afraid to seek justice and peace.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2. The speaker regards himself as a Filipino who's forgiving, patient, and has good will. But most importantly, he regards himself as a Filipino who has a deep love for his country.</p><p></p><p>3. If I were to suffer and live the way the speaker has. I would show hostility rather than seek peace and forgiveness. It may make me sound bitter, but I still haven't reached the point in life where I can afford to give forgiveness to whoever has wronged me. But in the end, I applaud the speaker's action. He seeks justice not through violence, but with peace.</p><br />

                            9. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />

                            12. what are characters in the story?Anonymous1When Aiden asked me to accompany him on a camping trip to the mountains. I envisioned a log cabinwith a crackling fireplace, hot cocoa, and bunk beds. Imagine how my rustic, yet comfortable image of campingI became a nightmare when Aiden and his older brother. Lebron, showed up with a truck filled with camping1supplies-tents, rolled-up sleeping bags, and canteens! I did pack a backpack, as instructed, but I had no ideawe were going on survival training!11Lebron, ever so efficient, had a schedule to keep, and he hurried me to get in so we could leave the cityhustle and bustle behind us. Ahead, the mountains loomed bigger than I had remembered them, the trees were1larger, and the environment was much more dangerous. At least the weather was amazing-cotton-candy clouds1 dotted the deep blue sky.111At the trailhead, Lebron strapped a sleeping bag onto my pack and lectured Aiden and me about hikingetiquette.111The first part of the trail looked more like a wooded road that led up the mountains than a hiking path.Soon, the path became narrower and steeper, forcing me to focus on the task at hand and to tak less. As wegained elevation, we moved above the tree line, and I could see the trail zigzagging up the mountain."It looks closer than it is," Lebron said, reading my facial cues. This is the most difficult part... watch thetrail, not the view. Loose rocks and tree roots make the trail dangerous, and we have no shade."1Finally, we reached the summit. My legs aching, I dropped my pack and groaned.111"No time to rest," Lebron said, looking up at the sky. The weather had been warmed all day, and it feltgood to relax in the cool breeze,1"The weather up here changes quickly, and that cool air means a storm is brewing. We need to set up !camp.I thought he was kidding, but Lebron was quite serious. He and Aiden worked expertly, while I stood Iaround and pretended to help, thunder rumbling in the distance. We set up near a boulder outcropping, but thewind, thunder, and lightning were relentless. As the storm rolled in with a vengeance, we took cover inside.11Lebron, sensing that I was scared, reached in his backpack for some crackers and peanut butter. Slowly,but methodically, he spread the peanut butter and told stories about his camping adventures. Each time lightning1lit up the tent and the thunder echoed, I cringed.1"This is just a typical summer storm-they're short lived, but intense, Lebron stated. The campsite mightget a bit muddy, but what's the fun in camping if you can't get dirty! At least the rain will keep the bears away," heI said with a smile.And just as quickly as the storm came rushing in, it subsided, allowing us to exit the tent The view wasstunning could see for miles, and the rain left a fresh scent of pine and an earthy smell of soil. As darkness setin, I marveled at the multitude of stars in the night sky.I won't lie was yearning for a hot shower and a soft bed, but as I gazed upward at the Milky Way,knew this was an adventure I would never forget.​</h2><br />

he would still have experienced the same comforts had he
not encountered the magic tree? Explain your answer.
The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</h2><br />

                            15. read the story. copy lines from the story that shows hyperbole and lines that shows litotes.THE WONDERFUL PEAR-TREEOnce upon a time a countryman came into the town on market-day, and brought a load of very special pears with him to sell. He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</h2><br />

A 1 indicates that the settin was poorly developed. This means that is almost completely disappeared from the story. or that felt confused as to where and when the tale took place in one or more scenes. Of course, the authe should involve all of the senses in descrbing his or her setting. A 10 means that not only is th setting well-developed, but informs every aspect of the story from character development to tor and narrative style. In a story that rates a 10, the setting itself is a powerful draw for the story, ar the author succeeded in transporting me into the tale 3. Characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10 how well-drawn are the characters in the story? Go characters should convince us that they grew up in the world or setting that we ve placed them They should have complex motives and be imbued with conflicting attitudes about life, ethic politics, and so on. The characters should have friends, enemies, acquaintances, secrets desir and fears. The character should have a physical body, with a physical history. The character shou have a family, of course, and some type of history, along with a place in society. In short, with poorty drawn character, we know virtually nothing about him by the end of the story. With a w drawn character, we feel as if we know him intimately by the end of the story​</h2><br />

When the crow saw that she paid no attention to him, he was veryangry and he called out. "Kasaykasay. Kasaykasay, stop and give me a piece of that rat, or I will follow you andtake the whole thing for myself!" Still the small bird paid no attention to him. At last full of greed and rage, the crowdetermined to have the rat by any means. He left the meat he was eating, and flew after the small creature Althoughshe was only a little bird, the Kasaykasay could fly faster than the crow--so he could not catch her While the crowwas chasing the Kasaykasay, a hawk happened to pass by the tree where the crow had left his meat. The hawksaw the meat, and at once seized it in his claws and flew away.Although the crow pursued the Kasaykasay a long time, he could not overtake her so at last he gave up hisattempt and flew back to the tree where he had left his meat But when he came to the spot, and found that themeat was gone, he was almost ready to die of disappointment and hunger By and by the hawk which had takenthe meat passed the tree again. He called to the crow and said to him, "Mr Crow do you know that I am the onewho took your meat?
