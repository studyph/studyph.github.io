                                            You are a group of senior managers working for a fast- growing computer software company. Your product allows users to play interactive role- playing games over the Internet. In the past 3 years, your company has gone from being a start- up enterprise with 10 employees and no revenues to a company with 250 employees and revenues of $60 million. It has been growing so rapidly that you have not had time to create a strategic plan, but now your board of directors is telling you that they want to see a plan, and they want it to drive decision making and resource allocation at the company. They want you to design a planning process that will have the following attributes: 1. It will be democratic, involving as many key employees as possible in the process. 2. It will help to build a sense of shared vision within the company about how to continue to grow rapidly. 3. It will lead to the generation of three to fivekey strategies for the company. 4. It will drive the formulation of detailed action plans, and these plans will be subsequently linked to the company’s annual operating budget. Required: Design a planning process to present to your board of directors. Think carefully about who should be included in this process. Be sure to outline the strengths and weaknesses of the approach you choose and be prepared to justify why your approach might be superior to alternative approaches. (​</a>
