                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. BALANCE : </p><p>Balance in Art refers to the use of artistic elements such as line, texture, color, and form in the creation of artworks in a way that renders visual stability. Balance is one of the principles of organization of structural elements of art and design, along with unity, proportion, emphasis and rhythm. </p><p></p><p>2. EMPHASIS :</p><p>Emphasis is the principle of art that helps the audience put the story of a painting together in their own minds. Any object or area of emphasis is called a focal point. The focal point is meant to be the part of an artwork to which the viewer's eyes are first attracted. Artworks can have multiple focal points.</p><p></p><p>3. HARMONY :</p><p>Harmony is the principle of art that creates cohesiveness by stressing the similarities of separate but related parts. ... Specifically, harmony uses the elements of art (color, line, shape, form, value, space, texture) as a vehicle to create a sense of togetherness amongst otherwise separate parts.</p><p></p><p>4. VARIETY :</p><p>Variety is the principle of art that adds interest to an artwork. Variety works through juxtaposition and contrast. When an artist places different visual elements next to one another, he/she is using variety. Straight lines next to curvy lines add variety.</p><p></p><p>5. MOVEMENT :</p><p>Movement is the principle of art that an artist uses to guide a viewer's eye in, through, and out of a composition.</p><p></p><p>6. RHYTHM :</p><p>Rhythm is a principle of design that suggests movement or action. Rhythm is usually achieved through repetition of lines, shapes, colors, and more. It creates a visual tempo in artworks and provides a path for the viewer's eye to follow.</p><p></p><p>7. PROPORTION :</p><p>Proportion is the principle of art that refers to relative size. The principles of art differ from the elements of art. ... By manipulating proportion, the artist can make his/her subject seem strong, weak, funny, mysterious, etc. We can exaggerate proportions to emphasize a meaning or an element within the scene.</p><p></p><p>hope this helps ! :D</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.<strong>Balance</strong>- the design could be identified on both sides that can be achieve on Symmetrical balance or Asymmetrical balance.</p><p>2.<strong>Emphasis</strong>- it is the center of interest. </p><p>3. <strong>Harmony</strong>- A relationship of different portion of a design.</p><p>4. <strong>Variety</strong>- refers to how artists and designers add complexity to their work using visual elements.</p><p>5. <strong>Movement</strong>- is the principle of art that an artist uses to guide a viewer's eye in, through, and out of a composition.</p><p>6. <strong>Rhythm</strong>- a relationship between elements that creates a sense of harmony.</p><p>7. <strong>Proportion</strong>- the pleasing relationship of all parts of the objects with one another. </p><p></p><br />

Repetition- This is the pattern itself.</p><p>- A combination of shapes, colors, or other elements recurring across the composition.</p><p>- Objects might be repeated such that they slowly get smaller, or slowly change color – where the pattern starts and stops is important! Patterns usually evoke feelings of security and calm.</p><p>7. Rhythm- often the use of regular, evenly distributed elements</p><p>8. Variety- a sense of the difference between elements of an artwork – the opposite of unity, or harmony.</p><p>- it adds a sense of chaos to a work, and this is often used to highlight certain powerful emotions. Salvador Dali is one of the artists who have experimented with chaos and variety in his paintings, yet achieved a great sense of perfection.</p><p>9. Harmony- the use of related elements.</p><p>10. Radial balance- he elements are arranged around a central point and may be similar</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Automotive technology is the practical application of knowledge about self-propelled vehicles or machines. Students studying automotive technology learn about engine construction, fuel and ignition systems, power trains, brakes, transmissions, electronic and diagnostic equipment, and more.2. A learning continuity plan seeks to ensure that students learning progresses even amidstdisasters such as natural calamities, storms, fires, and pandemics. This plan overcomes obstacles created bythe disasters through innovative means of teaching and learning, keeping students on track with theircourses.3. Vlog posts consist of creating a video of yourself where you talk on a particular subject such as reporting or reviewing a product or an event. It can even serve as a way to share your artistic process or provide a tutorial guide on a creative practice or topic. Some vloggers even use it as a means to share new performance art or music they have created.4. Nathaniel Hawthorne opens his novel, The Scarlet Letter, with a paragraph that depicts a crowd assembled in front of a prison door. The people are waiting for Hester Prynne to show up with her scarlet letter "A." The author describes the crowd as a "throng," suggesting a mob-like and densely packed group. The mood is not pleasant, but somber-displayed by their "sad-colored" garments, hoods, and gray hats.5. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing a range of illnesses, from the common cold to more serious infections such as those caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

Definition </strong>- is the method of identifying a given term and making its meaning clearer. It can be presented in three ways </p><p>i. Formal – explains a term to be defined, category and details </p><p>Example: Vitamin E is a light yellow fat- soluble vitamins that acts an anti- oxidant. </p><p>ii. Informal – is done through a parenthetical or brief explanation </p><p>Example : Tocopherol ( Vitamin E ) is naturally found in vegetable oil, fish and nuts </p><p>iii. Extended – a detailed way of defining and term and usually composed of at least one paragraph ( formal and informal, comparison and contrast, narration, description , etc.) </p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Explication</strong>- is a method of explanation in which sentences, verses, quotes or passages are taken from a literary or academic work and then interpreted and explained in a detailed way </p><p>Example: The poem titled “ The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost is about a man reflecting on a choice he had once made. While the outcome of his choice is not implied to be positive or negative the speaker notes that the choice in itself and the consequences of that choice have made a huge difference in a way his life is unfolded.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. Clarification </strong>- is a method of explanation in which the points are organized from a general abstract idea to specific and concrete examples </p><p>Example: </p><p>Justice is a broad concept which encompasses a wide set of ideas , most of which also branch out into similar notions. For instance, it can refer to the sentencing of criminal based on due process. When an individual gets what he deserves outside the hands of the law, it is also considered justice in some contexts.</p><p></p><p>You can visit the following page to know the meaning of Speech:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11481300</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
