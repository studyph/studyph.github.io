                                            Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem. Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).
Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.
Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.
Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.
Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.
Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.
Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.
Abiotic Components
Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem. It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc. 
Functions of Ecosystem
The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:
It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.
It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.
It maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem.
It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.
The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy.
So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:
Productivity – It refers to the rate of biomass production.
Energy flow – It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.
Decomposition – It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.
Nutrient cycling – In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilisation by various organisms.</a>

                                            We live here on earth where living and nonliving worlds interact through the four major subsystems: the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. The (1.)_________ includes all living things from the simplest unicellular organisms to the most complex such as human beings. The (2.)_________ is composed of the gases on earth. It also helps us against the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun as it has an ozone layer that shields us from the harm it may cause. The (3.)_________ is composed of all the water bodies on earth. Water in its solid state, gaseous state or liquid state are all part of this sphere. It is essential because it is a major component of our body that drives chemical reactions that sustain all our metabolic activities. (4.)_________ is another sphere which provides soil with a lot of minerals that supply the plants’ needs for growth and development. It even holds the reservoir of fresh ground water, our source of safe drinking water. The four spheres are interlocking wonders as they keep the earth a livable planet. Human beings cannot live without the air, water, and the plants and animals which serve as food. These plants and animals also depend on the provision of necessary resources that keep them nourished to sustain their own metabolic functions. Plants (5.)_________. They depend on the resources they get from the spheres specifically (6._________) from the atmosphere, (7._________) from the hydrosphere and (8._________) from the geosphere. Animals (9.) _________ their food. They breathe, move, and reproduce. All of these functions were made possible through the (10.) _________ they get from the nutrients acquired from their food. The food chain clearly describes how matter, in the form of (11.) _________, nitrogen, and other elements, is transferred from one organism to another. Matter, with the help of decomposers, is (12.) _________ in the ecosystem as they help return the nutrients to the soil and to the atmosphere. It also shows how energy (13.)_________ through it. In the food chain, energy flows in 12 (14.)______ direction as it travels from the producers to the consumers. Energy is released as (15.)_______ when organisms perform their life functions.

                            5. Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem. Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorised into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).
Producers include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.
Consumers or heterotrophs are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.
Secondary consumers depend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.
Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food. Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.
Quaternary consumers are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.
Decomposers include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter. Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.
Abiotic Components
Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem. It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc. 
Functions of Ecosystem
The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:
It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.
It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.
It maintains a balance among the various trophic levels in the ecosystem.
It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.
The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy.
So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:
Productivity – It refers to the rate of biomass production.
Energy flow – It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one trophic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.
Decomposition – It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.

It also helps us against the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun as it has an ozone layer that shields us from the harm it may cause. The (3.)_________ is composed of all the water bodies on earth. Water in its solid state, gaseous state or liquid state are all part of this sphere. It is essential because it is a major component of our body that drives chemical reactions that sustain all our metabolic activities. (4.)_________ is another sphere which provides soil with a lot of minerals that supply the plants’ needs for growth and development. It even holds the reservoir of fresh ground water, our source of safe drinking water. The four spheres are interlocking wonders as they keep the earth a livable planet. Human beings cannot live without the air, water, and the plants and animals which serve as food. These plants and animals also depend on the provision of necessary resources that keep them nourished to sustain their own metabolic functions. Plants (5.)_________. They depend on the resources they get from the spheres specifically (6._________) from the atmosphere, (7._________) from the hydrosphere and (8._________) from the geosphere. Animals (9.) _________ their food. They breathe, move, and reproduce. All of these functions were made possible through the (10.) _________ they get from the nutrients acquired from their food. The food chain clearly describes how matter, in the form of (11.) _________, nitrogen, and other elements, is transferred from one organism to another. Matter, with the help of decomposers, is (12.) _________ in the ecosystem as they help return the nutrients to the soil and to the atmosphere. It also shows how energy (13.)_________ through it. In the food chain, energy flows in 12 (14.)______ direction as it travels from the producers to the consumers. Energy is released as (15.)_______ when organisms perform their life functions.

The Ozone Layer</p><p>The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers. The lowest layer, the troposphere, extends from the Earth's surface up to about 6 miles or 10 kilometers (km) in altitude. Virtually all human activities occur in the troposphere. Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain on the planet, is only about 5.6 miles (9 km) high. The next layer, the stratosphere, continues from 6 miles (10 km) to about 31 miles (50 km). Most commercial airplanes fly in the lower part of the stratosphere.</p><p></p><p>Most atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a layer in the stratosphere, about 9 to 18 miles (15 to 30 km) above the Earth's surface (see the figure below). Ozone is a molecule that contains three oxygen atoms. At any given time, ozone molecules are constantly formed and destroyed in the stratosphere. The total amount has remained relatively stable during the decades that it has been measured.</p><p></p><br />
