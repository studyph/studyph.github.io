Yes, because more and more people will plant trees and engage to other environmental initiatives than ever before.b. No, because it is annoying to see a lot of people especially children playing outside, which results to noise pollution.c. Yes, because the more people, the more the merrier. That means, more people will help mitigate and combat the climate crisis today.d.

Yes, because it is what it is and it’s part of the natural order of things where we humans must consume and make use of the resources anytime and anywhere, we want.d. No, it will never be justifiable because there are lots of sustainable ways to manage and utilize the resources without any further degradation and harming of the environment.​</a>

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!"

                                            The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.

For many months, he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom,and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that it was all he wanted.As graduation day was approaching, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.He realized his father was very old and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Beforehe could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away and willed all of his possessions to hisson. He needed to come home immediately and took care of things.When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words... PAID IN FULL.How many times do we miss God's blessings because they are not packed as what we expected?~~~The EndI.

World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart. A dream running through our veins, thrilling our hearts and making them dance whenever we hear the command: "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another".My Relection1.

But out of crisis comes an outpouring of response to provide support for mental and well-being of those who are vulnerable and people in the Frontline during and after the covid-19 outbreak. it is hard to fight a battle when you cannot see the enemy. this is what makes everything so hard in this crisis we face. the lawmakers are lost with what to do. it's a hit &amp; miss situation when it comes to implementing guidelines. but there are so many people affected with the loss of jobs. the inability to earn a living, dependence in government subsidy and resources, which is so finite and scarce. so the vulnerable population has grown even more vulnerable and now, even the middle class are affected. as a humanitarian responder, I know I have to do something and I know I can do more. quarantine is not a hindrance.

                                            A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.

Man's Short Life and Foolish Ambition by Margaret Cavendish In gardens sweet each flower mark did I, How they did spring, bud, blow, wither, and die. With that, contemplating of man's short stay, Saw man like to those flowers pass away. Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high, As if he'd live to all Eternity. Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill His empty mind, but covet will he still. To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use! Wrong, right, or truth-no base ways will refuse. I would not blame him could he death out keep, Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep: Or buy Heaven's mansions-like the gods become, And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun: Command the winds to blow, seas to obey, Level their waves and make their breezes stay. But he no power hath unless to die, And care in life is only misery. This care is but a word, an empty sound, a Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, And all he has he leaves unto this spirit.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

                                            A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

                            19. The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart.

                            26. A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.

Man's Short Life and Foolish Ambition by Margaret Cavendish In gardens sweet each flower mark did I, How they did spring, bud, blow, wither, and die. With that, contemplating of man's short stay, Saw man like to those flowers pass away. Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high, As if he'd live to all Eternity. Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill His empty mind, but covet will he still. To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use! Wrong, right, or truth-no base ways will refuse.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

                            30. A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.
