How is the crystal formed?2. Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</a>

Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads</a>

Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</h2><br />

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
