                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Cell Wall. </strong>A cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some types of cells, just outside the cell membrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism.<strong>Cell Membrane. </strong>The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a double layer of lipids and proteins that surrounds a cell. It separates the cytoplasm (the contents of the cell) from the external environment. It is a feature of all cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.<strong>Chloroplasts. </strong>In plants, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane and contain a third inner membrane, called the thylakoid membrane, that forms long folds within the organelle.<strong>Ribosomes.</strong> A ribosome is a cell organelle. It functions as a micro-machine for making proteins. Ribosomes are composed of special proteins and nucleic acids. <strong>Mitochondria. </strong>Mitochondria are rod-shaped organelles that can be considered the power generators of the cell, converting oxygen and nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the chemical energy "currency" of the cell that powers the cell's metabolic activities.<strong>Centrioles. </strong>Centrioles are paired barrel-shaped organelles located in the cytoplasm of animal cells near the nuclear envelope. Centrioles play a role in organizing microtubules that serve as the cell's skeletal system.<strong>Nucleus. </strong>These membrane-bound structures are called organelles. In eukaryotes, the cell's genetic material, or DNA, is contained within an organelle called the nucleus, where it is organized in long molecules called chromosomes.Structurally, plant and animal cells are very similar because they are both eukaryotic cells. They both contain membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. Both also contain similar membranes, cytosol, and cytoskeletal elements.?<strong>Golgi. </strong>The Golgi apparatus is responsible for transporting, modifying, and packaging proteins and lipids into vesicles for delivery to targeted destinations. As the secretory proteins move through the Golgi apparatus, a number of chemical modifications may transpire.<br />
