Why is cost of production important?5. What are the main factors of production in Economics?Cost of production refers to the total sum of money needed to produce a particular quantity of output. As defined by Guthrie and Wallace, "In Economics, cost of production features a special meaning. It is all about the payments or expenditures essential to get the factors of production of land, labor, capital and management needed to produce a commodity It signifies the money costs which are to be incurred for acquisition of the factors of production in the words of Campbell, Production Costs are the costs which should be essentially received by resource owners so as to presume that they will continue to supply them in a specific period of timePlease Answer this </a>

</p><p>
</p><p>There are common special cases considered in Mathematics that give special products, these are the following:
</p><p>1. <strong>Multiplying the binomial (a + b) by itself
</strong></p><p>-Instead of executing the FOIL method [(a + b)(a + b)] in getting the answer, we can directly use a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
</p><p>2. <strong>Multiplying the binomial (a - b) by itself
</strong></p><p>-Instead of executing the FOIL method [(a - b)(a - b)] in getting the answer, we can directly use a^2 - 2ab + b^2.
</p><p>3. <strong>Multiplying binomials with an opposite operations but with the same terms
</strong></p><p>-In getting the answer of [(a + b)(a - b)], we can directly use a^2 - b^2.</p><br />
