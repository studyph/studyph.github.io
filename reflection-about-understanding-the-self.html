                                            Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

Textbook Lesson 3: The learner understands the human person as an embodied spirit REFLECTION: Take some time to look at your body in front of the mirror. Identify those parts you like most about your body. Identify those parts you hate the most. Write everything down in a tabulated form. One column for likes, another for dislikes. Now focus on the column of dislikes. For each item you write, focus on the things that you won't be able to do or miss if that body part is lost, destroyed or severely injured. Write at least one down for each body part you dislike. Going back to the same column of dislikes, think of your many achievements and ask your self whether or not it was possible to achieve those if the body parts you dislike were injured or permanently destroyed. Finally, think of all your dreams and aspirations. Ask your self if it is possible to achieve those dreams and aspirations if your disliked body part were injured or permanently destroyed. After asking your self these questions, write a long letter in a paper of reconciliation addressing your body expressing everything you fell about it.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Conflict is a deeply distressing sensation that makes a person feel as though their fundamental identity is being torn apart, which is psychologically what it is. An affiliative person's ties with other people make up who they psychologically are. Conflict gives us the chance to show a genuine version of ourselves to the outside world. Emotional well-being and effective communication are built on being able to speak the truth about ourselves even when we disagree.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self reflection is like looking into a mirror and describing what you see. It is a way of assessing yourself, your ways of working and how you study. To put it simply ‘reflection’ means to think about something. Reflecting and composing a piece of self reflective writing is becoming an increasingly important element to any form of study or learning</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Reflecting helps you to develop your skills and review their effectiveness, rather than just carry on doing things as you have always done them. It is about questioning, in a positive way, what you do and why you do it and then deciding whether there is a better, or more efficient, way of doing it in the future.</p><p></p><p>In any role, whether at home or at work, reflection is an important part of learning. You wouldn’t use a recipe a second time around if the dish didn’t work the first time would you? You would either adjust the recipe or find a new and, hopefully, better one. When we learn we can become stuck in a routine that may not be working effectively. Thinking about your own skills can help you identify changes you might need to make.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Understanding the self is a complex and multifaceted process that can take a lifetime to fully comprehend. At its core, understanding the self involves gaining insight into one's own thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors. This process can be aided by engaging in introspection, self-reflection, and therapy, among other things.</p><p></p><p>One of the key components of understanding the self is the ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions. Emotions are a natural and integral part of the human experience, and they play a vital role in how we perceive and navigate the world around us. By understanding our own emotions, we can gain insight into our own thoughts and behaviors, and we can better understand why we react to certain situations in the way that we do.</p><p></p><p>Another crucial aspect of understanding the self is the ability to understand and manage our own thoughts. Our thoughts are constantly shaping our perceptions of the world and our own experiences, and they can have a powerful influence on our emotions and behaviors. By gaining insight into our own thought processes, we can better understand why we think the way that we do, and we can learn to identify and challenge any negative or distorted thoughts that may be holding us back.</p><p></p><p>In addition to gaining insight into our own emotions and thoughts, understanding the self also involves developing a sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance. This means being able to recognize and accept our own strengths and weaknesses, as well as our own unique experiences and perspectives. By embracing ourselves fully and without judgment, we can begin to build a strong foundation of self-confidence and self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Overall, understanding the self is a lifelong process that requires effort, self-reflection, and a willingness to learn and grow. By gaining insight into our own emotions, thoughts, and experiences, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, and we can begin to live more authentic and fulfilling lives.</p><br />

                            22. Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

Textbook Lesson 3: The learner understands the human person as an embodied spirit REFLECTION: Take some time to look at your body in front of the mirror. Identify those parts you like most about your body. Identify those parts you hate the most. Write everything down in a tabulated form. One column for likes, another for dislikes. Now focus on the column of dislikes. For each item you write, focus on the things that you won't be able to do or miss if that body part is lost, destroyed or severely injured. Write at least one down for each body part you dislike. Going back to the same column of dislikes, think of your many achievements and ask your self whether or not it was possible to achieve those if the body parts you dislike were injured or permanently destroyed. Finally, think of all your dreams and aspirations. Ask your self if it is possible to achieve those dreams and aspirations if your disliked body part were injured or permanently destroyed. After asking your self these questions, write a long letter in a paper of reconciliation addressing your body expressing everything you fell about it.​</h2><br />
