                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>      Fuel is very important for everyday activities. Day-by-day our fuel deposits are depreciating. We need to save fuel to have a better environment around us. The real danger in consuming fuel thoughtlessly is that it is drying up the earth’s resources. Fossil fuels like coal and oil and gas are non-renewable resources. Increasing usage is depleting their presence within the earth. To save our environment, we need to save fuel.</p><p>      In today's world fuels are undoubtedly ruling our world.  Our basic needs are  Roti, Kapada and Makaan.  And, we need fuel to cook, to manufacture fabric, to produce building material and to build our sweet homes.  So willingly or unwillingly we are dependent on fuels to live. </p><p></p><p>     We use fossil fuels such as coal, wood, natural gas, Petroleum and its derivatives like petrol, diesel, LPG, kerosene etc.  Since the days of Industrial revolution, there has been a rapid growth and development in the entire globe.  The machines in industries, transport vehicles and domestic appliances all use fossil fuels.  Even though the world adopted electricity as a source of energy, we still need fossil fuels to produce electricity. </p><p>     </p><p>      Environment is an essential part of our life.  It includes surrounding water, air, trees, wildlife, birds, minerals etc.  Quality of our life depends on the quality of our environment.  Our health is dependent both on ourselves and our environment.  We need a clean environment to live healthy. </p><p> </p><p>     Last four decades have seen tremendous growth in electric and electronic gadgets and appliances causing the demand for energy to go skyrocketing.  Combustion of fossil fuels results in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have negative impact on environment and health.  Overuse of fuels have initiated a breakdown of our ecosystem balance. </p><p></p><p>     As a consequence air we breathe is polluted with CO2, soot particles and harmful gases.  A large number of people suffer from respiratory diseases.  The local temperatures have risen.  Climatic balance is broken.  Global warming is causing icebergs at the Poles and ice caps on mountain peaks to melt at a faster rate.</p><p></p><p>     Many species of birds and oceanic creatures are getting extinct.  Animals too suffer from pollution.  The balance in Biodiversity has become an issue.  Imbalance in food-chain results in Earth's ecosystem imbalance.Read more on Sarthaks.To live we eat food, drink water and breathe air.  If they are contaminated, then certainly our health is affected.  Comparing in our minds strolling happily on a path in a village and along a busy city road.  Certainly we would want a peaceful and clean environment for a morning walk to the park nearby.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       Music is considered food for the soul. It is also considered as medicine for a depressing soul or a tensed mind. Music has its different forms suiting different moods e.g. classical music, hip hop, rock and roll, blues, jazz, etc. Each of these music types has its own regional and cultural traditions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>   Classical music has its own noble history like the rest of the music types. Every culture and tradition has its own form of classical music that is played with the assistance of different instruments e.g. Indians, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans had their own traditions for classical music. Classical music is a broad, somewhat inexact term, referring to music produced, or rooted in the traditions of art, ecclesiastical and concert music. Music is classical if it includes some of the following features: a learned tradition, support from the church or government, or greater cultural capital. Classical music is also described as complex, lasting, transcendent, and abstract.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRANLIEST PO</p><p>THANKYOU</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Who is a student has often heard the proverb-‘the pen is mightier than the sword’. However, that does not mean that the pen is more powerful than the sword if two people are in a duel. It means that the symbolic significance of the pen is higher than that of the sword.</p><p></p><p>It also means that its shape, size or might can judge nothing in this world. As much as this proverb is held to be accurate, there are numerous examples where we might see that it does not work. In many cases, the sword turns out to be mightier than the pen. Here we have written two essays covering the topic for the benefit of students in their exams.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>          Music is considered food for the soul. It is also considered as medicine for a depressing soul or a tensed mind. Music has its different forms suiting different moods e.g. classical music, hip hop, rock and roll, blues, jazz, etc. Each of these music types has its own regional and cultural traditions.</p><p></p><p>          Classical music has its own noble history like the rest of the music types. Every culture and tradition has its own form of classical music that is played with the assistance of different instruments e.g. Indians, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans had their own traditions for classical music. Classical music is a broad, somewhat inexact term, referring to music produced, or rooted in the traditions of art, ecclesiastical and concert music. Music is classical if it includes some of the following features: a learned tradition, support from the church or government, or greater cultural capital. Classical music is also described as complex, lasting, transcendent, and abstract.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa branliest po thankyou</p><p>sana po makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Classical music is a genre that has been put down for years. This is so sad because there is way more to this type of music than people let on. Even to this day artists are composing new pieces for the modern era of classical music. This dying art form has been given the title of boring and lame. Yet why has it been around since medieval times, and that’s since around 1150ad. People need to realize that this art is more than just the notes on a page.</p><p></p><p>        In the early years of classical music’s beginnings it was connected with the church. This was known as Gregorian chants which are written as a singe music line. Not too much long later it turned into an organum, which is two or three lines of prose. Later in the renaissance era the music came with more freedom, which is kind of like modern melodies or harmonies. The use of a scale or key is introduced in the second half of the 16th century, and this is where we first start to affiliate to the term classical music. The next era is known as the Baroque time and this is where we see Johann Sebastian Bach come into the picture with minor modes. The genre continues to grow and morph through a few more forms known as Classical, Early Romantic, Romantic, and Post ‘Great War’ Years. This leads to today with the more modern and revolutionary music with more advancements in technology. This art form morphed over hundreds of years and it is still thriving today.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>THANKYOU<p>SANA MAKATULONG</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love comes in all forms. It would be wrong to say that a person cannot marry someone just because they are not from the opposite sex. The world is evolving more than ever and we need to keep up with times. Same-sex marriage is when any person chooses to marry the same sex instead of the opposite. We should not shun this concept anymore.</p><p>In other words, gone are the days when people had to be ashamed because of their sexuality. In today’s accepting world, we must make way for every human being irrespective of their gender. One needs to realize that there are more than two genders. The society needs to be more inclusive of all kinds of people. It will make the world a happier place when everyone feels they are accepted and appreciated.</p><p>All of us are human beings at the end of the day. Before labeling each other with the religion we follow or the people we choose to love. Everyone must realize this fact and act like it. Same-sex marriage is more than important in today’s time as the world is progressing.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>thnx me later pa brainlest na din hehe.</p><br />
