Historical approach seeks to understand a literary work by investigatingthe social, cultural, and intellectual context that produced it.2.

Historical research does not involve the careful study and analysis of dataabout past events.5. Historical Approach does not include critical investigation of events, theirdevelopment, experiences of past6. Reeder-response is a literary theory that discusses the important role of theauthor to unlock the meaning of the text.7. Examining, explaining, and defending one's personal reaction to a text arethe purposes of reader-response theory,8. Criticisms using reader-response theory should be based from theprinciples and form of the text/material itself.9. Connecting with the text is the biggest challenge in using reader-responsetheory.10.

Colors may just seem simple and unimportant, but they affect our daily lives more han we may know. If someone is feeling angry, it could just be because they're angry. or it could be perhaps that they are surrounded by or looking at the color red. That's right: People's moods can change just because they are looking at different colors There are many theories on how just a simple color can change one's whole mood According to Johnson (2007), color does affect mood by producing certain chemicals and stimulating different feelings such as hunger. For example, blue can make one leel calin because it releases calming chemicals, and red can make one hunen because it is an appetite stimulant. Yellow can make one feel irritated, and it isuren that people lose their iemper most in yellow rooms. However, pink is tranquilizing and can make one feel weak. In conclusion, Johnson says that depending on the color, one's body can do things like producing chemicals) that cause a certain emotional reaction (mad, sad, etc.). Another idea, by Sruith (2007), is that the effect color produces is based on what one's body does in response. For example, vellow is mentally stimulating, and activates memory, whereas red increases confidence. Also, brown can make a person fecl orderly and stable, while a dark blue can make one leel sad Therefore, Smith says that different colors do in fact change one s mood and the consequences can be negative or positive. I third writer Wollard. (2000) seems to think that color can alleet one's mood, but the effect also can depend on one's culture and what one's personal reflection may be for example, someone from Japan may not associate red with anger, as people from the US tend to do so a person who likes the color brown may Associate brown with happiness. However Holland does think that colors can make everyone feel the same, or close to the same mood. According to Wollard, pink reduces aggression, which is why the walls of the cells in the Seattle prison are pink! Also, brown can make one feel comforted. Wolland feels that colors do aficct oncs mood, but there are other factors that can alter that one supposed to feel Enc, John and Paraag' (2007) main point about color Example green makes people feel relaxed because it relaxes their muscles and makes sychology is that color has both physiological and psychological cflect. For them breathe deeper and more slowly. Furthermore blue lower blood pressure mood because of what it does to the body. Yet another idea by lucy (2000). is that which makes one fcel calm. Eric John, and Para conclude that color atlects ones is energy, and it can have a physical, mental, spiritual and or emotional effect can also make one feel depressed. Also brown can make a person feel reliable and people. He states that black anake one feel sophisticated and secure, but it can have dillerent kinds itellects all prople. color CO Q4 ENGLISH10 MODULE 1​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.Repetition in poetry as a literary device goes far beyond mere parroting of words. It gives drive to poetry, as it does for any song from primitive chant to hard rock; it is a unifying device that adds commentary to a poem's narrative; it solidifies and often alters meaning. It thereby adds change, development and meaning to a poem's theme.</p><p>2.Birth. The experience of being born into an unfamiliar world.</p><p>Time. The experience of progressing through time from past to present with no ability to go back from the current moment.</p><p>Space.</p><p>Sense &amp; Sensation.</p><p>Physical Experience.</p><p>Family.</p><p>Friendship.</p><p>Childhood.</p><p>3.In fiction writing, the basic definition of setting is the time and place of a story. But there are different elements that contribute to the creation of a setting, including:</p><p></p><p>Geographic location: A story might be set in a real-life, mappable place like a particular city, state, or country, or it might be set in an imaginary world. Learn more about worldbuilding in our guide here.</p><p>Physical location: A character’s immediate surroundings, like a room or a temple, can be important information to highlight.</p><p>Physical environment: A story can be set in the natural world where characters are affected by weather conditions, climate, and other forces of nature.</p><p>Time period: As a writer, it’s necessary to ask, “When does this story take place?” In literature, time period can be a historical period but it can also be a season, a time of day, or time of year.</p><p>Social and cultural environment: The location and time period will dictate the social and cultural environment in a story. If a short story is set in a high school, there will be societal norms and trends specific to teenagers. If a story is set in the late 1960s, it might be set against the cultural backdrop of the Vietnam War.</p><p></p><p>Yan lng alam ko hehe </p><p></p><br />

Additional Activity Read the text below and label the research below using the elements of restarch (Title, Introduction, Methodology, Results and Discussions, Conclusion and References) Color Psychology Paper How does color affect one's mood? Colors may just seem simple and unimportant, but they affect our daily lives more han we may know. If someone is feeling angry, it could just be because they're angry. or it could be perhaps that they are surrounded by or looking at the color red. That's right: People's moods can change just because they are looking at different colors There are many theories on how just a simple color can change one's whole mood According to Johnson (2007), color does affect mood by producing certain chemicals and stimulating different feelings such as hunger. For example, blue can make one leel calin because it releases calming chemicals, and red can make one hunen because it is an appetite stimulant. Yellow can make one feel irritated, and it isuren that people lose their iemper most in yellow rooms. However, pink is tranquilizing and can make one feel weak. In conclusion, Johnson says that depending on the color, one's body can do things like producing chemicals) that cause a certain emotional reaction (mad, sad, etc.). Another idea, by Sruith (2007), is that the effect color produces is based on what one's body does in response. For example, vellow is mentally stimulating, and activates memory, whereas red increases confidence. Also, brown can make a person fecl orderly and stable, while a dark blue can make one leel sad Therefore, Smith says that different colors do in fact change one s mood and the consequences can be negative or positive. I third writer Wollard. (2000) seems to think that color can alleet one's mood, but the effect also can depend on one's culture and what one's personal reflection may be for example, someone from Japan may not associate red with anger, as people from the US tend to do so a person who likes the color brown may Associate brown with happiness. However Holland does think that colors can make everyone feel the same, or close to the same mood. According to Wollard, pink reduces aggression, which is why the walls of the cells in the Seattle prison are pink! Also, brown can make one feel comforted. Wolland feels that colors do aficct oncs mood, but there are other factors that can alter that one supposed to feel Enc, John and Paraag' (2007) main point about color Example green makes people feel relaxed because it relaxes their muscles and makes sychology is that color has both physiological and psychological cflect. For them breathe deeper and more slowly. Furthermore blue lower blood pressure mood because of what it does to the body. Yet another idea by lucy (2000). is that which makes one fcel calm. Eric John, and Para conclude that color atlects ones is energy, and it can have a physical, mental, spiritual and or emotional effect can also make one feel depressed. Also brown can make a person feel reliable and people. He states that black anake one feel sophisticated and secure, but it can have dillerent kinds itellects all prople. color CO Q4 ENGLISH10 MODULE 1​</h2><br />
