If you have access to the Internet, you may use online or electronic sources of information. If connecting to the Internet is not possible, use non-electronic and print-based sources like newspapers, pamphlets, and/or posters. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Use the table provided. This classification includes original works like poems, diaries, court records, interviews, surveys, and original research and research published in scholarly and/or academic journals. Secondary Sources Sources of information are classified as secondary sources when they describe, interpret, or analyze primary sources. These are often information written or presented by authors who did not personally witness an event or occurrence. Common examples of secondary sources include materials like textbooks, magazine articles, book reviews, commentaries, and almanacs. Tertiary Sources Sources of information are considered tertiary sources when they are used to organize and locate primary and secondary sources. This classification includes indexes, abstracts, bibliographies, directories, and databases. It is also important to understand that definitions of each source type may vary from one context to another. Likewise, it is essential to take note of certain guideposts when using information gathered for activities like researching a topic, among others. Remember that information should always be accurate, reliable, up-to-date, consistent, relevant, and unique.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees.

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

If you have access to the Internet, you may use online or electronic sources of information. If connecting to the Internet is not possible, use non-electronic and print-based sources like newspapers, pamphlets, and/or posters. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Use the table provided. This classification includes original works like poems, diaries, court records, interviews, surveys, and original research and research published in scholarly and/or academic journals. Secondary Sources Sources of information are classified as secondary sources when they describe, interpret, or analyze primary sources. These are often information written or presented by authors who did not personally witness an event or occurrence. Common examples of secondary sources include materials like textbooks, magazine articles, book reviews, commentaries, and almanacs. Tertiary Sources Sources of information are considered tertiary sources when they are used to organize and locate primary and secondary sources. This classification includes indexes, abstracts, bibliographies, directories, and databases. It is also important to understand that definitions of each source type may vary from one context to another. Likewise, it is essential to take note of certain guideposts when using information gathered for activities like researching a topic, among others. Remember that information should always be accurate, reliable, up-to-date, consistent, relevant, and unique.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
