                                            Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, Word 1. overspread 2. returned 3. stupefied 4. carpet-bag 5. mackintosh 6. stout 7. native 8. chary 9. hitherto 10. wardrobes part of speech and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg. What do you think it means? What were your clues?​</a>

Girls of the She Noun, take up the pestle-stones;Then we sing Shwe Nyaung and chant itmerrily in time,As gracefully as we pound away. 2What means that noise, that bustle we hear?Oh, a lady of the She Noun is giving alms,With the music of drums and gongs.3There is red-gold radiance over there;Perhaps the sun has risen.No, it’s the dyed robes of the monksOn their rounds with their begging bowls.Come fill them with alms – food! 4This Chicrkransia which I plantedIsn’t it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stemsBut if you pluck them before they flower,My plant will wither away, you know.5Hey there, maiden at the loom,What cloth are you weaving?Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?It’s cotton coverlet for me.</a>

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style.

In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</a>

WOMAN WITH CHILDEmmanuel TorresAlready slow, so soon, she remarks funneling each wordWith her lips like a new ache: how far the hardwood doorIs from the stiff-backed chair where knitting needlesLie, the windows in various places all the time.Edges nudge; shapes are clumsy under her palm, exceptWhen they are round as porcelain teapots or saucers pinkWith Japanese blossoms, and as frail. Then, she is readyTo smile, and her hands refuse to tremble regarding Them. However, she is not brave to confront mirrors,As if her face would go blank with time’s concern:Leftovers spoiling fast, dishes stacked inThe skink, the faulty faucet dripping. Like passion,Pain can be untidy, leaving things half-done.He by the burly doorway pauses, cowedBy the blunt and patient labors of love.But today she is strong enough to forgive, though sky Is heavy with summer light and fliesSwarm round the refuse in the yard. Half-nakedBoys swing down the ravished mango tree in fear Of her; like monkey shadows (three little evils)They hide in privy corners, sitting on their haunches.Her temples throb anger. But the hurt passes,Moistens into cool sweat in this hot afternoonWith wind. Wordless by the window, he watches hermoveDown in the back lot among the hibiscus.She carries ably the double shapes of loveWithout excuse, regal as a virgin, whileShe reaps the wash from the sagging clothesline.But O,How the slender doves gather round her for feed,How her loose skirt in the wind swells and swells.

                            7. Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, Word 1. overspread 2. returned 3. stupefied 4. carpet-bag 5. mackintosh 6. stout 7. native 8. chary 9. hitherto 10. wardrobes part of speech and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.

WOMAN WITH CHILDEmmanuel TorresAlready slow, so soon, she remarks funneling each wordWith her lips like a new ache: how far the hardwood doorIs from the stiff-backed chair where knitting needlesLie, the windows in various places all the time.Edges nudge; shapes are clumsy under her palm, exceptWhen they are round as porcelain teapots or saucers pinkWith Japanese blossoms, and as frail. Then, she is readyTo smile, and her hands refuse to tremble regarding Them. However, she is not brave to confront mirrors,As if her face would go blank with time’s concern:Leftovers spoiling fast, dishes stacked inThe skink, the faulty faucet dripping. Like passion,Pain can be untidy, leaving things half-done.He by the burly doorway pauses, cowedBy the blunt and patient labors of love.But today she is strong enough to forgive, though sky Is heavy with summer light and fliesSwarm round the refuse in the yard. Half-nakedBoys swing down the ravished mango tree in fear Of her; like monkey shadows (three little evils)They hide in privy corners, sitting on their haunches.Her temples throb anger. But the hurt passes,Moistens into cool sweat in this hot afternoonWith wind. Wordless by the window, he watches hermoveDown in the back lot among the hibiscus.She carries ably the double shapes of loveWithout excuse, regal as a virgin, whileShe reaps the wash from the sagging clothesline.But O,How the slender doves gather round her for feed,How her loose skirt in the wind swells and swells.
