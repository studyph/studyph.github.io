Did such incident plant a seed of hate to the young Jose Rizal against Spanish government in the Philippines? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p>The incident that Rizal complained about to Governor General Primo de Rivera did not necessarily plant a seed of hate towards the Spanish government in the Philippines for young Jose Rizal. Rizal was known for his advocacy for reforms and equal treatment of Filipinos, rather than for promoting hate towards Spanish colonial rule. The incident could have influenced Rizal's later works, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices and corruption prevalent during Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. However, Rizal's works were written to promote change through peaceful means and to educate the people, rather than to incite hate.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal is a national hero and a prominent figure in Philippine history. He is known for his literary works that exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government during his time. However, he was charged with rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal in 1896. The question of whether he is guilty or not on the charges against him remains a controversial issue up to this day.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, some argue that Rizal is guilty of the charges against him. His association with the Katipunan and his involvement in the revolution against the Spanish colonial government could be seen as evidence of his guilt. Moreover, his writings, particularly the novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, were considered subversive and anti-colonial, which could further support the charges against him.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, others argue that Rizal is not guilty of the charges against him. They point out that Rizal was not directly involved in the revolution and that his writings were not meant to incite rebellion but to expose the injustices and corruption of the colonial government. Furthermore, Rizal's peaceful and non-violent approach to social change is well-documented, which contradicts the charges of rebellion and sedition against him.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the question of whether Dr. Jose Rizal is guilty or not on the charges against him by the Spanish military tribunal is a complex issue that requires a thorough understanding of the historical context and the evidence presented. While there are arguments for both sides, I personally believe that Rizal is not guilty of the charges against him. His writings and actions were driven by a desire for social justice and reform, not rebellion and sedition. Rizal's legacy as a national hero and a champion of freedom and democracy in the Philippines remains strong to this day.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines, was charged with rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal. The charges were based on his involvement in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule. While some argue that Rizal was guilty, I firmly believe that he was not.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Firstly, Rizal was a man of peace and advocated for reforms through peaceful means. He wrote numerous books and essays that exposed the injustices of the Spanish colonial government and called for reforms in the Philippines. He was not a revolutionary leader nor did he participate in any violent activities. His only involvement in the revolution was through his association with the Katipunan, a secret society that aimed to overthrow Spanish rule. However, Rizal was unaware of the group's violent intentions and had no direct involvement in their activities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Secondly, Rizal's trial was a sham. He was not given a fair trial and was not allowed to defend himself properly. The evidence presented against him was weak and circumstantial. The Spanish authorities were determined to silence Rizal, who they saw as a threat to their colonial rule. His trial was a clear example of the Spanish government's abuse of power and disregard for human rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Dr. Jose Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him by the Spanish military tribunal. He was a peaceful reformist who advocated for change through peaceful means. His trial was a clear violation of his rights and was a result of the Spanish government's fear of losing their grip on the Philippines. Rizal's legacy as a national hero lives on, and his contributions to the Philippine Revolution will always be remembered.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>answer with knowledge and valid opinions to help and guide the questioners‚ no copies from anyone or any website‚ pa brainliest.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>José Rizal</p><p>1861-1896</p><p>José Rizal, son of a Filipino father and a Chinese mother, came from a wealthy family. Despite his family's wealth, they suffered discrimination because neither parent was born in the peninsula. Rizal studied at the Ateneo, a private high school, and then to the University of St. Thomas in Manila. He did his post graduate work at the University of Madrid in 1882. For the next five years, he wandered through Europe discussing politics wherever he went. In 1886, he studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg and wrote his classic novel Noli me Tangere, which condemned the Catholic Church in the Philippines for its promotion of Spanish colonialism. Immediately upon its publication, he became a target for the police who even shadowed him when he returned to the Philippines in 1887. He left his country shortly thereafter to return to Spain where he wrote a second novel, El Filibusterismo (1891), and many articles in his support of Filipino nationalism and his crusade to include representatives from his homeland in the Spanish Cortes.</p><p></p><p>He returned to Manila in 1892 and created the Liga Filipina, a political group that called for peace change for the islands. Nevertheless, Spanish officials were displeased and exiled Rizal to the island of Mindanao. During his four years there, he practiced medicine, taught students, and collected local examples of flora and fauna while recording his discoveries. Even though he lost touched with others who were working for Filipino independence, he quickly denounced the movement when it became violent and revolutionary. After Andrés Bonifacio issued the Grito de Balintawak in 1896, Rizal was arrested, convicted of sedition, and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896.</p><p></p><p>Following the revolution, Rizal was made a saint by many religious cults while the United States authorities seized on his non-violent stance and emphasized his views on Filipino nationalism rather than those of the more action-oriented Emilio Aguinaldo and Andrés Bonifacio.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>mark me brainliest</p><br />

                            18. Construct a 3-paragraph Critical Essay on your judgment of Dr. Jose Rizal, whether he is guilty or not on the charges against him by the Spanish military tribunal. Justify your stand.</h2><br />
                        <p>Jose Rizal, the Philippine national hero, was charged with sedition, rebellion, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal in 1896. His trial and subsequent execution sparked a wave of nationalism and resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. While opinions on Rizal's guilt or innocence remain divided, it is my belief that Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Rizal's writings and actions were not aimed at inciting rebellion or sedition against the Spanish government. Instead, they were focused on exposing the injustices and inequalities of the colonial system and advocating for reforms through peaceful means. Rizal was a staunch believer in education and enlightenment as the key to achieving social and political progress, and he emphasized the need for Filipinos to work together and build a sense of national identity and pride.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Rizal's trial was marred by irregularities and violations of due process. He was not allowed to confront his accusers or defend himself adequately, and many of the witnesses against him were coerced or intimidated by the authorities. The charges against Rizal were also based on flimsy evidence and distorted interpretations of his writings.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while Rizal's trial and execution remain a controversial and contested part of Philippine history, my judgment is that Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him. His legacy as a national hero and champion of Philippine independence is a testament to his courage, intelligence, and vision for a better and more just society.</p><p></p><br />
