Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is schedule for a specific day and estimated time. On the day, the job is to be work on, materials orders have to be issue to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be reschedule. Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above.

Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</a>

                            11. 5. Making ice-cream is not easy. Cream and sugar have to first be mixed in a frozen container. Ingredients may be added at this point, if desired. The mixture must be stirred and whipped until the cream and sugar mixture is frozen. Depending on the equipment, this may take as long as an hour. After the ice-cream is prepared, it must be kept frozen until it is ready to be enjoyed. Making ice-cream is difficult, but most people would agree that it is worth the trouble.

                            14. The manager of a tool and die shop needs help win job processing and control. Jobs are currently process by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is schedule for a specific day and estimated time. On the day, the job is to be work on, materials orders have to be issue to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be reschedule. Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4.1 Historical Perspective</p><p>Good project management in construction must vigorously pursue the efficient utilization of labor, material and equipment. Improvement of labor productivity should be a major and continual concern of those who are responsible for cost control of constructed facilities. Material handling, which includes procurement, inventory, shop fabrication and field servicing, requires special attention for cost reduction. The use of new equipment and innovative methods has made possible wholesale changes in construction technologies in recent decades. Organizations which do not recognize the impact of various innovations and have not adapted to changing environments have justifiably been forced out of the mainstream of construction activities.</p><p></p><p>Observing the trends in construction technology presents a very mixed and ambiguous picture. On the one hand, many of the techniques and materials used for construction are essentially unchanged since the introduction of mechanization in the early part of the twentieth century. For example, a history of the Panama Canal construction from 1904 to 1914 argues that:</p><p></p><p>[T]he work could not have done any faster or more efficiently in our day, despite all technological and mechanical advances in the time since, the reason being that no present system could possibly carry the spoil away any faster or more efficiently than the system employed. No motor trucks were used in the digging of the canal; everything ran on rails. And because of the mud and rain, no other method would have worked half so well. [1]</p><p></p><p>In contrast to this view of one large project, one may also point to the continual change and improvements occurring in traditional materials and techniques. Bricklaying provides a good example of such changes:</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>hope it helps</strong><br />

</p><p>when an exact answer is not necessary?
</p><p>A. Assumption B. Estimation C. Prediction D. Solution</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The correct answer is letter B. The term that the statement above is referring to is called estimation.
</p><p>2. Estimate the product of 4.8 and 7.
</p><p>A. 25 B. 30 C. 35 D. 40</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The correct answer is letter C. The estimate product of 4.8 and 7 is 35.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>First is we have to round off 4.8 to the nearest whole number. Since the number to the right of whole number is 8 which belongs to "5 or more", hence we will round up 4.8 to 5. And since by multiplying 5 and 7, the product is 35, then the answer is 35.
</p><p>3. If 3.5 kg of mango cost 344.75, how much does a kilogram cost?
</p><p>A. 99.8 B. 98.5 C. 87.5 D. 68.2</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The correct answer is letter B. 98.5.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>We can obtain the price of a kilogram of mango when we divide 344.75 by 3.5 which will yield 98.5. Let us assume that the currency is in Philippine peso, so a kilogram of mangoes costs 98.50 pesos.
</p><p>4. If there are four horses and three people. How many feet are there in all?
</p><p>A. 19 ft B. 20 ft C. 22 ft D. 25 ft​</p><p>Answer: The correct answer is letter B. There are 20 feet all in all.</p><p>Solution: Let us assume that the people and horses are physically complete and none of their feet were amputated. Since horses have 4 feet while people have two, then: 4x4 is 16 and 3x2 is 6. There are 16 feet for horses and 6 for people. Adding them altogether, we have 20 feet in total.</p><p></p><p>Read more about estimations:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4089310</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST </strong></p><br />

                            19. The manager of a tool and die shop needs help win job processing and control. Jobs are currently process by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is schedule for a specific day and estimated time. On the day, the job is to be work on, materials orders have to be issue to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be reschedule. Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also use to charge back time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed. The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order, but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker. QUESTION: Evaluate the scenarios above. Identify the problem causes, effect and solution to the problem.​</h2><br />
