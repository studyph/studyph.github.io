                                            The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.

                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

                            3. The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.

                            10. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well For me it's definitely Ki because even though unarmed and with a bad foot condition his ready to save/, sacrifice himself for his wife.</p><br />

</p><p>• A clause is a group of words with a subject-verb unit; the 2nd group of words contains the
</p><p>subject-verb unit the bus goes, so it is a clause.
</p><p>• A phrase is a group of words without a subject-verb unit. If we try to change the time or tense of
</p><p>the lst group of words, we cannot, because it contains no word that changes to show time or
</p><p>tense. It has no verb, so it can't have a subject-verb unit. It is a phrase.
</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>HOW TO FIND A PHRASE vs A CLAUSE</strong>
</p><p>To find out if a group of words is a complete sentence, you can use this trick: Add Is it true that before the
</p><p>words. If the question does not make sense, the group of words is a sentence fragment. If the question
</p><p>does make sense, the group of words is a complete sentence. Consider the examples below.
</p><p>1. Is it true that the bus to Eastmont Mall?
</p><p>2. Is it true that the bus goes to Eastmont Mall?
</p><p> The first question above does not make sense. It does have a subject (“the bus”). But it does not have a
</p><p>verb, and it is not a complete idea. It is a phrase, and hence a sentence fragment.
</p><p> However, the second question does make sense. It has a subject and a verb and is a complete idea.
</p><p>Therefore, “The bus goes to Eastmont Mall” is clause, and it is also a complete sentence.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />

                            26. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.
