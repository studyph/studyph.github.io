The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

Cultural changes constantly throughout the time. It varies on the societal structure and the capacities of its members to respond.5. Culture is learned with practice through continued process. It is a lifelong process in which social interaction  plays in vital role.6. Culture to be always functioning must maintain its components integrated.

People have many varied reasons for protecting wildlife from extinction. One of these is economic. Some people think of the economic value of wildlife, such as the income that may be derived from rattan, orchids, and other forms of wildlife. There is also the need to find additional sources of food for the ever-increasing population. Another reason is artistic Artists and nature lovers think of the beauty of the different forms of wildlife. A third reason is genetic-based. People who study genetics think of the uniqueness of each species. Once the species become extinct, the peculiar combination of hundreds of characters will never be available again. A fourth reason is ecology-based. Ecologists think of the role played by the wildlife species in maintaining ecological balance. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forestlands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. More areas had to be cleared of trees to give more space for houses, schools, offices, roads, and other structures. As eir natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles, and other animals. Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them for our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspa- pers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rain water. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Read the paragraph. Circle the topic sentence, then copy the supporting​</a>

The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

                            4. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

                            8. D. C. 15, 14. Read each paragraph. On your paper, identify and write the main idea of the paragraph and copy the key sentence. 13. People have many varied reasons for protecting wildlife from extinction. One of these is economic. Some people think of the economic value of wildlife, such as the income that may be derived from rattan, orchids, and other forms of wildlife. There is also the need to find additional sources of food for the ever-increasing population. Another reason is artistic Artists and nature lovers think of the beauty of the different forms of wildlife. A third reason is genetic-based. People who study genetics think of the uniqueness of each species. Once the species become extinct, the peculiar combination of hundreds of characters will never be available again. A fourth reason is ecology-based. Ecologists think of the role played by the wildlife species in maintaining ecological balance. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forestlands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. More areas had to be cleared of trees to give more space for houses, schools, offices, roads, and other structures. As eir natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles, and other animals. Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them for our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspa- pers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rain water. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Read the paragraph. Circle the topic sentence, then copy the supporting​</h2><br />
