                                            .It is a kind of dimension where every object, regardless of it's shape, has three overall dimensions (height, width and depth)2. it refers to a graduated measurement to allow production of a drawing to any size desired3. a commonly used scale which has a radio of 1:1 which means that 1mm. on the drawing represents 1 mm. of the actual object4. it is a dimensioning method where all dimensions are placed a line with the dimensions life and be read from either the bottom or right side of the paper5. it is also a commonly used scale where the views of the actual object are twice the size of the views on the drawing paper6. this term refers to a size or distance in comparison to another7. it is a type of enlarged scale which means that in every 5 mm. on the drawing represents 1 mm. on the actual object8. most drafting skills are equipped with this kind of scales to aid the drafter in reducing an object on a drawing in a different or proportion9. this refers to the process of placing sizes and related information on a drawing10. this tool helps the drafter to reduce or enlarge the drawing of an object in proportion to its actual size11. it is a kind of dimension that provides size or location information concerning any feature or details of an object other than its overall dimension12. it refers to a process where it gives the detail and overall sizes of the object13. it is a dimensioning method where dimensions are placed so they can be made from the bottom of the drawing sheet and commonly used in mechanical drafting14. it is a type of in large-scale where the views on the drawing paper are twice the size of those on the actual object15. this is refers to a dimension that merely locates part or parts and feature of the object​​</a>

                                            .It is a kind of dimension where every object, regardless of it's shape, has three overall dimensions (height, width and depth)2. it refers to a graduated measurement to allow production of a drawing to any size desired3. a commonly used scale which has a radio of 1:1 which means that 1mm. on the drawing represents 1 mm. of the actual object4. it is a dimensioning method where all dimensions are placed a line with the dimensions life and be read from either the bottom or right side of the paper5. it is also a commonly used scale where the views of the actual object are twice the size of the views on the drawing paper6. this term refers to a size or distance in comparison to another7. it is a type of enlarged scale which means that in every 5 mm. on the drawing represents 1 mm. on the actual object8. most drafting skills are equipped with this kind of scales to aid the drafter in reducing an object on a drawing in a different or proportion9. this refers to the process of placing sizes and related information on a drawing10. this tool helps the drafter to reduce or enlarge the drawing of an object in proportion to its actual size11. it is a kind of dimension that provides size or location information concerning any feature or details of an object other than its overall dimension12. it refers to a process where it gives the detail and overall sizes of the object13. it is a dimensioning method where dimensions are placed so they can be made from the bottom of the drawing sheet and commonly used in mechanical drafting14. it is a type of in large-scale where the views on the drawing paper are twice the size of those on the actual object15. this is refers to a dimension that merely locates part or parts and feature of the object​​</a>
