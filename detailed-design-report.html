Do it on your notebook. Why are Hawksbill turtle endangered? People kill them for shells. Many find their shells with their unusual colors and designs attractive. People also hunt them for their meat. In many countries, turtle meat is a delicacy. I wonder what turtle meat tastes like! They are also hunted for their eggs and some even kill them to make turtle soup. In Asian countries, the turtle is used as medicine. Even if people don't try to catch these turtles, they die because of the pollution of the ocean. We pollute the waters with garbage, non bio-degradable objects and even chemicals.
