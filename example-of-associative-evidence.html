                                            has been linked to body image attitudes and correlates of body image (e.g., dieting and motivation for exercise), both directly and indirectly. Among men, higher levels of neuroticism have been associated with lower levels of appearance satisfaction and higher appearance investment and schematicity. Furthermore, there is evidence of an indirect or moderating effect of neuroticism on body image attitudes in men. For example, neuroticism has been shown to moderate the relationship between gender-role orientation and body image in men. Contrary to most research examining gender role and body image, some research has revealed femininity to be related to body satisfaction for men. Specifically, neuroticism has been shown to interact with femininity in predicting positive body ratings. The relationship between femininity and body satisfaction existed only when men had a low level of neuroticism: as neuroticism increased, the relationship diminished. pa help po .

                            22. has been linked to body image attitudes and correlates of body image (e.g., dieting and motivation for exercise), both directly and indirectly. Among men, higher levels of neuroticism have been associated with lower levels of appearance satisfaction and higher appearance investment and schematicity. Furthermore, there is evidence of an indirect or moderating effect of neuroticism on body image attitudes in men. For example, neuroticism has been shown to moderate the relationship between gender-role orientation and body image in men. Contrary to most research examining gender role and body image, some research has revealed femininity to be related to body satisfaction for men. Specifically, neuroticism has been shown to interact with femininity in predicting positive body ratings. The relationship between femininity and body satisfaction existed only when men had a low level of neuroticism: as neuroticism increased, the relationship diminished. pa help po .
