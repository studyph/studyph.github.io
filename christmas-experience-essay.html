<p><strong>Christmas</strong> is the most awaited season of almost all people in the world especially the children. We expect receiving and giving gifts during this time. <strong>Christmas vacation</strong> also means time out from classes and temporarily goodbye to early waking up in the morning.</p><p></p><p>I feel very satisfied and happy about my <strong>Christmas vacation</strong>. We had family reunion and I was able to see my cousins from far and near again. We ate delicious food and we played games. In<strong> Christmas</strong> eve, Mother and Ate cooked food for media noche. There were ham, spaghetti, chicken salad, chicken joy and ice cream on our table. I think all my favorites were served during that night. Mother and father also gave us gifts and we opened the gifts together after eating. Ate, kuya and I also gave our gifts to Mama and Papa. We also offered them songs and dance for entertainment. In some other days, we went to different beaches everyday and felt the fresh air while enjoying the scenery. We visited grandma and grandpa in the province and we had our new year there. I could say that we’ve done and enjoyed many activities during the <strong>Christmas vacation.  </strong></p><p></p><p>Starting today,I will save money in my piggy bank so I can buy more gifts when <strong>Christmas</strong> will come again this year. Mama said, it is a season for giving though everyday is also okay. If I have money in December, I can also give something to my cousins if we meet in the reunion again.</p><p></p>HOW TO WRITE AN ESSAY

                        The Christmas party with my classmates was one of the most memorable experiences of my academic life. It was a fun-filled event that brought together students from different grades, backgrounds, and interests. We had been looking forward to the party for weeks and the day finally arrived.<br /><br />The party was held in the school hall, which was beautifully decorated with colorful balloons, streamers, and Christmas lights. The festive ambiance immediately put us in the holiday spirit. The tables were adorned with red and green tablecloths, and there were platters of delicious food and drinks on every table.<br /><br />As soon as everyone arrived, we started playing games like Secret Santa, White Elephant, and Christmas charades. It was heartwarming to see everyone laughing and having a good time, forgetting about the stress of schoolwork and exams for a while. The highlight of the party was the talent show, where students showcased their singing, dancing, and acting skills.<br /><br />The event was also an opportunity for us to give back to the community. We had organized a donation drive where students brought gifts and food items that were donated to the local shelter. It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot to those in need.<br /><br />As the night went on, we continued to dance, eat, and play games. The DJ played a mix of Christmas songs and popular hits, and everyone was on their feet, dancing and singing along. It was a night of joy, happiness, and togetherness.<br /><br />The Christmas party with my classmates was more than just a fun event. It brought us together, strengthened our bonds, and reminded us of the importance of giving back to the community. It was a night I will always cherish and a memory that will stay with me forever.<br />

                            12. give me essay different between 2021 Christmas and 2022 Christmas​</h2><br />
                        <p>Christmas is a special time of year that is full of celebration, family, and cheer. It is a time when people come together to exchange gifts, spend time with loved ones, and remember the birth of Jesus Christ. While Christmas is a holiday that is celebrated every year, there can be some differences in how it is celebrated from one year to the next. For example, the way that people celebrated Christmas in 2021 may have been different from how they will celebrate it in 2022. In this essay, we will explore the potential differences between 2021 Christmas and 2022 Christmas.</p><p></p><p>One major difference between these two Christmases is the way that people will be able to celebrate. In 2021, many people were unable to celebrate Christmas in the usual way due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that people had to find new ways to celebrate, such as having virtual gatherings or socially distanced celebrations. However, in 2022, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic will have subsided, allowing people to celebrate Christmas in a more traditional way. This could mean that people will be able to gather in person with their loved ones, travel to see family and friends, and enjoy more of the traditional activities that they may have missed in 2021.</p><p></p><p>Another potential difference between 2021 Christmas and 2022 Christmas is the availability of certain items. In 2021, the pandemic caused disruptions in supply chains, making it more difficult for people to find certain items, such as Christmas decorations and gifts. However, in 2022, it is likely that these disruptions will have been resolved, allowing people to more easily find the items they need to celebrate Christmas.
