                    <p>Three rabbits lived in a small garden. The white rabbit was big.The brown rabbit was bigger than the white rabbit. The gray rabbit was the biggest of the three. Three rabbits lived in a small garden. The white rabbit was big. The brown rabbit was bigger than the white rabbit. The gray rabbit was the biggest of the three.         One day, they found three carrots on the ground. &quot;I will eat the carrots&quot;, said the white rabbit in a loud voice. &quot;I will eat the carrots all alone&quot;, said the brown rabbit in a louder voice. &quot;I will eat it all myself&quot;, said the gray rabbit in a loudest voice.         A wise monkey lived in a tree nearby. He was wiser than the rabbits. In fact, he was the wisest monkey in the world. Why? When the monkey heard what the rabbits said, he hurriedly went to the garden. The three rabbits were busy fighting among themselves and they didn&#039;t see the monkey. The monkey snatched and ate up all the carrots.        At last stopped fighting. &quot;Where were the carrots?&quot; the three rabbits said. &quot;It ran away because you made so much noise,&quot; said the monkey.         From then, the three rabbits learned to keep an eye and never argued on something. 1.Did you enjoy listening to the story? 2.Do you think that fighting each other just like what the three rabbits did is a good deed? 3. If you were the monkey, would you take advantage of the situation and do the same?​</p>

Three rabbits lived in a small garden. The white rabbit was big. The brown rabbit was bigger than the white rabbit. The gray rabbit was the biggest of the three.         One day, they found three carrots on the ground. "I will eat the carrots", said the white rabbit in a loud voice. "I will eat the carrots all alone", said the brown rabbit in a louder voice. "I will eat it all myself", said the gray rabbit in a loudest voice.         A wise monkey lived in a tree nearby. He was wiser than the rabbits. In fact, he was the wisest monkey in the world. Why? When the monkey heard what the rabbits said, he hurriedly went to the garden. The three rabbits were busy fighting among themselves and they didn't see the monkey. The monkey snatched and ate up all the carrots.        At last stopped fighting. "Where were the carrots?" the three rabbits said. "It ran away because you made so much noise," said the monkey.         From then, the three rabbits learned to keep an eye and never argued on something. 1.Did you enjoy listening to the story? 2.Do you think that fighting each other just like what the three rabbits did is a good deed? 3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>She has two chickens.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Consider all that she owns-- rabbits, kittens, and chickens. It is useful to visualize the problem, so try listing it, like I did below. Then analyze the three statements:</p><p>All of them are rabbits except three. This means there are three animals that are either kitten or chickens. I distribute the number equally to the number of kitten and chickens. I can adjust the number later to suit the statements. Then, repeat for all statements and make sure all of them are true at once.</p><p>Rabbits: 2</p><p>Kittens: 1</p><p>Chickens: 2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lets start with the food chain, which is a series of organisms each dependent on the next as a source. Food chains start with a produce, an organism that is able to make its own food (ex: plant). Another name for a producer is an autotroph. If you notice the arrows are pointing in the direction of energy travel. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Mark</p><p>me</p><p>as</p><p>brainliest</p><p>please</p><br />
