                                            The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</a>

                            6. The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</h2><br />

That is, this inductive paragraph puts the main idea or main idea at the end of the paragraph. Meanwhile, the beginning of this inductive paragraph is filled with explanations or supporting sentences that clarify the topics discussed to get general conclusions first.</p><p>One of the challenges presented in writing inductive paragraphs is that the writer is required to be able to provide an overview that directs the reader to be able to read to the final conclusion. One of the requirements for writing inductive paragraphs is to write conjunctions or conjunctions so that each sentence can be interconnected or continuous.
