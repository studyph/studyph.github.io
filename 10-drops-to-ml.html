                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The toxic effects of mercury depend on its chemical form and the route of exposure. Methylmercury [CH3Hg] is the most toxic form. It affects the immune system, alters genetic and enzyme systems, and damages the nervous system, including coordination and the senses of touch, taste, and sight.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. Mercury is considered by WHO as one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern.</p><br />

                            29. Q1. What is the taste of the resulting mixture? Q2. Think about sugar and water as made up of tiny particles. Give your reason(s) for the observations you made in Q1. You may draw illustrations to further explain your reason(s). Q3. What is the volume of the sugar and water mixture? Q4. Is the volume of the resulting sugar mixture equal, more than or less than the sum (10 mL sugar + 40 mL water) Q5. Describe what you have observed after adding the food coloring. Q6. What happened to the food coloring dropped in the bottle containing water? Q7. Think about food coloring and water as made up of particles, give your reason(s) for the observations you made in Q6. You may draw illustrations to further explain your reason(s).​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong>When you mixed sugar and water and tasted the resulting solution ,it tasted sweet because sugar is still present, though you cannot see the sugar anymore.</p><p>2.Tiny particles make up both sugar and water. They're important. Both are made up of atoms and molecules. The sugar is solidified. The water is in a state of liquidation. In comparison to water, which is a liquid with less compact particles, sugar is a solid with more compact particles.</p><p>When sugar is dissolved in water, the crystals of sugar dissolve in a particular length of time. You prepare a sugar-water solution. Sugar dissolves into the drink and is practically unnoticeable. As a result, sugar can be dissolved in water.</p><p>3.The volume of the water will remain the same</p><p>4.In the beginning, you might imagine that simply adding 20 ml sugar to 50 ml water will result in a larger amount.</p><p></p><p>The resulting mixture, however, will have a smaller volume than the total of the unmixed components' volumes due to the atoms that make up these two substances. </p><p>5.The food coloring scattered in the water as it molecules fits in.</p><p>6.Because the specific gravity, or relative density, of food coloring is somewhat higher than that of water, it tends to sink in the water before it has time to diffuse.</p><p>7.You might make the following observations if you were to add the food coloring to the water:</p><p></p><p>°In the water, the food coloring particles progressively dispersed.</p><p></p><p>°The water becomes a shade of brown after a while.</p><p></p><p>We may say that the particles of matter were constantly moving if we conceive of food coloring and water as being made up of particles based on the activity and what we see. When you add the food coloring to the water, you can see that it is gently spreading throughout the water until it is colored.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
