A Glass Of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

A Glass of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

A Glass of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.
