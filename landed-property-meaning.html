                                            B. Paraphrase the text below.There are many man-made causes of global warming. Pollution is one of the biggest man-made problems.Pollution comes in many shapes and sizes. Burning fossil fuels is one thing that causes pollution. Fossil fuelsare fuels made of organic matter such as coal, or oil. When fossil fuels are burned they give off a greenhousegas called CO2. Also, mining coal and oil allows methane to escape. Another major man-made cause ofGlobal Warming is population. More people mean more food, and more methods of transportation. Thattmeans more methane because there will be more burning of fossil fuels, and more agriculture. Anothersource of methane is manure. Because more food is needed to feed the population, we have to raise food.Animals like cows are a source of food which means more manure and hence more methane. Anotherproblem with the increasing population is transportation. More people mean more cars, and more cars meanmore pollution. Also, many people have more than one car. Also, the trees that convert our CO2 to oxygemare being cut down because we are using the land that we cut the trees down from as property for ounthomes and buildings. We are not replacing the tree, so we constantly taking advantage of our maturallresources and giving nothing back in return.​</a>

                            13. B. Paraphrase the text below.There are many man-made causes of global warming. Pollution is one of the biggest man-made problems.Pollution comes in many shapes and sizes. Burning fossil fuels is one thing that causes pollution. Fossil fuelsare fuels made of organic matter such as coal, or oil. When fossil fuels are burned they give off a greenhousegas called CO2. Also, mining coal and oil allows methane to escape. Another major man-made cause ofGlobal Warming is population. More people mean more food, and more methods of transportation. Thattmeans more methane because there will be more burning of fossil fuels, and more agriculture. Anothersource of methane is manure. Because more food is needed to feed the population, we have to raise food.Animals like cows are a source of food which means more manure and hence more methane. Anotherproblem with the increasing population is transportation. More people mean more cars, and more cars meanmore pollution. Also, many people have more than one car. Also, the trees that convert our CO2 to oxygemare being cut down because we are using the land that we cut the trees down from as property for ounthomes and buildings. We are not replacing the tree, so we constantly taking advantage of our maturallresources and giving nothing back in return.​</h2><br />
