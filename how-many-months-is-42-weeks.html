Using the rate, how much can restaurant earn in 7 days? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Part 2:</p><p></p><p>To solve for x in the proportion 2:3 = 12:x, you can cross-multiply to get: 2x = 36. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 18, so the value of x is 18.</p><p></p><p>To solve for x in the proportion 4:7 = x:21, you can cross-multiply to get: 7x = 84. Dividing both sides by 7 gives x = 12, so the value of x is 12.</p><p></p><p>To solve for x in the proportion 24:x = 6:11, you can cross-multiply to get: 24x = 66. Dividing both sides by 24 gives x = 2.75, so the value of x is 2.75.</p><p></p><p>To solve for x in the proportion x:25 = 75:15, you can cross-multiply to get: 15x = 1875. Dividing both sides by 15 gives x = 125, so the value of x is 125.</p><p></p><p>To solve for x in the proportion x:3 = 75:x, you can cross-multiply to get: 3x = 75x. Dividing both sides by 3x gives x = 1/3, so the value of x is 1/3.</p><p></p><p>Part 3:</p><p></p><p>The ratio of working hours of James and John is 3:5. If James worked for 42 hours in one week, you can use this ratio to find the number of hours John worked by setting up the proportion 3/5 = 42/x and solving for x. Cross-multiplying gives 3x = 210, and dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 70. This means that John worked for 70 hours in one week.</p><p></p><p>The ratio of the monthly revenues of the two store outlets is 7:6. If you know the monthly revenue of the store outlets at JJJ mall, you can use this ratio to find the monthly revenue of the store outlets at RRR mall by setting up the proportion 7/6 = x/y and solving for y. If the monthly revenue of the store outlets at JJJ mall is P100,000, then you can substitute this value for x in the proportion to get 7/6 = 100,000/y. Cross-multiplying gives y = 116,666.67, so the monthly revenue of the store outlets at RRR mall is P116,666.67.</p><p></p><p>Peter and Andrew received a total of P22,500 overtime pay during the month of December, and the ratio of overtime hours was 2:3. You can use these values to find the amount of overtime pay each of them received by setting up the proportion 2/3 = x/(22,500-x) and solving for x. Cross-multiplying gives 3x = 45,000 - 2x, which simplifies to 5x = 45,000. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 9,000, so Peter received P9,000 in overtime pay. To find the amount of overtime pay Andrew received, you can subtract this value from the total amount of overtime pay to get P22,500 - P9,000 = P13,500.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine, Jasper, and Jordan sold a total of 840 dishwashing products in the ratio 4:5:6, respectively. To find the number of dishwashing products sold by each of them, you can set up the proportion 4/9 = x/840 and solve for x. Cross-multiplying gives 4x = 7,560, and dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 1890. This means that Jasmine sold 190 dishwashing products. To find the number of dishwashing products sold by Jasper and Jordan, you can use the same approach and set up the proportions 5/9 = x/840 and 6/9 = x/840, respectively. Solving these proportions gives x = 336 for Jasper and x = 280 for Jordan. This means that Jasper sold 336 dishwashing products and Jordan sold 280 dishwashing products.</p><p></p><p>The owner of a restaurant found out that they are earning approximately P32,400 every three days. To find the amount the restaurant can earn in 7 days, you can use the rate of P32,400 every three days to determine the daily earnings by dividing P32,400 by 3 to get P10,800 per day. Multiplying this value by 7 gives a total of P75,600 in earnings for 7 days.</p><br />
