Why</p><p></p><p>First of all you need to remember a very important thing ,</p><p></p><p>Two voltage sources can never be connected in parallel, they should be always connected in series</p><p></p><p>This is because voltage in parallel is always the same</p><p></p><p>Vice-versa is for a current source,</p><p></p><p>Two current sources should always be connected in parallel</p><p></p><p>Now, as per the question ,</p><p></p><p>A dry cell is a voltage source hence they need to be connected in series to each other</p><p></p><p>As shown in the attachment, they are connected in series and the net potential produced by the three dry cells would be,</p><p></p><p>V1 + V2 +V3</p><p></p><p>3V if the potential of the three cells are the same</p><p></p><p>2. Based on your drawing, give one advantage of the parallel circuit.</p><p></p><p>PARALLEL CIRCUIT</p><p></p><p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a parallel circuit?</p><p></p><p>• ADVANTAGES</p><p></p><p>1. All loads in parallel connection are directly connected to the voltage source.</p><p></p><p>2. In a parallel circuit, even if one of the light bulbs is damaged, all other light bulbs will function since the flow of current is not entirely interrupted.</p><p></p><p>3. Individual load in a parallel circuit is easy to control.</p><p></p><p>4. All light bulbs and appliances at home are connected in parallel. Switching off some appliances does not affect other appliances.</p><p></p><p>• DISADVANTAGES</p><p></p><p>1. Overloading may happen if appliances are simultaneously used at home.</p><p></p><p>2. A parallel connection is difficult to install, maintain, and repair since large volume of conducting wires is needed. When problem in the connection occurs, it is difficult to identify which loop among the many loops does not work.</p><p></p><p>3. It requires the use of several conducting wires of varying sizes.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p></p><br />

Mount a small piece on a slide, add a small drop of water, and stain the cells withtincture of iodine.3. Cover the specimen with a cover slip.4. Observe and draw one cell under low and high power. Observe the granularcytoplasm surrounding the clear vacuole. The nucleus is located in the cytoplasmclose to the cell wall. Draw a diagram of the features you can see5.

What does this tell you about the need forstaining cells before looking at them under a microscope?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.) Bulb plants like onions tend to store food in the form of sugar, rather than starch.</p><p>2.) Iodine is the best material that's widely used to recognize any traces of starch. (When iodine comes in contact of starchy foods, the transparent color changes into dark, bluish color</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: Although onions may not contain that much starch, the iodine still recognize small amounts of it as we can tell that there were color changes after a drop of iodine was placed in the onion that makes its individual cell more visible than not putting iodine in it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>DISEASE AFFECTS CELL<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Cells</strong> that help viral replication are called tolerant. Contaminations of tolerant <strong>cells</strong> are generally useful in light of the fact that irresistible offspring infection is delivered. Most useful contaminations are called cytocidal in light of the fact that they kill the host <strong>cell</strong>. Diseases of nonpermissive <strong>cells</strong> yield no irresistible descendants infection and are called unsuccessful. At the point when the total collection of infection qualities fundamental for infection replication isn't deciphered and converted into practical items the contamination is alluded to as prohibitive. In constant and in some changing diseases, viral nucleic corrosive might stay in explicit host cells endlessly; descendants infection could possibly be delivered.
</p><p>
</p><p>Disease by cytocidal infections is typically connected with changes in <strong>cell</strong> morphology, in <strong>cell </strong>physiology and successive biosynthetic occasions. Large numbers of these progressions are important for proficient infection replication.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>How does the disease affect the cell:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/57545</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The endoplasmic reticulum can either be smooth or rough, and in general its function is to produce proteins for the rest of the cell to function. The rough endoplasmic reticulum has on it ribosomes, which are small, round organelles whose function it is to make those proteins.</p><p>2.Known as the cell's “command center,” the nucleus is a large organelle that stores the cell's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The nucleus controls all of the cell's activities, such as growth and metabolism, using the DNA's genetic information.</p><p>3.A Golgi body, also known as a Golgi apparatus, is a cell organelle that helps process and package proteins and lipid molecules, especially proteins destined to be exported from the cell. Named after its discoverer, Camillo Golgi, the Golgi body appears as a series of stacked membranes.</p><p>4.A lysosome is a membrane-bound cell organelle that contains digestive enzymes. Lysosomes are involved with various cell processes. They break down excess or worn-out cell parts. They may be used to destroy invading viruses and bacteria.</p><p>5. Some different cells have different amounts of mitochondria because they need more energy.</p><p>6. Cytosol is the intra-cellular fluid that is present inside the cells. ... Cytosol is the part of the cytoplasm that is not held by any of the organelles in the cell. On.</p><p>7.In addition to providing a compartment for oxidation reactions, peroxisomes are involved in lipid biosynthesis. In animal cells, cholesterol and dolichol are synthesized in peroxisomes as well as in the ER. In the liver, peroxisomes are also involved in the synthesis of bile acids, which are derived from cholesterol.</p><p>8.Secretory vesicles play an important role in moving molecules outside of the cell, through a process called exocytosis. They are crucial for healthy organ and tissue function. For example, secretory vesicles in the stomach will transport protein-digesting enzymes to help break down food.</p><p>9.Kailangan mo daw Po mag drawing</p><p>10.Kailangan Mo daw Po mag drawing</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Sexual reproduction requires two parents. Each parent contributes a gamete - a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs.</p><p></p><p>2. In asexual reproduction all the genes in the offspring come from one parent. In sexual reproduction one full set of the genes come from each parent. Living things produce offspring of the same species, but in many cases offspring are not identical with each other or with their parents.</p><p></p><p>3. Asexual reproduction does not involve sex cells or fertilisation. Only one parent is required, unlike sexual reproduction which needs two parents. ... As a result, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent and to each other. They are clones.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yung number 4 kayo na lang po mag drawing hope it help naman kahit papano classmate ko</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Having now learned about the male and reproductive systems, compare and contrast the two.</p> <strong>In what ways are they similar?</strong> They are the same in that <strong>most of the reproductive organs of both sexes develop from similar embryonic tissue, meaning they are homologous. </strong>Both systems have gonads that produce (sperm and egg or ovum) and sex organs.<strong>Different?</strong>The male has reproductive organs, or genitals, that are both inside and outside the pelvis, while the female has reproductive organs entirely within the pelvis.<p></p><p>2. How do the male and female reproductive systems work with each other for human reproduction?</p><strong>The male gamete, or sperm, and the female gamete, the egg or ovum, meet in the female's reproductive system.</strong> When sperm fertilizes (meets) an egg, this fertilized egg is called a zygote (pronounced: ZYE-goat). The zygote goes through a process of becoming an embryo and developing into a fetus.<p></p><p>3. Differentiate the egg cell from the sperm cell by researching further.</p>Sperm and ovum are the gametes produced by vertebrates. More specifically, <strong>sperm is the male gamete while the ovum is the female gamete.</strong> These two cells also have contrasting size – for instance, the sperm is the smallest cell in the human body while the ovum is the largest.<p></p><p>4.Males have testosterone while females have estrogen and progesterone,Compare the functions of the three hormones.</p><p></p>it's just that women have more estrogen while men have more testosterone. Testosterone is an androgen, which is a “male” sex hormone that plays a role in reproduction, growth, and maintenance of a healthy body. In men, testosterone is mainly produced in the testes.The main reproductive hormones estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone are instrumental in sexuality and fertility. They are responsible for pregnancy, puberty, mensuration, menopause, sex drive, sperm production and more. These hormones are produced in the ovaries (in females) and testes (in males).<p></p><p>5.Describe/draw the journey that the sperm cells go through to exit the male body. Include the parts of the male reproductive system that sperm cells need to pass through.</p>The correct sequence for transport of sperm cells in male reproductive system is Seminiferous tubules → <strong>Rete testis → Vasa efferentia → Epididymis Vas deferens → Ejaculatory duct → Urethra → Urethral meatus.O</strong>Sperm cells pass through a series of ducts to reach the outside of the body. After they leave the testes, the sperm passes through the <strong>epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct, and urethra.</strong><p></p><p>6.Describe/draw the journey that the mature egg cell goes through while waiting for fertilization. Include the parts of the female reproductive system that it passes through.</p>The ovaries produce the egg cells, called the ova or oocytes. The oocytes are then transported to the fallopian tube where fertilization by a sperm may occur. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where the uterine lining has thickened in response to the normal hormones of the reproductive cycleA female's internal reproductive organs are the <strong>vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</strong> The vagina is a muscular, hollow tube that extends from the vaginal opening to the uterus.<p></p><p>7.How are the structures of the following organs important to the jobs they do? </p>a. Penis-the penis' structure enables itto as a tube from where urine and sperm can exit, and it's erectile and ejaculatory function enable it to server its purpose in sexual reproduction.b. <strong>Testes</strong><strong> </strong>- the testes are inside the scrotum in order to protect sperm cells, and also to maintain testicular temperature for spermatogenesis.c. <strong>Scrotum </strong>- the scrotum being outsidethe body enables it to maintain a temperature lower than core body temperature for maintenance of sperm.d. <strong>Ovaries</strong> - the ovaries being located at either side of the uterus enables egg cells to easily travel to the uterus.e. <strong>Fallopian tubes</strong> - These tubes attach the ovaries to the uterus, and the vagina, enables it to house and support an egg cell or a fetus.f. <strong>Uterus</strong> - being pear-shape and near other parts like the ovaries and the vagina, enables it to house and support and egg cell or a fetus.g. <strong>Vagina</strong> - it connects the uterusand cervix to the outside of the body, allowing for menstruation, reproduction,and childbirth.<p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps, pabrainliest po.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>study well.</p><br />
