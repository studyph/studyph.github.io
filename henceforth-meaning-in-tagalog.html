Preparing pasta requires common sense and imagination rather than complicated recipes. 12. Henceforth, the key to success is fresh ingredients for the sauce and perfectly cooked pasta. 13. Firstly, when cooking pasta, the cook should follow the package directions and should test the pasta before the cooking time is up. 14. Moreover, the sauce may contain just about any fresh fish, meat, cheese, herb, or vegetable 15. Likewise, the Italians who ought to know say that the pasta is done when the texture is neither tough nor mush but al dente, or "firm to bite."​</a>

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business.

                                            What polygon meaning?? A polygon is a two-dimensional geometric figure that has a finite number of sides. The sides of a polygon are made of straight line segments connected to each other end to end. Thus, the line segments of a polygon are called sides or edges. The point where two line segments meet is called vertex or corners, henceforth an angle is formed. An example of a polygon is a triangle with three sides. A circle is also a plane figure but it is not considered a polygon, because it is a curved shape and does not have sides or angles. Therefore, we can say, all the polygons are 2d shapes but not all the two-dimensional figures are polygons.We can observe different types of polygons in our daily existence and we might be using them knowingly or unknowingly.

                        <p></p>Various styles of eighteenth-century dance existed: ballroom, ballet, a number of traditional styles of theatrical dance, regional differences. The French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments. Other styles included the comic/ grotesque and mixtures of comic and serious. At the Académie Royale de Danse, where professional dancers, both male and female, were trained. The most distinctive features of the new style were the complex  use of arms raised in opposition to the foot, the turnout of legs and feet and a rise to mark the beginning of the step. An important discussion of the preliminary plié and rise is to be found in Ken Pierce’s article, ‘Saut what? (Sauts in early eighteenth century dance)’, Proceedings (Society of Dance History Scholars) 11th annual conference, 1988.<br />

Taking good notes help because on the test the teacher not only going to ask what was on PowerPoint also what he said verbally during the lecture. Organizing the class material helps because I can recall the stuff better when it’s organized. I use maintenance rehearsal to memorize or learn information. I would keep repeating information to myself until I totally get it into my mind and it helps me sometimes not all the time. I study in my room and several distractions are present such as my phone, my desktop, and people talking while I’m trying to study. Studying with friends use to help me but now it’s not that helpful it’s just a waste of time. With these habits, my performance in test scores results in moderate performance because I wait for the last minute to study, like I said above one of my study habit is mass practice.…show more content…</p><p>Space Practice will improve my memory because rather than studying nonstop before the test, it’s better that if I study for short periods of time rather than long periods of time. With this improvement, I will have some information in my mind before I review that same information again. It also helps my mind to keep information and recall it better when I need to. Another Improvement that I can use to improve my memory is overlearning the material. I didn’t quite do that until I learned it in your class. </p><p>I find myself using more of reading and writing than any other learning style in this class. To help myself retain the aural part of class, I take notes on key points, and doodle for the in between. The key-point notes help me to remember more of the topic being spoken of when I made the note, whereas doodles help keep my mind from wandering. That may seem a bit oxymoronic, but without doodling my brain goes off on its own tangents. Doodling sort of anchors me to pen, paper, and the lecture. I also enjoy and benefit from taking part in class discussions and speaking in front of the class. I find that when I speak in front of the class, or ask questions, I retain that information better. There are times in class where I can fall behind, or get a bit confused, and at this time I refer to the book to help get me back on course with the rest of the class. Assignments can also get me a bit confused. I try to review assignments beforehand, to have questions prepared. Then again in class I review the assignments, take notes on them, and ask questions.

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</h2><br />

                            20. What polygon meaning?? A polygon is a two-dimensional geometric figure that has a finite number of sides. The sides of a polygon are made of straight line segments connected to each other end to end. Thus, the line segments of a polygon are called sides or edges. The point where two line segments meet is called vertex or corners, henceforth an angle is formed. An example of a polygon is a triangle with three sides. A circle is also a plane figure but it is not considered a polygon, because it is a curved shape and does not have sides or angles. Therefore, we can say, all the polygons are 2d shapes but not all the two-dimensional figures are polygons.We can observe different types of polygons in our daily existence and we might be using them knowingly or unknowingly. In this article, you will the meaning and definition of a polygon, types of a polygon, real-life examples of polygon shapes along with their properties and related formulas in detail.Table of Contents:DefinitionShapeTypesRegular PolygonIrregular PolygonConvex PolygonConcave polygonAnglesPropertiesFormulasTrianglesQuadrilateralsNames of PolygonsComparison with Three Dimensional Shapes. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Setting —The play is set in the thirteenth or fourteenth century in Italy in Verona and Mantua. Much of the action takes place in Juliet's house. Two cities of Venice are also mentioned in the play. ... The play's basic setting, therefore, is rich and elegant.Theme — Love is naturally the play's dominant and most important theme. The play focuses on romantic love, specifically the intense passion that springs up at first sight between Romeo and Juliet. In Romeo and Juliet, love is a violent, ecstatic, overpowering force that supersedes all other values, loyalties, and emotions.Conflict — There are a few central conflicts in the play Romeo and Juliet. A major conflict throughout the whole play is the fighting between the Montagues and the Capulets. They are in a bitter feud, and everyone in Verona, Italy is affected by their hate for each other.<p></p>pakibrainliest <br />
