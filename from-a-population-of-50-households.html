                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions : (Citing Text Evidence)1. Title of the Text :2.

                                            WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.

Now, list down the problems which the children in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines are experiencing. The first one is provided for you as your guide.Reynold’s WorldExcerpt from Children in an Urban WorldReynold’s story is not new. It’s a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World’s Children 2012: Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services.Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila’s 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements.“Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse, and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society,” Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says.Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics, and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children’s health, education, and opportunities.Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children’s basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains.The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers – rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.B. From the problems emphasized in the article, choose one (1) and provide at least three (3) possible solutions to deal with the problem. W​</a>

                            6. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions : (Citing Text Evidence)1. Title of the Text :2.

                            8. WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.

                            17. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2. How would you solve the conflict?thank you &lt;33​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>NOTE: answers for number 1 and 2 are connected </p><p>I will have a serious talk with the government officials and let them realized how big and crucial the matter is. Since the report really have statistical figures, this means that it is a valid report that needs immediate action. The life of the children are at stake. In our country we can see the big gap between the rich and the poor children. We can see a lot of children in the street and sometime even asking for money in jeepneys. </p><p>It is better to start with a project that will answer the problem of poverty. Most of the families that belong to informal settlers came to the city to find for a better life opportunity. If we can provide them with jobs, a proper shelter and a clean water, maybe their lives will change. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It has been two years and this pandemic has not ended, we do not know when the exact day when this pandemic will end. But are there really ways to reduce the spread of the virus? There is, following the protocol implemented by the government. We should always do social distancing, wear a face mask and face shield when we go out of the house, wash our hands or use alcohol when we come out of the house. Because if we do not follow the protocols implemented by the government we can carry the virus inside the house and infect our family. Will the spread of the virus (covid 19) be reduced? No, because we did not follow the protocols implemented by the government. So always remember to always follow the protocols implemented by the government to reduce the spread of the virus. Always eat nutritious food and exercise so that we are not susceptible to the virus called covid 19. And most of all we always pray to god that this covid 19 disappears so that everything goes back to normal.</p><p></p><br />
