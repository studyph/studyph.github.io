                            13. As senior high school student, what can you contribute to lessen the social issues in your community?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What are three ways in which you can help address the social issues in the community?</p><p>If the latest vaccine discovery turns out to be a dud, what will happen to the stock market and the US economy?</p><p>It is my opinion that the Buy Side Institutions, which control the majority of listed and private equity stocks for mutual funds,</p><p>I am coming at this question in the frame of (A) that there is a community, or the potential of community, (B) that there is conflict in the community, and (C) that there is a desire for community intimacy.</p><p></p><p>And I think that the first task is the work of developing trust. This means personal work, maybe 1:1, maybe as a group, maybe as subgroups, to develop the trust that a person can say something, and that what the person says will be heard. That doesn’t mean agreed with, but it does mean that it will be heard, and met with a kind of care that doesn’t require agreement.</p><p></p><p>The second thing that I think is needed is that a space is created where the people in the community are invited to share their feelings, and can share their feelings. It doesn’t necessarily mean that people will feel “safe,” but it does mean that people will feel listened to, and cared about (which goes back to the trust piece.) It especially requires that the people feel that they can trust the facilitation, whomever it is.</p><p></p><p>The third thing that I think is needed is the willingness and capacity to receive and to deliver feedback. Feedback does not mean persecution, (“you deserve it!,”) nor does it mean rescuing (“oh poor you,” “you’re so brave,”) but rather, it is: “this is what I see and hear, this is what I notice,” that is both honest, and holding the speaker in care, and also allowing them to see what their piece is in the dynamic.</p><p></p><p>When people are committing to speaking the truth about themselves and about what they see and hear, to mutually supporting one another, and to participating responsibly, then I believe that the social issues can find what they need in the community.</p><br />

What was your experience in studying it? How effective was your study of the said subject?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>here hehe I hope my answer is worth it and helpful to you :)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions in Senior High School has been an enriching experience for me. Before taking the subject, I only had a superficial understanding of Philippine art, particularly on its historical and cultural significance. However, the subject has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation of the richness and diversity of Philippine art, particularly its contemporary expressions.</p><p></p><p>My experience in studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions has been positive overall. I was able to explore and discover various art forms and practices across different regions in the Philippines, and I learned about the different issues and concerns that artists in these regions tackle in their works. Moreover, the subject allowed me to appreciate the different contexts and experiences that shape the creation of art, and how art can reflect and respond to social, political, and cultural realities.</p><p></p><p>The subject was effective in teaching me about different art forms and techniques, and the different ways in which artists use them to convey meaning and evoke emotions. The lectures, discussions, and activities helped me understand the underlying concepts and theories that inform contemporary Philippine art, and how these concepts and theories are translated into actual artworks. Moreover, the subject provided me with opportunities to engage with artworks and to critically analyze them, which further deepened my understanding and appreciation of art.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also challenges in studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions. One of the challenges was the limited exposure to actual artworks, as most of the lectures and discussions were conducted online due to the pandemic. This made it difficult to fully appreciate and understand the artworks, as the online platform does not provide the same experience as viewing the artworks in person. Another challenge was the limited time to explore and discuss all the different art forms and practices across the different regions in the Philippines, which left me wanting to learn more.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, studying Contemporary Philippine Art from the Regions has been an enriching experience for me, and it has allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation of the richness and diversity of Philippine art. The subject was effective in teaching me about different art forms and techniques, and how these are used to convey meaning and evoke emotions. Despite the challenges, I am grateful for the opportunity to study this subject, and I look forward to continuing to explore and learn about Philippine art.</p><br />
