Place a heavy object such as a stone in the center of the cloth. This makes the center of the cloth bend downward. 3. Roll a marble so that it spirals around the stone. Observe what happened. 4. Change the speed and the initial angle of the marble as you roll the marble on the cloth. Record what you have observed. 5. Replace the heavy stone with a lighter stone in the center of the tablecloth and roll the morble again. Observe the movement of the object compored with the previous observations 6. Replace the marble with other round objects like table tennis ball small ball bearing and the ike. Observe the movement happened. 7. Record your observation on the table. Table 1.

                        <p>1. The marble began <strong>accelerating</strong>, but the angle did not change, and if you flick the marble, it becomes fast and the cloth has no effect on the marble.</p><p></p><p>2. After hitting with the hefty stone, the marble reflected in the other direction, left or right, not moving ahead and with a slight speed drop.</p><p></p><p>3. The marble had a bit of speed reduction on the hefty stone and reflected not making it travel forward but going left and right and the cloth didn't do much if the table is really long it might halt.</p><p></p><p>4. The smaller the thing, the faster it is; the heavier the object, the slower it is; and the more mass, the greater the gravity. The cloth has some friction, but the marble does not because it is smooth, thus it will not be affected as much.</p><p></p>Gravitation<p>According to the <strong>law of gravitation</strong>, everybody in the universe attracts every other body but the strength depends on the distance between .gravity is nothing but the form with which attracts any other body present on earth</p><p></p>What is gravity?<p>Gravity is a force pulling together all matter (which is anything you can physically touch). The more matter, the more gravity, so things that have a lot of matter such as planets and moons and stars pull more strongly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mass </strong>is how we measure the amount of matter in something. The more massive something is, the more of a gravitational pull it exerts. As we walk on the surface of the Earth, it pulls on us, and we pull back. But since the Earth is so much more massive than we are, the pull from us is not strong enough to move the Earth, while the pull from the Earth can make us fall flat on our faces.</p><p></p><p>In addition to depending on the amount of mass, gravity also depends on how far you are from something. This is why we are stuck to the surface of the Earth instead of being pulled off into the Sun, which has many more times the gravity of the Earth.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about gravitation here: https://brainly.ph/question/18502</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

                        <p>Introduction
</p><p>Have you ever dropped something and wondered how fast it was moving while falling? (If it was something fragile, you might not have been thinking about this at the time—you were likely too busy trying to grab the object!) We all know that gravity forces an object to fall. But how does this affect how quickly something falls and its impact? For example, did the object move faster right after leaving your hand, or just before hitting the ground? In this science activity, you will explore the relation between time and distance traveled when a moving object is under gravity's constant acceleration.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>heavy stone:1.heavy stone is really heavy right or not but heavy stones is slow hard to push not other like the light ones it stops quickly or doesn't go far 2.the heavy stone demolish the surroundings or take down the things going in front of it.<br /><br />light stone:1.very fast you can even flick it with your finger and it can go far like your position right now to the wall it will stop if it hits something 2.it might knock some if you flick it hard but it might just reflect not doing anything on the objects</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />
