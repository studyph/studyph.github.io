                                            Can anyone explain why I feel this way? I mean, whenever I feel like crying I would usually hold myself back, thinking that I don't deserve to shed a single tear while thinking of my past mistakes. I'd think that every bad thing that happens to me is my punishment. That I deserve it. I'm stuck in the self-critic phase. I've been there for a long time to the point that these negative thoughts don't faze me anymore. Is it even still possible to overcome this without a proper treatment?</a>

Traditional materials like printed books, chalk board, and flashcards are used in the classrooms before. On the other hand, technology like e-books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning.
