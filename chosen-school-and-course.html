Anton’s Indecisiveness Anton who took up the General Academic Strand in Senior High School has a hard time deciding what course to enroll in college. He graduated with honors and has received special citations. He is great in Science and Math but he is also into arts and graphic designing. He was told by his parents to decide for his course since colleges are already closing admission and the school opening is approaching fast. He is spending night analyzing his options. Sometimes he barely sleeps, over-analyzing all considerations. There are also pressures from his friends for him to join them in the university where there are wide variety of Science course he can choose from. He also considers the suggestions of his teachers who see his potential in graphic designing and multimedia arts. Anton really wants to enroll in the most prestigious school to study the course that perfectly fits him. After thorough self-deliberation, he comes down to two schools and four courses. But this does not end his considerations; he still has more factors to visit. His family and friends are starting to worry if he could ever make a final decision. It has finally come one day when everything was in place. Anton finally decides to enroll! He hurries to the school of his choice, but he’s an hour late! The enrolment has just closed for his first choice. To add in more to his regrets, his second chosen program has also reached the maximum number of students and it was closed days ago. Sad and full of regrets, Anton goes home thinking of the lost time overthinking his options. And that is because he can just not make up his mind. Processing Questions: Write your answers on a sheet of paper. 1. Did you experience spending more time to make a decision that greatly affects you or your future just like Anton? Share your experience. 2. If you are in his situation, what would be your next move? 3. What should you do so you won’t face the same problem as that of Anton? ​</a>

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2. Why did Megan Reyes choose Silliman University?3. What's her purpose for applying? 4. What other documents are sent together with her letter?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Use of daily or weekly allowances: Economics can help you make better decisions with your daily or weekly allowances by understanding the concept of opportunity cost. Opportunity cost refers to the cost of the next best alternative forgone when making a decision. For example, if you have a daily allowance of $10 and you want to buy a coffee that costs $5, you need to consider what else you could do with that $5, such as saving it or spending it on something else you need. By considering opportunity cost, you can make better decisions that align with your priorities and goals.</p><p></p><p>Time Management: Time is a scarce resource, and economics can help you manage it effectively. One way to do this is by using the concept of marginal analysis, which involves weighing the costs and benefits of each additional hour you spend on a particular task. For example, if you are studying for an exam, you need to decide whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes or taking a break to relax. By considering the marginal costs and benefits of each option, you can make a more informed decision about how to allocate your time.</p><p></p><p>Chosen School and course: Economics can also help you make better decisions about your education, such as choosing a school and course of study. By considering the costs and benefits of each option, you can make a decision that aligns with your goals and preferences. For example, if you are deciding between two schools, you need to consider the tuition costs, the quality of education, and the potential return on investment in terms of future job prospects. By weighing these factors, you can make a more informed decision about which school to attend and what course to study.</p><br />

Anton’s Indecisiveness Anton who took up the General Academic Strand in Senior High School has a hard time deciding what course to enroll in college. He graduated with honors and has received special citations. He is great in Science and Math but he is also into arts and graphic designing. He was told by his parents to decide for his course since colleges are already closing admission and the school opening is approaching fast. He is spending night analyzing his options. Sometimes he barely sleeps, over-analyzing all considerations. There are also pressures from his friends for him to join them in the university where there are wide variety of Science course he can choose from. He also considers the suggestions of his teachers who see his potential in graphic designing and multimedia arts. Anton really wants to enroll in the most prestigious school to study the course that perfectly fits him. After thorough self-deliberation, he comes down to two schools and four courses. But this does not end his considerations; he still has more factors to visit. His family and friends are starting to worry if he could ever make a final decision. It has finally come one day when everything was in place. Anton finally decides to enroll! He hurries to the school of his choice, but he’s an hour late! The enrolment has just closed for his first choice. To add in more to his regrets, his second chosen program has also reached the maximum number of students and it was closed days ago. Sad and full of regrets, Anton goes home thinking of the lost time overthinking his options. And that is because he can just not make up his mind. Processing Questions: Write your answers on a sheet of paper. 1. Did you experience spending more time to make a decision that greatly affects you or your future just like Anton?
