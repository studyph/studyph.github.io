                                            Given the following business scenario, create a Crow’s Foot ERD using a specialization hierarchy if appropriate.
A research think tank is developing a simple database to keep track of projects and researchers assigned to projects. The organization has several departments that employ researchers and administrative assistants. Employees are assigned to (employed by) departments. An employee can be employed by only one department. Within a single department there is a limit on the maximum number of employees assigned to it and it is 40. That is, a department can employ no more than 40 employees. For each employee the organization keeps the employee number, name, office, phone, job classification, date the employee was hired, and salary.
Each project has a budget and a team of employees/researchers working on the project. To make the projects manageable there is a limit of the number of researchers assigned to a single project. Each project has no more than 10 researchers assigned to it. Further, each project has at least 3 researchers. To ensure productivity, a researcher cannot be assigned to more than 3 projects at any time. New employees that are researchers are not assigned to any project for the first few months. It is important to keep the number of hours a researcher spent on each project since this information is used for billing purposes.
Each department and project have a manager who gets a bonus for managing department/project. There is only one manager of each of these organizational units. Obviously not every employee can be a manager. For most of the employees managing project or department is not mandatory.
The organization wants to keep the information on researchers, managers, and administrative assistants in separate tables. The information on researchers includes main specialty and highest degree. For the administrative assistants, the organization stores the typing speed. For the managers, the organization stores bonus.

                            2. Discuss the importance of a Human Resource Department in an Organization.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Human resources is important to organizations in myriad areas, ranging from strategic planning to company image. HR practitioners in a small business who have well-rounded expertise provide a number of services to employees. The areas in which HR maintains control can enhance an employees’ experience throughout the workforce while strengthening business operations.</p><p>1. Strategic Management</p><p>HR improves the company's bottom line with its knowledge of how human capital affects organizational success. Leaders with expertise in HR strategic management participate in corporate decision-making that underlies current staffing assessments and projections for future workforce needs based on business demand.</p><p></p><p>2. Wages and Salaries</p><p>HR compensation specialists develop realistic compensation structures that set company wages competitive with other businesses in the area, in the same industry or companies competing for employees with similar skills. They conduct extensive wage and salary surveys to maintain compensation costs in line with the organization's current financial status and projected revenue.</p><p></p><p>3. Analyzing Benefits</p><p>Benefits specialists can reduce the company’s costs associated with turnover, attrition and hiring replacement workers. They are important to the organization because they have the skills and expertise necessary to negotiate group benefit packages for employees, within the organization's budget and consistent with economic conditions. They also are familiar with employee benefits most likely to attract and retain workers. This can reduce the company’s costs associated with turnover, attrition and hiring replacement workers.</p><p></p><p>4. Safety and Risk Management</p><p>Employers have an obligation to provide safe working conditions. Workplace safety and risk management specialists from the HR area manage compliance with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations through maintaining accurate work logs and records, and developing programs that reduce the number of workplace injuries and fatalities. Workplace safety specialists also engage employees in promoting awareness and safe handling of dangerous equipment and hazardous chemicals.</p><p></p><p>5. Minimizing Liability Issues</p><p>HR employee relations specialists minimize the organization's exposure and liability related to allegations of unfair employment practices. They identify, investigate and resolve workplace issues that, left unattended, could spiral out of control and embroil the organization in legal matters pertaining to federal and state anti-discrimination and harassment laws.</p><p></p><p>6. Training and Development</p><p>HR training and development specialists coordinate new employee orientation, an essential step in forging a strong employer-employee relationship. The training and development area of HR also provides training that supports the company's fair employment practices and employee development to prepare aspiring leaders for supervisory and management roles.</p><p></p><p>7. Employee Satisfaction</p><p>Employee relations specialists in HR help the organization achieve high performance, morale and satisfaction levels throughout the workforce, by creating ways to strengthen the employer-employee relationship. They administer employee opinion surveys, conduct focus groups and seek employee input regarding job satisfaction and ways the employer can sustain good working relationships.</p><p></p><p>8. Recruitment and Onboarding</p><p>HR recruiters manage the employment process from screening resumes to scheduling interviews to processing new employees. Typically, they determine the most effective methods for recruiting applicants, including assessing which applicant tracking systems are best suited for the organization's needs.</p><p></p><p>9. Hiring Processes</p><p>HR professionals work closely with hiring managers to effect good hiring decisions, according to the organization's workforce needs. They provide guidance to managers who aren't familiar with HR or standard hiring processes to ensure that the company extends offers to suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>10. Maintaining Compliance</p><p>HR workers ensure that the organization complies with federal state employment laws. They complete paperwork necessary for documenting that the company's employees are eligible to work in the U.S. They also monitor compliance with applicable laws for organizations that receive federal or state government contracts, through maintaining applicant flow logs, written affirmative action plans and disparate impact analyses.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>D ko po alam kung ito po na sagot yung hinahanp nyo, :) </p><br />

                            26. Given the following business scenario, create a Crow’s Foot ERD using a specialization hierarchy if appropriate.
A research think tank is developing a simple database to keep track of projects and researchers assigned to projects. The organization has several departments that employ researchers and administrative assistants. Employees are assigned to (employed by) departments. An employee can be employed by only one department. Within a single department there is a limit on the maximum number of employees assigned to it and it is 40. That is, a department can employ no more than 40 employees. For each employee the organization keeps the employee number, name, office, phone, job classification, date the employee was hired, and salary.
Each project has a budget and a team of employees/researchers working on the project. To make the projects manageable there is a limit of the number of researchers assigned to a single project. Each project has no more than 10 researchers assigned to it. Further, each project has at least 3 researchers. To ensure productivity, a researcher cannot be assigned to more than 3 projects at any time. New employees that are researchers are not assigned to any project for the first few months. It is important to keep the number of hours a researcher spent on each project since this information is used for billing purposes.
Each department and project have a manager who gets a bonus for managing department/project. There is only one manager of each of these organizational units. Obviously not every employee can be a manager. For most of the employees managing project or department is not mandatory.
The organization wants to keep the information on researchers, managers, and administrative assistants in separate tables. The information on researchers includes main specialty and highest degree.

                        <strong>CROW'S FOOT ERD USING SPECIALIZATION HIERARCHY</strong><p>Crow's Foot <strong>ERD</strong> (Entity-Relationship Diagram) is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other in a database. It is a popular and widely used tool for data modeling, which helps to visualize and organize the various entities, attributes, and relationships in a database system. In a Crow's Foot <strong>ERD</strong>, the entities are represented as rectangles, and the relationships between entities are represented as lines connecting the rectangles. The lines are annotated with symbols to indicate the type of relationship between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships. The Crow's Foot notation is named after the crow's foot symbol that represents a one-to-many relationship.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>Sample Crow's foot ERD<strong> </strong><p>      +--------------+                        +--------------+</p><p>      |  Department  |                |    Project   |</p><p>      +--------------+                +--------------+</p><p>      |  Dept_ID (PK)|                | Project_ID (PK) |</p><p>      |  Name        |                | Title          |</p><p>      |  Max_Emps    |                | Budget         |</p><p>      |  Manager_ID (FK) ----------&lt;&gt;|  Manager_ID (FK)|</p><p>      +--------------+                +--------------+</p><p>                             |</p><p>                             |</p><p>                    +------+------+</p><p>                      |             |</p><p>      +--------------+    +-------------------+</p><p>      | Researcher   |    | Administrative     |</p><p>      +--------------+    |       Assistant          |</p><p>      | Researcher_ID|    +-------------------+</p><p>      | Name         |    | Assistant_ID (PK)  |</p><p>      | Office       |    | Name              |</p><p>      | Phone        |    | Typing_Speed      |</p><p>      | Job_Class    |    +-------------------+</p><p>      | Hire_Date    |</p><p>      | Salary       |</p><p>      | Specialty    |</p><p>      | Highest_Degree|</p><p>      +--------------+</p><p></p><p>      +--------+</p><p>      |  Manages|</p><p>      +--------+</p><p>      |  Manager_ID (PK) (FK) |</p><p>      |  Department_ID (FK) |</p><p>      |  Project_ID (FK)    |</p><p>      |  Bonus              |</p><p>      +---------------------+</p><p> </p><p>      +------------+</p><p>      |  Works_On  |</p><p>      +------------+</p><p>      |  Project_ID (PK) (FK)|</p><p>      |  Researcher_ID (PK) (FK)|</p><p>      |  Hours_Spent          |</p><p>      +----------------------+</p><p>In this updated ERD, we have added three new entities: Researcher, Administrative Assistant, and Manages.</p><p></p><p>Researcher has attributes Researcher_ID, Name, Office, Phone, Job_Class, Hire_Date, Salary, Specialty, and Highest_Degree, where Researcher_ID is the primary key of the table.</p><p></p><p>Administrative Assistant has attributes Assistant_ID, Name, and Typing_Speed, where Assistant_ID is the primary key of the table.</p><p></p><p>Manages has attributes Manager_ID, Department_ID, Project_ID, and Bonus, where Manager_ID is the primary key and also a foreign key referencing Researcher.Researcher_ID.
