                                            With the average hours of TV viewing reaching an alarming eight hours a day or more, it is obvious that the general population has abandoned reading as a leisure activity. To counter this undesirable trend, it is important to understand why reading interest has waned and what the results are. Some name the advent of technology - Internet, iPads, ipods, film, TV, video games, cell phones, and radio - as one cause of the decline in reading. Aside from the old-time high of public involvement with technology, there is a deemphasis on reading and reading skills in the public school system. Reading has become a less valuable activity; thus, interest in it and the ability to read fall. Another factor is the rapid pace of life today. As a consequence, people depend on quick information from seventh-grade level news stories rather than from insightful and complete descriptions of events in books and periodicals. People, too, no longer read at the levels they once did. Altogether, the effects of the decline in reading appear critical. People are grossly misinformed of issues and histories. Because of this situation, they tend to lose the ability to think to actively participate in intellectual and mental processes that require agile minds. Without the ability to think clearly, the capacity to make decisions and solve problems is likely to be impaired. Ultimately, thinking tasks for a safe and healthy future may be waylaid. Yet, reading for advancement, as well as for entertainment, is critical if the world is to successfully meet the challenges of tomorrow. 1. What are the possible causes of the decline in reading? 2. What are the possible effects of such decline? 3. Do these causes and effects affect you? Explain. 4. What do you think can schools and any other institutions do to solve this problem? As a senior high school student, what do you do to improve your reading habit? 5. What is the topic sentence? 6. What is the subject?​</a>

                            6. With the average hours of TV viewing reaching an alarming eight hours a day or more, it is obvious that the general population has abandoned reading as a leisure activity. To counter this undesirable trend, it is important to understand why reading interest has waned and what the results are. Some name the advent of technology - Internet, iPads, ipods, film, TV, video games, cell phones, and radio - as one cause of the decline in reading. Aside from the old-time high of public involvement with technology, there is a deemphasis on reading and reading skills in the public school system. Reading has become a less valuable activity; thus, interest in it and the ability to read fall. Another factor is the rapid pace of life today. As a consequence, people depend on quick information from seventh-grade level news stories rather than from insightful and complete descriptions of events in books and periodicals. People, too, no longer read at the levels they once did. Altogether, the effects of the decline in reading appear critical. People are grossly misinformed of issues and histories. Because of this situation, they tend to lose the ability to think to actively participate in intellectual and mental processes that require agile minds. Without the ability to think clearly, the capacity to make decisions and solve problems is likely to be impaired. Ultimately, thinking tasks for a safe and healthy future may be waylaid. Yet, reading for advancement, as well as for entertainment, is critical if the world is to successfully meet the challenges of tomorrow. 1. What are the possible causes of the decline in reading? 2. What are the possible effects of such decline? 3. Do these causes and effects affect you? Explain. 4. What do you think can schools and any other institutions do to solve this problem? As a senior high school student, what do you do to improve your reading habit? 5. What is the topic sentence? 6. What is the subject?​</h2><br />
