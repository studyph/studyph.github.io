Read the following questions and write the letter of your answer in your Science activity notebook. Questions 6-10, refer to the situation below. Sarah wanted to find out if temperature has an effect on the growth of bread mold. She grew the mold in nine Petri dishes containing the same amount and type of nutrients. Three were kept at 0 °C, while three were stored at 90 °C, and another three were kept at room temperature of 27 °C. The containers were examined and the growth of the bread mold was recorded each Friday for five weeks 12​</a>

Mixed method approach is used for the researches that require both numerical and textual data. 3. The research questions determine the appropriate approach for the study. 4. The research design is described in the methodology section of the research paper. 5. Correlational research design explores how characteristics may change over time within a study group. 6. True experimental research design involves an experimental setup with limited control and a nonrandom selection of study participants. 7. Causal comparative research may involve multiple factors as independent variable. 8. Case study is an in-depth exploration of a program, an event, an activity, a process, or one or more individuals. 9. Phenomenological study aims to develop a theory that is grounded in the views of participants in the study. 10. Concurrent Nested is a research design that embeds the data collection phase of one approach within the other. 11. Sample refers to any complete group sharing a common set of characteristics. 12. Probability sampling is based on researcher’s choice such as accessibility and availability. 13. Sampling design refers to the technique or procedure used by the researcher for selecting items as samples from the population. 14. Simple random sampling determines the sample by giving equal chance for every member of the population to be selected. 15. Stratified random sampling divides the population into mutually exclusive groups and random samples are drawn from each group. 16. Purposive sampling may be used when a researcher wishes to include only people who meet specific criteria. 17. Snowball sampling is a strategy which is useful when a researcher wishes to study some stigmatized group or behavior. 18. Snowball sampling is also referred to as haphazard sampling. 19. Quota sampling creates subgroups that are created based on each category and the researcher decides how many people to include from each subgroup. 20. Convenience sampling is most useful in explanatory research. 21. Data refers to a collection of facts such as values and measurements. 22. Constant refers to a characteristic, number, or quantity that increases or decreases over time or takes different values in different situations. 23.

                            22. Write True if the given statement is correct and False if otherwise. 1. Qualitative approach is used when the research questions require numerical data. 2. Mixed method approach is used for the researches that require both numerical and textual data. 3. The research questions determine the appropriate approach for the study. 4. The research design is described in the methodology section of the research paper. 5. Correlational research design explores how characteristics may change over time within a study group. 6. True experimental research design involves an experimental setup with limited control and a nonrandom selection of study participants. 7. Causal comparative research may involve multiple factors as independent variable. 8. Case study is an in-depth exploration of a program, an event, an activity, a process, or one or more individuals. 9. Phenomenological study aims to develop a theory that is grounded in the views of participants in the study. 10. Concurrent Nested is a research design that embeds the data collection phase of one approach within the other. 11. Sample refers to any complete group sharing a common set of characteristics. 12. Probability sampling is based on researcher’s choice such as accessibility and availability. 13. Sampling design refers to the technique or procedure used by the researcher for selecting items as samples from the population. 14. Simple random sampling determines the sample by giving equal chance for every member of the population to be selected. 15. Stratified random sampling divides the population into mutually exclusive groups and random samples are drawn from each group. 16. Purposive sampling may be used when a researcher wishes to include only people who meet specific criteria. 17. Snowball sampling is a strategy which is useful when a researcher wishes to study some stigmatized group or behavior. 18. Snowball sampling is also referred to as haphazard sampling. 19. Quota sampling creates subgroups that are created based on each category and the researcher decides how many people to include from each subgroup. 20. Convenience sampling is most useful in explanatory research. 21. Data refers to a collection of facts such as values and measurements. 22. Constant refers to a characteristic, number, or quantity that increases or decreases over time or takes different values in different situations. 23. Moderating variable may affect the cause-and-effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables.pahelp ​</h2><br />
