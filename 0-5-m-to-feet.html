Birds are vertebrates that are warm blooded. Their
bodies keep the same temperature even when the
temperature of the air changes. Their bodies are
spindle-shaped and are covered with feathers. They
have wings, hollow bones and thin skulls. These make
their bodies extremely light that are excellent for flying.
The bird's mouth is in the form of a hom called beak.
The beak and feet of birds show adaptation to different
ways of life. For example, their beak is used for picking
seeds and catching fish, while their feet are used for
walking and perching on the trunk of trees. They
breathe through their lungs and they lay eggs with shell

Birds are vertebrates that are warm blooded. Their
bodies keep the same temperature even when the
temperature of the air changes. Their bodies are
spindle-shaped and are covered with feathers. They
have wings, hollow bones and thin skulls. These make
their bodies extremely light that are excellent for flying.
The bird's mouth is in the form of a hom called beak.
The beak and feet of birds show adaptation to different
ways of life. For example, their beak is used for picking
seeds and catching fish, while their feet are used for
walking and perching on the trunk of trees. They
breathe through their lungs and they lay eggs with shell
