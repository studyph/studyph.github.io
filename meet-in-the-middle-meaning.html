You held a meeting with four of your middle managers (2 department head, 1 director, and 1 chief supervisor) with the agenda of opening a new franchise. You asked them whether they are in favor of building it somewhere in Siquijor even if it's far. Each voter's response is recorded as 'Yes (Y)' or 'No(N)'. If we let X be the random variable for those who voted yes, construct the probability distribution of the random variable X. (Note: Make a table to show your steps and solution) 2.) Jack got 94 for his quarter 3 Statistics and Probability grade and his grade is at 91st percentile. This only means that 91% of his classmates scored lower than what he got. This explains that 91st percentile is located at a point such that 91% of the total population lies below that point and 9% lies above. Identify the corresponding z-value of the given area using the z-table found in module 2. (Note: Make a table to show your steps and solution)​</a>

You held a meeting with four of your middle managers (2 department head, 1 director, and 1 chief supervisor) with the agenda of opening a new franchise. You asked them whether they are in favor of building it somewhere in Siquijor even if it's far. Each voter's response is recorded as 'Yes (Y)' or 'No(N)'. If we let X be the random variable for those who voted yes, construct the probability distribution of the random variable X. (Note: Make a table to show your steps and solution) 2.) Jack got 94 for his quarter 3 Statistics and Probability grade and his grade is at 91st percentile. This only means that 91% of his classmates scored lower than what he got. This explains that 91st percentile is located at a point such that 91% of the total population lies below that point and 9% lies above. Identify the corresponding z-value of the given area using the z-table found in module 2. (Note: Make a table to show your steps and solution)​</h2><br />
