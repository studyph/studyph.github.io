Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

Hermeneutic Analysis</p><p></p><p></p>About phenomenology<p> <strong>Phenomenology</strong> is a study in terms of philosophy that studies human as a phenomenon.  The <strong>science</strong> of phenomonology in philosophy is usually associated with the science of hermeneutics, namely the science that studies the benefits of this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p> This term was first introduced by <strong>Johann Heinrich Lambert</strong> (1728 - 1777), a German philosopher.  In his book Neues Organon (1764).  he wrote about unreal knowledge.</p><p></p><p> In the literary approach, <strong>phenomenology</strong> uses the intuitive experience of phenomena, something that has a phenomenological reflection, as a starting point and effort to get to the nature of experience and the nature of what we experience.  G.W.F.  Hegel and Edmund Husserl are two important figures in the development of this philosophical approach.</p><p></p><p> The <strong>phenomenological tradition</strong> concentrates on personal experience including the realm of individuals who actually share experiences with one another.  Communication is seen as a round of sharing experiences or information between individuals through discussion.  Good relations between individuals have a high position in this tradition.  In this tradition, it is said that language represents a meaning for objects.  So, just one word can give meaning to something that will be interpreted.</p><p></p><p> Fundamentally, phenomenology is a tradition of study used to explore human experience.  As stated by Littlejohn that phenomenology is a tradition to explore human experience.  In this <strong>context</strong>, the assumption is correct that humans actively understand the world around them as a life experience and actively interpret that experience.</p><p> The main <strong>assumption</strong> of phenomenology is that humans actively interpret their experiences by providing a formula for something they experience.  Therefore interpretation is an active process to provide a formula for something that is experienced by humans.  In other words understanding is a creative action, namely action towards meaning.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>phenomenology</strong> at https://brainly.ph/question/987790.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />
