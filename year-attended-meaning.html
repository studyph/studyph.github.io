One of the most annoying experiences for teachers like me is when students are absent. We prepare lesson plans with the objective that 100% of the class willhi learn from the day’s classroom activities, and it is most satisfying when all students are present on that day and the days thereafter to ensure maximum learning. Sadly, it is very difficult to achieve perfect attendance. No matter how interesting and well-prepared the lessons and teaching materials are, there are bound to be students who miss out on the day’s activities—willingly or unwillingly (Murcia 2015).​</a>

                                            Case on Education and Training    The President/COO of a small manufacturing firm of about 300 employees had learned over the years the value of education and training. Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</a>

                            9. Case on Education and Training    The President/COO of a small manufacturing firm of about 300 employees had learned over the years the value of education and training. Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a whole…., It's not easy to introduce TQM. An open, cooperative culture has to be created by management. Employees have to be made to feel that they are responsible for customer satisfaction. They are not going to feel this if they are excluded from the development of visions, strategies, and plans. It's important they participate in these activities. They are unlikely to behave in a responsible way if they see management behaving irresponsibly - saying one thing and doing the opposite.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT'S HELP PA BRAINLIEST TY</p><p>SOURCE; G0OGLE</p><p></p><p></p><br />

He is a model employee who never had attendance issues and delivered all the required work targets close to above average performance. However, the competition is so cut throat, that the management team thinks that the balance within the company must be disturbed in order to survive in next 3 years of business life.

And John is your close friend. What will you do? Elaborate.​</h2><br />
