Design thinking is a method to focus the design and development decisions of a product on the needs of the customer, typically involving an empathy-driven process to define complex problems and create solutions that address those problems. Complexity is key to design thinking. Straightforward problems that can be solved with enough money and force do not require much design thinking. Creative design thinking and planning are about finding new solutions for problems with several tricky variables in play. Designing products for human beings, who are complex and sometimes unpredictable, requires design thinking.</p><p></p><p>Airbnb has become a widely used service all over the world. That has not always been the case, however. In 2009, the company was near failure. The founders were struggling to find a reason for the lack of interest in their properties until they realized that their listings needed professional, high-quality photographs rather than simple cell-phone photos. Using a design thinking approach, the founders traveled to the properties with a rented camera to take some new photographs. As a result of this experiment, weekly revenue doubled. This approach could not be sustainable in the long term, but it generated the outcome the founders needed to better understand the problem. This creative approach to solving a complex problem proved to be a major turning point for the company.7</p><p></p><p>People who are adept at design thinking are creative, innovative, and inventive as they strive to tackle different types of problems. Consider Divya Nag, a millennial biotech and medical device innovation leader, who launched a business after she discovered a creative way to prolong the life of human cells in Petri dishes. Nag’s stem-cell research background and her entrepreneurial experience with her medical investment firm made her a popular choice when Apple hired her to run two programs dedicated to developing health-related apps, a position she reached before turning twenty-four years old.8</p><p></p><p>Creativity, innovation, inventiveness, and entrepreneurship can be tightly linked. It is possible for one person to model all these traits to some degree. Additionally, you can develop your creativity skills, sense of innovation, and inventiveness in a variety of ways. In this section, we’ll discuss each of the key terms and how they relate to the entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Creativity</p><p>Entrepreneurial creativity and artistic creativity are not so different. You can find inspiration in your favorite books, songs, and paintings, and you also can take inspiration from existing products and services. You can find creative inspiration in nature, in conversations with other creative minds, and through formal ideation exercises, for example, brainstorming. Ideation is the purposeful process of opening up your mind to new trains of thought that branch out in all directions from a stated purpose or problem. Brainstorming, the generation of ideas in an environment free of judgment or dissension with the goal of creating solutions, is just one of dozens of methods for coming up with new ideas.9</p><p></p><p>You can benefit from setting aside time for ideation. Reserving time to let your mind roam freely as you think about an issue or problem from multiple directions is a necessary component of the process. Ideation takes time and a deliberate effort to move beyond your habitual thought patterns. If you consciously set aside time for creativity, you will broaden your mental horizons and allow yourself to change and grow.10</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer &amp; Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p><p>Climate change is a growing concern around the world, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that collective action is needed to address this issue. One way to do this is through community service, which can bring together individuals to work towards a common goal. In this article, we will explore how students can take the lead in community service by using reminders to promote environmentally friendly practices.</p><p></p><p><strong>Background</strong>:</p><p>Climate change is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide emissions from human activities. This has led to rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and more frequent extreme weather events. The consequences of climate change are already being felt around the world, from droughts and food shortages to flooding and displacement.</p><p></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p><p>Students can play a crucial role in addressing climate change by promoting environmentally friendly practices within their communities. By using reminders, such as posters and social media campaigns, students can encourage others to adopt behaviors that reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment.</p><p></p><p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p><p>The objectives of this initiative are to:</p><p></p>Raise awareness about the impact of climate change and the importance of taking action.Encourage individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices in their daily lives.Mobilize students to take the lead in community service projects that promote sustainability.<p><strong>Execution</strong>:</p><p>To achieve these objectives, students can use a variety of strategies, such as:</p><p></p>Creating posters and flyers that promote environmentally friendly practices, such as reducing energy use, conserving water, and recycling.Launching social media campaigns that spread awareness about climate change and encourage others to take action.Organizing community service projects, such as beach cleanups or tree-planting events, that promote sustainability and bring people together.Collaborating with local businesses and organizations to promote sustainable practices and reduce carbon emissions.<p>By using reminders and other strategies, students can help to create a culture of environmental stewardship within their communities. This, in turn, can lead to more sustainable practices and a healthier planet for future generations.<br /><br /><strong>PA BRAINLIEST</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>       Effectiveness, financial security, equity, and responsiveness are all important goals of health systems and, by extension, health services. Evidence from high-income countries suggests that school health services have the potential to perform well across a range of health-system objectives.</p><p> </p><p>        School health services are available to families and are available where the majority of adolescents are. They overcome obstacles such as transportation, inconvenient locations, and appointment systems. They have the ability to influence multiple health determinants, such as public health interventions and environmental change strategies.</p><p>        There is some evidence, mostly from high-income countries, that school health services are effective, particularly for sexual and reproductive health, obesity and physical activity improvements, self-care among youth with chronic health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, smoking cessation, and the prevention and management of infectious disease among adolescents through immunizations.</p><p></p><p>       They are completely free at the point of use. Services appear to have cost benefits in terms of adolescent health and society as a whole by reducing health disparities and secondary care facility attendance.   They are highly valued by students, parents, and communities, and they can serve as conduits between schools and communities</p><p>    </p><p>       School health services manage CHCs in a safe and effective manner, often for students who have limited access to health care. Students with CHCs who have direct access to school nursing and other health services, as well as disease-specific education, have better health and academic outcomes. Students perform better in school when they are emotionally and physically healthy, according to research. They miss fewer classes, are less likely to engage in risky or antisocial behavior, concentrate better, and perform better on tests.</p><p>        </p><p>( pa brainliest po )</p><br />
