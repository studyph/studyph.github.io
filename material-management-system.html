                                            The manager of a tool and die shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.

Kotobee is a universal software for creating and publishing e-books for writers, novelists, authors, etc. It is one of the most comprehensive solutions for creating interactive e-books due to its advanced features and functionality.</strong> It is actually a suite of technologies that provide interactive e-book creators and solutions to suit the needs of any individual or organization. <strong>Kotobee Author, Kotobee Publisher, Kotobee Cloud, and Kotobee</strong> Reader are the four main products offered. Author is a platform that allows you to create interactive e-books using advanced e-book editors and editors. You can export your work to website, desktop, and mobile as well.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is DepEd Learning Management System</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Department of Education (DepEd) Learning Management System (LMS) </strong>is a software application or web-based technology used to plan, implement, and assess a specific learning process. <strong>The function</strong> of a learning management system is that it provides a way for instructors to create and deliver content, monitor student participation, and assess student performance. Learning management systems also serve to give students the ability to use interactive features such as threaded discussions, video conferencing, and discussion forums.</p><p></p><p><strong>Portable Document Format</strong><strong> </strong>or what we are more familiar with is the PDF format. So this PDF format is a product from Adobe for acrobat products. Indeed, from Adobe, PDF is used as one of the document exchanges that can be applied and distributed online. It is indirectly a format used for document exchange. Software support for this format covers all computer platforms and handheld devices such as smartphones, tablets and more. </p><p><strong>The advantages of PDF</strong>, and this is also the reason why PDF is so familiar to use, including:</p><p><strong>1. PDF Format is Flexible to Use</strong></p><p>As explained in the previous definition of PDF, where portable refers to a flexible digital product that allows this format to be opened on any device such as a computer or smartphone. Even though this format is opened on devices with different versions, it will not change the contents of the file. The contents of a PDF-extension file are fixed and will not change without the help of other software to change the contents of the text in it. This is the advantage of PDF over Microsoft Word, which tends to change the composition of the contents if opened on a different version of Microsoft.</p><p><strong>2. PDF Has a Lock Feature</strong></p><p>Adobe System developed a lock feature on PDF. So if you want to keep the document secret, make the document cannot be copied or want the document to be seen by others, you can use the lock feature to give a password to your PDF document.</p><p><strong>3. Editable PDF</strong></p><p>Worried that documents that have already been converted to PDF cannot be edited again? Or is there a chaotic arrangement of text? Don't worry, because you can edit the contents of PDF files with the help of PDF reader software.</p><p><strong>4. PDF Can Store Images</strong></p><p>Not only text files, in the PDF format you can also store data in the form of images, photos or graphics. In addition, converting files to PDF format can reduce the size of the file.</p><p><strong>5. Compatible with Various Computers</strong></p><p>Unlike the doc and other formats that can only be opened on computers with Microsoft Office software installed. The PDF format is compatible with various computer operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac-OS and others.</p><p>Because PDF is now accepted and widely used by the public, you can easily get the software because it is not only Adobe Reader.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here's some links that might help you</p><p>brainly.ph/question/2059851</p><p>brainly.ph/question/11099804</p><p>brainly.ph/question/10616935</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ6</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            22. The manager of a tool and die shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and disposal is one of the major problems of urban environment in most countries worldwide today.

The conventional landfill, incineration, composting, and ways of handeling solid wastes are common as mature technologies for waste disposal. Traditionally, the most commonly used technologies for the treatment and valorization of the organic fraction of MSW are composting and anaerobic digestion (AD). The generation of organic solid waste (OSW); worldwide; is dramatically increasing each year. Most of the OSW’s are composed of agricultural waste, household food waste, human and animal wastes, etc. They are normally handled as animal feed, incinerated or disposed to landfill sites.
