                                            17. Heat deep in the core of the Earth continually escapes toward the surface. As the heat rises, it warm rock, which begin to rise slowly. This molten rock or magma, usually cools within. Sometimes, however, magma continues to push upward. It absorbs water in the ground and heats it to produce steam or gas. Gas- filled magma is lighter and can rise through a series of channels toward the surface When it reaches a vent or opening in the surface it spews out. Magma that erupts from a vent is called lava, reaching temperature of more than 1000 degrees centigrade When cooled the lava and other materials, such as ash and rocks, build up to form the cone of a volcano. 18. Whole year-round typhoons occur. It is always good to prepare for the coming of any typhoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if necessary, repair or fixing is needed. With this, cleaning up the house drainage system is a must to avoid clogging up. Next, store an adequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Everything in the should be put in an elevated position, especially those items that generate electricity. Water should not penetrate into them in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries, and first aid supplies 19. Moist air and heat are necessary for hurricanes to start and to keep on going. As the surface of the ocean heats up the water goes up into the air. This warm air becomes moist. It starts to form a column. The air around rushes toward the column and forms a spiral around it. The system is called cyclone. As the column of air becomes warmer, the winds blow faster. If the storm reaches 119 kph, a hurricane is born. Hurricanes often cover areas up to 300 kilometers wide. They may last a few hours or for two weeks. They cause heavy rains that swell and overflow rivers. The strong winds produce floods. 20. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a "greenhouse effect".​</a>

lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny
tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they
grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like
a frog but it has a tail. This is called a froglet. Finally, the froglet loose its tail. Now, it's

                                            Directions: Read the following short texts and distinguish whether it is SEQUENTIAL, CAUSAL, orCONSEQUENTIAL.______16.A tsunami is a series of large waves generated by an abrupt movement on the oceanfloor that can result from an earthquake, an underwater landslide, a volcanic eruption or - veryrarely - a large meteorite strike. However, powerful undersea earthquakes are responsible for mosttsunamis.____17. Heat deep in the core of the Earth continually escapes toward the surface. As the heatrises, it warm rock, which begin to rise slowly. This molten rock, or magma, usually cools within.Sometimes, however, magma continues to push upward. It absorbs water in the ground and heats itto produce steam or gas. Gas-filled magma is lighter and can rise through a series of channelstoward the surface. When it reaches a vent or opening in the surface it spews out. Magma thaterupts from a vent is called lava, reaching temperature of more than 1000 degrees centigrade. Whencooled the lava and other materials, such as ash and rocks, build up to form the cone of a volcano.____18. Whole-year round typhoons occur. It is always good to prepare for the coming of anytyphoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if necessary repair or fixing is needed.With this, cleaning up the house drainage system is a must to avoid clogging up. Next, store anadequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Everything in the should be put in anelevated position, especially those items that generate electricity. Water should not penetrate intothem in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries,and first aid supplies.____19.. Moist air and heat are necessary for hurricanes to start and to keep on going. As thesurface of the ocean heats up, the water goes up into the air. This warm air becomes moist. It startsto form a column. The air around rushes toward the column and forms a spiral around it. The systemis called cyclone. As the column of air becomes warmer, the winds blow faster. If the storm reaches119 kph, a hurricane is born. Hurricanes often cover areas up to 300 kilometers wide. They may lasta few hours or for two weeks. They cause heavy rains that swell and overflow rivers. The strongwinds produce floods.____20. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convertland from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It iscalled a greenhouse gas because it produces a "greenhouse effect".​</a>

Write your answer on a pad paper or bond paper. End 1. When in the electrical/ electronic circuit section, prior to pre-testing, consider voltage measurement on components first before removing it for testing. If the measured voltage is normal, the component might be the cause of the problem. Either way, if the measured voltage is not normal (increased or decreased) the preceding circuit/components might be the cause. 2. If the trouble symptom is caused by the defective component is usually one of them However, in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to 3. Be familiar with the usual of components. (e.g. capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open/ resistor increase their resistance when they become defective/ semi-conductors such as transistors usuallyj become open or shorted) 4. Don't replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have 5. Check the for its faulty contact before assuming defective electronic components. 6. When measuring resistance in the circuit, make sure that the circuit if and power is not being supplied in the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-milliameter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter, 7. While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the with the approximate resistance 8. Use soldering irons with the to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. Soldering iron tips should be cleaned and preferably slim. 9. Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. 10. Dry solder joints are However, when they are found or suspected, remove the with components from the PCB; then, file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off.​</a>

                            10. 17. Heat deep in the core of the Earth continually escapes toward the surface. As the heat rises, it warm rock, which begin to rise slowly. This molten rock or magma, usually cools within. Sometimes, however, magma continues to push upward. It absorbs water in the ground and heats it to produce steam or gas. Gas- filled magma is lighter and can rise through a series of channels toward the surface When it reaches a vent or opening in the surface it spews out. Magma that erupts from a vent is called lava, reaching temperature of more than 1000 degrees centigrade When cooled the lava and other materials, such as ash and rocks, build up to form the cone of a volcano. 18. Whole year-round typhoons occur. It is always good to prepare for the coming of any typhoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if necessary, repair or fixing is needed. With this, cleaning up the house drainage system is a must to avoid clogging up. Next, store an adequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Everything in the should be put in an elevated position, especially those items that generate electricity. Water should not penetrate into them in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries, and first aid supplies 19. Moist air and heat are necessary for hurricanes to start and to keep on going. As the surface of the ocean heats up the water goes up into the air. This warm air becomes moist. It starts to form a column. The air around rushes toward the column and forms a spiral around it. The system is called cyclone. As the column of air becomes warmer, the winds blow faster. If the storm reaches 119 kph, a hurricane is born. Hurricanes often cover areas up to 300 kilometers wide. They may last a few hours or for two weeks. They cause heavy rains that swell and overflow rivers. The strong winds produce floods. 20. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a "greenhouse effect".​</h2><br />

lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny
tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they
grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like

                            21. Directions: Read the following short texts and distinguish whether it is SEQUENTIAL, CAUSAL, orCONSEQUENTIAL.______16.A tsunami is a series of large waves generated by an abrupt movement on the oceanfloor that can result from an earthquake, an underwater landslide, a volcanic eruption or - veryrarely - a large meteorite strike. However, powerful undersea earthquakes are responsible for mosttsunamis.____17. Heat deep in the core of the Earth continually escapes toward the surface. As the heatrises, it warm rock, which begin to rise slowly. This molten rock, or magma, usually cools within.Sometimes, however, magma continues to push upward. It absorbs water in the ground and heats itto produce steam or gas. Gas-filled magma is lighter and can rise through a series of channelstoward the surface. When it reaches a vent or opening in the surface it spews out. Magma thaterupts from a vent is called lava, reaching temperature of more than 1000 degrees centigrade. Whencooled the lava and other materials, such as ash and rocks, build up to form the cone of a volcano.____18. Whole-year round typhoons occur. It is always good to prepare for the coming of anytyphoon as predicted. First and foremost, inspect your house if necessary repair or fixing is needed.With this, cleaning up the house drainage system is a must to avoid clogging up. Next, store anadequate supply of food and water good for a few days. Everything in the should be put in anelevated position, especially those items that generate electricity. Water should not penetrate intothem in case floodwater rushes into your house. Lastly, always keep flashlights, candles, batteries,and first aid supplies.____19.. Moist air and heat are necessary for hurricanes to start and to keep on going. As thesurface of the ocean heats up, the water goes up into the air. This warm air becomes moist. It startsto form a column. The air around rushes toward the column and forms a spiral around it. The systemis called cyclone. As the column of air becomes warmer, the winds blow faster. If the storm reaches119 kph, a hurricane is born. Hurricanes often cover areas up to 300 kilometers wide. They may lasta few hours or for two weeks. They cause heavy rains that swell and overflow rivers. The strongwinds produce floods.____20. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convertland from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It iscalled a greenhouse gas because it produces a "greenhouse effect".​</h2><br />

Write your answer on a pad paper or bond paper. End 1. When in the electrical/ electronic circuit section, prior to pre-testing, consider voltage measurement on components first before removing it for testing. If the measured voltage is normal, the component might be the cause of the problem. Either way, if the measured voltage is not normal (increased or decreased) the preceding circuit/components might be the cause. 2. If the trouble symptom is caused by the defective component is usually one of them However, in high-power-handling circuits, a defective component may cause other components to 3. Be familiar with the usual of components. (e.g. capacitors usually become leaky, shorted or open/ resistor increase their resistance when they become defective/ semi-conductors such as transistors usuallyj become open or shorted) 4. Don't replace an opened fuse or burned resistor unless you have 5. Check the for its faulty contact before assuming defective electronic components. 6. When measuring resistance in the circuit, make sure that the circuit if and power is not being supplied in the circuit, and that stored charges in capacitors are properly discharged. Failure to do so can damage the volt-ohm-milliameter (VOM) and the circuit due to the low resistance of the ohmmeter, 7. While using a VOM for in-circuit resistance measurement, always exchange the setting of positive and negative probes. Take the with the approximate resistance 8. Use soldering irons with the to prevent the components and the circuit board from being overheated and damaged. Soldering iron tips should be cleaned and preferably slim. 9. Use proper tools and soldering aids when troubleshooting Ground the soldering iron to avoid damaging ICs and transistors. 10. Dry solder joints are However, when they are found or suspected, remove the with components from the PCB; then, file or clean the leads and solder the joints back. Reheating a new soldering lead is another remedy. When re-soldering, make sure you do not overheat the components. Overheating the PCB may cause the copper layer on it to warp and peel off.​</h2><br />
