Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.

                                            SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One aspect of project management that makes it more demanding than a typical managerial role is the need for adaptability and flexibility. In a project management role, the manager must be able to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and adjust their plans and strategies accordingly. For example, if a key team member unexpectedly leaves the project, the project manager must quickly find a replacement and adjust the project timeline to account for the lost time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Another aspect of project management that makes it more demanding is the need for strong communication and collaboration skills. In a project management role, the manager must be able to effectively communicate with a wide range of stakeholders, including team members, clients, and upper management. This requires strong interpersonal skills and the ability to effectively coordinate and manage the efforts of multiple individuals and teams. For example, a project manager may need to hold regular meetings with team members to ensure that everyone is on track and working towards the project goals, as well as communicate with clients to provide updates on progress and address any concerns or issues that arise.</p><p></p><p>Finally, project management can be more demanding than a typical managerial role due to the high level of accountability and responsibility that is involved. In a project management role, the manager is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the specified quality standards. This requires a high level of attention to detail and the ability to effectively manage risks and potential issues that may arise during the project. For example, a project manager may need to monitor the project budget and expenses closely to ensure that the project stays within budget, or address any delays or setbacks that occur in order to prevent the project from falling behind schedule.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Listen to important details.Rapid Urbanization"Today, 50 percent of the Asian population lives in cities. Urbanization has critical implications fordevelopment, since cities are the locus of most social change, most of the demand for more transparent andaccountable government, and the bulk of economic output. The burdens on urban governance are immense,overstretched infrastructure and services constrain economic growth, increase communal conflict, andsignificantly reduce the overall quality of life, especially for the poor. On top of these challenges, Asia's bulgingcities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental disasters: 51 of the 100 cities with the greatest exposure tonatural hazards are in Asia.For example, in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, the population has nearly doubled in the last decade,and new construction has driven thousands from the city center to peri-urban areas where services are few ornon-existent, and poor waste management threatens the city's health and economic viability. As part of our workon urban governance we brought together local governments and communities in these areas to raiseawareness of issues like waste management, and prepared a memorandum of solutions for waste collectionand disposal for the governor of Phnom Penh from the Municipal Waste Authority. Now we are collaborating withsolid-waste collectors and City Hall to develop a plan to improve and reform city services and put ideas intoaction."Source: "Six Pressing issues in Asia and How We're Adapting Our Approach to Address Them" by DavidAmold.

                            15. SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.
