                                            I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

Continuing Love
Written for the Agnes Locsin dance A Love Story, in honour of Carmen D. Locsin
6.
God lives in trees and speaks 
the languages of winds,
shadows, light, laughter.
Always the birds bring in new seeds
and the waves new water—as if
they have not done that before, as if
they had not always done that 
as before, as if they were not here 
in the beginning after all. 
New buds flower, dry up, and drop
from their stems. Suddenly,
a big shadow is upon us, and in a snap
the truck moves on and light springs back
on old familiars.
Frisky little bodies plunge into the water 
and the waters receive them.
The work of memories and affections 
is the work of water, earth, and fire.
Were we where we were, 
or will we be where we’ll be?
A hand takes us, and we take the hand.
We feel the earth push back our feet, 
and we move on
to feed the birds, or watch
the goldfish breathe out ripples
on the surface of the dug-out pond.</a>

cause-effect. On the space provided before the number, put a ( / ) if the text is a
cause-effect text and ( × ) if it does not.
1. There are many reasons why our class goes to the library once a week for what
we call “Book Hour.” For one, our teacher has observed that many of us read
poorly when asked to read aloud a story or poem in class. Another reason is
that most of us at home have an Internet provider. As a result, our teacher has
noticed that the home research we submit are lifted from online references.
When our teacher checked our borrowings from the library, most of us have
not brought home a storybook or reference related to the different subjects.
Thus, for many weeks now, we get to hold books and do our readings for an
hour in the library.
2. If you are looking for fun this summer, what better place to go but to our newly

3. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are
caused by exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural
events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air,
especially in highly urbanized towns, cities, mainly because the government
lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise,
the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories
that emit gas elsewhere. Most often than not, air pollution is caused by natural
events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion and pollen
dispersal.
4. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel
like interacting with your new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation
gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places
with your eyes but you have to spend much more for your fare, your food, and
the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily.
5. The water shortage that hit the country lately causes several problems.
Because of water shortage, public places like local restaurants and many other
places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</a>

The Tyger
by William Blake
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And, when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

                            5. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.
1. Describe the persona. What is he or she yearning for?
2. How does the poem describe the land of Africa? What does this imply about the feelings
of the persona?
3. What figures of speech are present in the poem? What do they mean?
4. What is the overall theme and message of the poem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.  The persona in the poem is a person who is longing to return to Africa, their homeland. The persona misses the beauty and culture of Africa, and yearns to experience it again.</p><p></p><p>2.  The poem describes Africa as a place of natural beauty, with forests, streams, and mountain passes. The persona fondly remembers the sounds of village dances and the music of the fiddle and fife. This implies that the persona has strong feelings of nostalgia and longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>3.  The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />

Continuing Love
Written for the Agnes Locsin dance A Love Story, in honour of Carmen D. Locsin
6.
God lives in trees and speaks 
the languages of winds,
shadows, light, laughter.
Always the birds bring in new seeds
and the waves new water—as if
they have not done that before, as if
they had not always done that 
as before, as if they were not here 
in the beginning after all. 
New buds flower, dry up, and drop
from their stems. Suddenly,
a big shadow is upon us, and in a snap
the truck moves on and light springs back
on old familiars.
Frisky little bodies plunge into the water 
and the waters receive them.
The work of memories and affections 
is the work of water, earth, and fire.
Were we where we were, 
or will we be where we’ll be?
A hand takes us, and we take the hand.
We feel the earth push back our feet, 
and we move on
to feed the birds, or watch
the goldfish breathe out ripples
on the surface of the dug-out pond.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The two poems here are my most recent productions, written when I was winding up my commitments as bureaucrat and testing again the much-missed pool of ink for living lines and resonant images. My concerns here are countrified and rural, more natural and airier, and unwilling to prove anything to the world out there of social media.</p><p></p><p>‘Continuing Love’ and ‘A Kink of Burning’ were written for Agnes Locsin, who turned them into dance. The former was featured in her tribute to her mother Carmen some four years before her death in 2011. It was a mini biography of Mrs. Locsin as told to me by Agnes. The latter had a stanza translated into Filipino and also featured in her latest work ‘Dahon: Ikalawang Galaw’ (‘Leaf: Second Movement’) early this year. The poems are therefore about death and life and art and woman and creation, and the energies of natural elements around us that will outlive our shining human moments — themes that continue to fascinate me since I first started to write as a boy with a broken heart.</p><p></p><p>Continuing Love</p><p>Written for the Agnes Locsin dance A Love Story, in honour of Carmen D.

cause-effect text and ( × ) if it does not.
1. There are many reasons why our class goes to the library once a week for what
we call “Book Hour.” For one, our teacher has observed that many of us read
poorly when asked to read aloud a story or poem in class. Another reason is
that most of us at home have an Internet provider. As a result, our teacher has
noticed that the home research we submit are lifted from online references.
When our teacher checked our borrowings from the library, most of us have
not brought home a storybook or reference related to the different subjects.
Thus, for many weeks now, we get to hold books and do our readings for an
hour in the library.
2. If you are looking for fun this summer, what better place to go but to our newly

3. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are
caused by exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural
events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air,
especially in highly urbanized towns, cities, mainly because the government
lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise,
the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories
that emit gas elsewhere. Most often than not, air pollution is caused by natural
events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion and pollen
dispersal.
4. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel
like interacting with your new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation
gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places
with your eyes but you have to spend much more for your fare, your food, and
the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily.
5. The water shortage that hit the country lately causes several problems.
Because of water shortage, public places like local restaurants and many other
places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</h2><br />

                            11. Read the poem.
The Tyger
by William Blake
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And, when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did He smile His work to see?
Did He who made the lamb make thee?
Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
