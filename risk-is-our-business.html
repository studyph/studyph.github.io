                                            1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

                                            Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then plummeted and most businesses suffered. The economy is Iike a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around.a.

Politician A: It's been 3 months since our province was placed on permanent lockdown by the national government. The Taal Volcano eruption has brought to problem to the province's economy, particularly tourism. it is now the right time to open our place for tourists for us to have income again. if we have more funds, we can help a lot of people , especially for those who have lost their homes and other properties.
Politician B: No, it's not yet the right time because as what PHIVOLCS said, Alert level 1 means that the volcano is still in abnormal condition. If we open our place again for tourists, we cannot assure their safety and security.
Politician A: But we are already exhausted, If we open business again, we gain funds. Thus, we can help and save people's lives.
Politician B: No, if we open businesses again, we do not save people but we put people's lives on risk.
Question: if you were, politician C, how would you react to the same issue?</a>

My concerns are many and widespread, but let me identify eight risks that are particularly pressing: First, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further erode trust in public institutions, particularly if citizens perceive that their authorities mishandled the response or are not transparent on the scope of the crisis. ____ 2. . Every country is now grappling with or poised to suffer the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: the tens of thousands of lost lives; the broken families; the overwhelmed hospitals; the overworked essential workers. ___ 3. While the COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis, its implications are much more far-reaching. We are already seeing its ruinous social and economic impacts, as governments around the world struggle to find the most effective responses to rising unemployment and the economic downturn.___ 4. We are all struggling to absorb the unfolding shock: the jobs that have disappeared and businesses that have suffered; the fundamental and drastic shift to our daily lives, and the fear that the worst is still yet to come, especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict. ___ 5. But the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security -- potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.​</h2><br />

                            16. 1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

                            18. 9. Many people are confused about why are our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actuallythe result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were highrisk or unworthy of credit or borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible for large loans. Second,banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurancefirms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of theease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth of housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intendingto sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculations. These bubbles burst,sending the whole market into a downward spiral , causing employees to lose capital and lay off employees,Consumer spending then plummeted and most business suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it getsmoving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around.a. sequenceb. cause and effect C. comparison and contrastd. description/enumeration​</h2><br />

For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever.

Politician A: It's been 3 months since our province was placed on permanent lockdown by the national government. The Taal Volcano eruption has brought to problem to the province's economy, particularly tourism. it is now the right time to open our place for tourists for us to have income again. if we have more funds, we can help a lot of people , especially for those who have lost their homes and other properties.
Politician B: No, it's not yet the right time because as what PHIVOLCS said, Alert level 1 means that the volcano is still in abnormal condition. If we open our place again for tourists, we cannot assure their safety and security.
Politician A: But we are already exhausted, If we open business again, we gain funds. Thus, we can help and save people's lives.
Politician B: No, if we open businesses again, we do not save people but we put people's lives on risk.
Question: if you were, politician C, how would you react to the same issue?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Politician C: I agree with Politician B. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We should wait for the "Go" and safety signal of the ones who are responsible for observing Taal volcano. People's lives are in danger if we build business again in that particular area without checking and receiving the approval of the professionals who are checking Taal. We can't risk seeing people dying. As part of that, the victims of the eruption still receives goods and we will be giving and donating basic human needs to them. And politician A, already said that the place is in TEMPORARY lockdown, it is simply just temporary and not permanent. I don't have a problem with the victims being in lockdown, If I were to be with them also and be a victim, I wont have a problem with it. They (Professionals) are making a move to it.
