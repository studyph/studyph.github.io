Identifying the Market Segment for a Product
by Neil Kokemuller
Some products appeal to multiple customer segments for different uses or reasons.
Identifying the right market segments for a given product is key to attracting customers, generating revenue and earning optimal profit for your small business. While a number of approaches are used to target segments for a product, a distinct customer base that you want to target should be accessible and offer measurable marketing opportunities.
Lifestyle Interests
While demographics are a common way for companies to segment markets, using this approach isn't always the best way to find the commonality among consumers for a given product. Identifying target customers based on shared lifestyle interests and activities might offer you more clarity. A high-quality baseball glove brand, like Wilson's or Rawling's, for instance, typically targets more serious players at high school, college and professional levels for their brands.
Benefits
In some cases, your products make segmentation simpler because they offer a few concrete, unique benefits that appeal to varied customer groups. Cars are a great example. Typically, people don't expect to get every possible benefit of a car in one purchase. For instance, high-end luxury buyers understand they will pay a higher price. Similarly, economy buyers know better fuel efficiency often means limited luxury features. When car companies target market segments, they normally identify distinct, major benefits of their products and then outline the main objectives of buyers for each benefit category.</a>

Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

Identifying the Market Segment for a Product
by Neil Kokemuller
Some products appeal to multiple customer segments for different uses or reasons.
Identifying the right market segments for a given product is key to attracting customers, generating revenue and earning optimal profit for your small business. While a number of approaches are used to target segments for a product, a distinct customer base that you want to target should be accessible and offer measurable marketing opportunities.
Lifestyle Interests
While demographics are a common way for companies to segment markets, using this approach isn't always the best way to find the commonality among consumers for a given product. Identifying target customers based on shared lifestyle interests and activities might offer you more clarity. A high-quality baseball glove brand, like Wilson's or Rawling's, for instance, typically targets more serious players at high school, college and professional levels for their brands.
Benefits
In some cases, your products make segmentation simpler because they offer a few concrete, unique benefits that appeal to varied customer groups. Cars are a great example. Typically, people don't expect to get every possible benefit of a car in one purchase. For instance, high-end luxury buyers understand they will pay a higher price. Similarly, economy buyers know better fuel efficiency often means limited luxury features. When car companies target market segments, they normally identify distinct, major benefits of their products and then outline the main objectives of buyers for each benefit category.</h2><br />
                        A Market Segment is simply described as a group of people who share one or more common characteristics. eg. A group of fashionistas who are into luxury bags, or a group who are into books etc.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />"Some products appeal to multiple customer segments for different uses or reasons."  -  for example your product is a book, then your customer segments are most likely to be book enthusiasts and so forth<br /><br />Lifestyle Interests, Benefits are factors in making a market segment.<br />Classifying your customers according to their lifestyle and the other one according to what benefits will that product give to them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1.

Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
