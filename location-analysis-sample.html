If not, what are the things missing in the methodology? 20 points. In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire. It was developed by the researchers although some of the questionnaires were based from other studies and resources available in the books.​</a>

To be able to attain the best of social functioning and to capacitate individuals and groups, trainings andseminars on personal and community development are conducted by the social worker2. The applied social sciences allow us to understand the details of the different structural problems and how itchanges through time3. Disaster risks cannot be prevented and mitigated through the use of applied social science4. Social workers play vital roles in peace negotiations and resolution of political tensions and violence throughthe application of peace-building processes and conflict management mechanisms5. Examples of behavioral focus on self-development are improving the grooming skills and personal hygiene6. Community social workers will serve as agents of information by offering latest updates that can help themmake important attitude and value changes7. Applied social scientist cannot communicate to the people the impact of these social and environmentalphenomena8. Philippines is at risk of climate-related calamities due to its geographical location9. Disaster capacity building, and reduction of population exposure and vulnerability measures were taken forgranted10. In order to solicit the active participation of the people in the community, it is important that they understandthe basic concepts of hazard, risk, and vulnerability11. Case studies are systematic and critical investigation of a situation that poses a problem and necessitatessuggested solutions, recommendations, and pathway to avoid related problems in future12. A case study analysis does not require you to investigate a problem, examine the alternative solutions13. Case studies are used by teachers to see how learners can apply received knowledge in daily situations14.

                                            The study was conducted in the general area of Tablas Strait, in Mansalay Bay, on the island of Mindoro, central Philippines . The study site has a multispecies seagrass area starting at the intertidal zone to a depth of 1 meter. Between 1.5 to 2 meters in depth, coral bommies occur. Sand and rubble area with sporadic Halophila patches are found at 2–10-meter depths. The population survey was done for eight consecutive quarters starting in September 2011. A systematic search of aggregations was done by deploying an imaginary transect belt with a 20-meter width. A paddle boat was rowed, and made a survey stop every 50-meter distance. Aggregations were searched within a 20-meters radius of the boat. The search was aided by local fishermen who are used to looking for visual signs of aggregations from water surface down to 10-meters depth. As a preliminary to establishing the species' age frequency data, an investigation of whether shape changes with age was conducted. A total of 256 individuals were collected by hand randomly from the observed aggregations to serve as test organisms. Animals were boiled to facilitate the cleaning of the shells. An a-priori aging was done based on the length and lip thickness (Poiner and Catterall 1988; Catterall et al. 2001): &lt; 10 mm length are early recruits; 20–30 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are yearlings; 30–40 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are young adults; 30–45 mm length with 2.1-3.9 mm lip thickness as adults; and 30–45 mm length with &gt; 4 mm lip thickness as mature adults. The shells were later photographed laying on their adaxial side using a Canon S95 digital camera with grid settings to assist in focusing on the image. Positioning was made constant by making the suture between the lip and the body whorl constantly visible on the image and the central portion of the shell filling the center quadrat of the camera grid. This was facilitated by setting the shell on clay dough to prevent toppling. Acquired images were edited using Microsoft® Office Picture Manager retaining 1-centimeter space around each image. Ten (10) landmarks and 29 semi-landmarks were digitized along the surface of the captured images using tpsDig by Rohlf (2005)are specific features that can easily be located, such as tips, maximum curvatures, and sutures, while semi-landmarks are points with relative positions from a landmark or along a surface (Zelditch et al. 2004). The acquired spatial points were converted into coordinates by tpsRelW (Rohlf 2003), which allowed data processing as shape variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was done in MorphoJ (Klininger 2011) to determine possible age differences. Finally, the maximization of group separation was done with Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA). All individuals from observed aggregations were photographed on their adaxial side in situ. Shells heavily encrusted with algae were lightly cleaned to expose the shell outline. Photos were processed using the same methodologies done on test organisms. A total of 3,624 individuals were used for this study. Using the values from the CVA of the test organisms, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) in R (R Core Team 2016) was applied to age sample individuals to derive the age frequency distribution. Then, the derived age frequency data were used to compute growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment patterns, exploitation rate, and yield per recruit using FiSAT (FAO-ICLAM Assessment Tool) package (Gayanilo et al. 2005). Growth was assumed to be described by von Bertalanffy equation which had been proven to apply to bivalves and other gastropods (Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014; del NorteCampos and Villarta 2010; Al-Barwani et al. 2007; Cob et al. 2009; Tumanda et al. 1997). The estimated maximum size when species is not caught (L∞), as well as the constant growth rate (K), was initially estimated by scanning for possible values given the age-frequency distribution using Elefan I in FISAT (Tumanda et al. 1997; Cob et al. 2008; Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014). The values were confirmed with the subsequent fitting of derived age-frequency values where the Rn-value is the highest. Subsequently, the best combination of L∞ and K was taken using the Powell-Wetherall plot to take the proportion of total mortality (Z) and the growth rate (K). The K-value was taken as an approximation of the natural mortality (M) value which applies to exploited stocks that make a collection of natural mortality data impossible (Tumanda et al. 1997). For this approximation, the second point representing the yearling group (Age 1) was assumed to be fully recruited to the fishery. Total mortality (Z) was estimated with Ault and Ehrhardt method in the FiSAT II package. The model was chosen with its relaxed assumption on the lifespan of the species being analyzed.EXPLAIN? ​</a>

In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire. It was developed by the researchers although some of the questionnaires were based from other studies and resources available in the books.​</h2><br />

The applied social sciences allow us to understand the details of the different structural problems and how itchanges through time3. Disaster risks cannot be prevented and mitigated through the use of applied social science4. Social workers play vital roles in peace negotiations and resolution of political tensions and violence throughthe application of peace-building processes and conflict management mechanisms5. Examples of behavioral focus on self-development are improving the grooming skills and personal hygiene6. Community social workers will serve as agents of information by offering latest updates that can help themmake important attitude and value changes7. Applied social scientist cannot communicate to the people the impact of these social and environmentalphenomena8.

                            15. The study was conducted in the general area of Tablas Strait, in Mansalay Bay, on the island of Mindoro, central Philippines . The study site has a multispecies seagrass area starting at the intertidal zone to a depth of 1 meter. Between 1.5 to 2 meters in depth, coral bommies occur. Sand and rubble area with sporadic Halophila patches are found at 2–10-meter depths. The population survey was done for eight consecutive quarters starting in September 2011. A systematic search of aggregations was done by deploying an imaginary transect belt with a 20-meter width. A paddle boat was rowed, and made a survey stop every 50-meter distance. Aggregations were searched within a 20-meters radius of the boat. The search was aided by local fishermen who are used to looking for visual signs of aggregations from water surface down to 10-meters depth. As a preliminary to establishing the species' age frequency data, an investigation of whether shape changes with age was conducted. A total of 256 individuals were collected by hand randomly from the observed aggregations to serve as test organisms. Animals were boiled to facilitate the cleaning of the shells. An a-priori aging was done based on the length and lip thickness (Poiner and Catterall 1988; Catterall et al. 2001): &lt; 10 mm length are early recruits; 20–30 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are yearlings; 30–40 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are young adults; 30–45 mm length with 2.1-3.9 mm lip thickness as adults; and 30–45 mm length with &gt; 4 mm lip thickness as mature adults. The shells were later photographed laying on their adaxial side using a Canon S95 digital camera with grid settings to assist in focusing on the image. Positioning was made constant by making the suture between the lip and the body whorl constantly visible on the image and the central portion of the shell filling the center quadrat of the camera grid. This was facilitated by setting the shell on clay dough to prevent toppling. Acquired images were edited using Microsoft® Office Picture Manager retaining 1-centimeter space around each image. Ten (10) landmarks and 29 semi-landmarks were digitized along the surface of the captured images using tpsDig by Rohlf (2005)are specific features that can easily be located, such as tips, maximum curvatures, and sutures, while semi-landmarks are points with relative positions from a landmark or along a surface (Zelditch et al. 2004). The acquired spatial points were converted into coordinates by tpsRelW (Rohlf 2003), which allowed data processing as shape variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was done in MorphoJ (Klininger 2011) to determine possible age differences. Finally, the maximization of group separation was done with Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA). All individuals from observed aggregations were photographed on their adaxial side in situ. Shells heavily encrusted with algae were lightly cleaned to expose the shell outline. Photos were processed using the same methodologies done on test organisms. A total of 3,624 individuals were used for this study. Using the values from the CVA of the test organisms, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) in R (R Core Team 2016) was applied to age sample individuals to derive the age frequency distribution. Then, the derived age frequency data were used to compute growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment patterns, exploitation rate, and yield per recruit using FiSAT (FAO-ICLAM Assessment Tool) package (Gayanilo et al. 2005). Growth was assumed to be described by von Bertalanffy equation which had been proven to apply to bivalves and other gastropods (Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014; del NorteCampos and Villarta 2010; Al-Barwani et al. 2007; Cob et al. 2009; Tumanda et al. 1997). The estimated maximum size when species is not caught (L∞), as well as the constant growth rate (K), was initially estimated by scanning for possible values given the age-frequency distribution using Elefan I in FISAT (Tumanda et al. 1997; Cob et al. 2008; Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014). The values were confirmed with the subsequent fitting of derived age-frequency values where the Rn-value is the highest. Subsequently, the best combination of L∞ and K was taken using the Powell-Wetherall plot to take the proportion of total mortality (Z) and the growth rate (K). The K-value was taken as an approximation of the natural mortality (M) value which applies to exploited stocks that make a collection of natural mortality data impossible (Tumanda et al. 1997). For this approximation, the second point representing the yearling group (Age 1) was assumed to be fully recruited to the fishery. Total mortality (Z) was estimated with Ault and Ehrhardt method in the FiSAT II package. The model was chosen with its relaxed assumption on the lifespan of the species being analyzed.EXPLAIN? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> a study that was conducted on a species of snail in the Tablas Strait, in the Philippines. The study aimed to determine the age frequency distribution of the snails and to use this information to calculate various population parameters, such as growth, mortality rates, and exploitation rates. The study used a combination of field observations and laboratory analysis to collect and analyze data on the snails. The field observations involved systematically searching for aggregations of the snails in a specific area, and the laboratory analysis involved cleaning and photographing the shells of the snails and using software to digitize and analyze their shapes. The results of the analysis were used to age individual snails and to calculate population parameters.</p><br />
