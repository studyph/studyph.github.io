Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</a>

"Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</h2><br />
