                    <p>Technically, environment is the sum total of all the surroundings wherebyliving organism, including natural forces and other living things interact. Thisprovides also the conditions for the development and growth as well as of dangerand damage that might happen. There are different types of environment andcach is characterized by certain conditions.Environment mainly consistsof atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. Some of these typesof environment are:1. The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living thingsoccurring naturally. It is made up of naturally occurring resources like water,land, air and all organisms that live in nature. It comprises the nature of theliving space.This is in contrast to artificial environment or man-madeenvironment like in a fishpond.2. Industrial environment is a term used to describe working conditions that maybe outside of your home. Industrial environments are usually harsher thannormal work environments, such as in anoffice. In an industrial environment,people and equipment are exposed to more extreme conditions,3. The social environment consists of the sum total of a society&#039;s beliefs, customs,practices and behaviors. It is, to a large extent, an artificial construct that can becontrasted with the natural environment in which we live.​</p>

Biodiversity is a compound word derived from ‘biological diversity’. It is a term used to describe the variety of living things on earth.2. A community is a group of living things within a certain area that are all of the same species.3. A population of one kind does not affect a population of another kind within the community.4. Ecosystem Diversity is considered as a complex level of diversity.5. Scientists use a formula called the population index to describe the amount of species diversity in a given area.6. A community with very low index of diversity is more at risk of extinction if environmental changes occur.7. A community with very high index of diversity consisting of many species has a better chance of including individuals that might be able to adapt to changes in the environment.8. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with the physical environment. 9. An ecosystem is composed only of biotic (living) components.10. Limiting factors are usually expressed as a lack of a particular resource which can be biotic or abiotic that affect an ecosystem and the organisms in it.11. An increase in biodiversity also increases the adaptability of the ecosystem to changing environmental conditions; thus, increasingthe population density12. High biodiversity decreases the survival of organisms in an ecosystem.13. Low biodiversity can lead to species extinction. 14. When the population of a species decreases rapidly, the species is considered endangered.15. A species is considered threatened when its population is very low.16. Extinction occurs when the last members of that species die.17. Ecological imbalance happens when there is a disturbance that disrupts the balance of an ecosystem.18. The trapping of heat by gases in the earth’s atmosphere is called greenhouse effect.19. Global warming is an increase in the earth’s temperature from the rapid buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.20. Greenhouse effect is a man-made process​</a>

                            3. Write TRUE if the statement is correct. If the statement is false, change the underlined word by writing the correct answer on your paper.1. Biodiversity is a compound word derived from ‘biological diversity’. It is a term used to describe the variety of living things on earth.2. A community is a group of living things within a certain area that are all of the same species.3. A population of one kind does not affect a population of another kind within the community.4. Ecosystem Diversity is considered as a complex level of diversity.5. Scientists use a formula called the population index to describe the amount of species diversity in a given area.6. A community with very low index of diversity is more at risk of extinction if environmental changes occur.7. A community with very high index of diversity consisting of many species has a better chance of including individuals that might be able to adapt to changes in the environment.8. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with the physical environment. 9. An ecosystem is composed only of biotic (living) components.10. Limiting factors are usually expressed as a lack of a particular resource which can be biotic or abiotic that affect an ecosystem and the organisms in it.11. An increase in biodiversity also increases the adaptability of the ecosystem to changing environmental conditions; thus, increasingthe population density12. High biodiversity decreases the survival of organisms in an ecosystem.13. Low biodiversity can lead to species extinction. 14. When the population of a species decreases rapidly, the species is considered endangered.15. A species is considered threatened when its population is very low.16. Extinction occurs when the last members of that species die.17. Ecological imbalance happens when there is a disturbance that disrupts the balance of an ecosystem.18. The trapping of heat by gases in the earth’s atmosphere is called greenhouse effect.19. Global warming is an increase in the earth’s temperature from the rapid buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.20. Greenhouse effect is a man-made process​</h2><br />
