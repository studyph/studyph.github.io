                                            In the beginning there was only sky, sea, and a single bird. The bird grew tired and, while looking for a place to rest. stirred up the sea until its waters reached the sky. The sky then showered the sea with islands in order to calm it down and told the bird to pick an island to build its nest there. One day, the bird was struck by a bamboo pole, the child of the land and sea breezes. Annoyed, the bird struck at the nodes of the bamboo until it split. From one hall a man, Malakas ("strong one") emerged and from the other half a woman, Maganda ("beautiful one"). Then the earthquake called on all the birds and fish to see what should be done with these two, and it was decided that they should marry. They had a great number of children. 1.)what is the title of the selection/text? 2.)what are the main characters in the story? 3.)what is the story all about? ​</a>

                                            Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.

                                            DIRECTIONS: in less than 75 words, summarize the given text. (10 points) As today's bride and groom celebrate their wedding, they have every excuse for being nervous. They exchange promises of lifelong fidelity and mutual support. However, all around them, they can see that many people do not and cannot keep these promises. Their own marriage has a one in three chance of divorce, if present tendencies continue. Traditional marriage is facing a crisis, at least in Britain. Not only are there more and more divorces, but the number of marriages is falling. Living together is more popular than before. The family is now no longer one man, one woman and their children. Instead, there are more and more families which include parents, half sisters and brothers, or even only one parent on her / his own. Although Britain is still conservative in its attitudes to marriage compared with other countries such as the USA, Sweden and Denmark, the future will probably see many more people living together before marriage - and more divorce. Interestingly, it is women rather than men who apply for divorce. Seven out of ten divorces are given to the wife. Also, one of the main reasons for divorce, chosen by ten times more women than men, is unreasonable or cruel behavior. Perhaps this means that women will tolerate less than they used to.​</a>

                                            "Heinz Steals the Drug"In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought it might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make, He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $ 1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So, Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store i to steal the drug-for his wife. QUESTIONS: 1. What is the problem in the story? 2. What was the husband's last resort to save his wife? 3. What can you say about the husband's behavior? Do you think it was right?4.Should the husband be punished?yes or no? state you reasons.5.If you were in that situation,what will you do?​</a>

She started to read and suddenly noticed that a man, sitting beside her, grabbed a cookie from her bag. She just tried to ignore this.So she munched cookies and at the same time watched how shameless cookie thief was diminishing her stocks. She thought to herself: „If I wasn‘t such a nice person, I would blacken his eye“.When only one cookie was left, she looked with interest and wondered what he would do. He smiled, took the last cookie and broke it in half. She thought: „This guy is so rude, he didn‘t even show any gratitude!”After her flight was called, the woman gathered her baggage and headed to gate. She took her seat in the plane, and started to look for her book, which was almost complete. As she reached her baggage, she gasped with surprise, as there was an unopened bag of cookies. A dreadful thought crossed her mind: „If my cookie bag is here, the other one was his and he just tried to share. She realized that she was the rude one, but it was too late to apologize.Give me 100 words of your realization about the story?​</a>

The sky then showered the sea with islands in order to calm it down and told the bird to pick an island to build its nest there. One day, the bird was struck by a bamboo pole, the child of the land and sea breezes. Annoyed, the bird struck at the nodes of the bamboo until it split. From one hall a man, Malakas ("strong one") emerged and from the other half a woman, Maganda ("beautiful one"). Then the earthquake called on all the birds and fish to see what should be done with these two, and it was decided that they should marry.

                            12. Why the Sky is High(Tagalog) In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on earth. As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father’s right hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him. On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the housework came to be Daskol’s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house and did the cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in the pounding, Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.  One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.(Iloko)In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison which the man had brought from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and hang them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So, she requested the sky to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the 
woman again asked the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So, the woman again asked the sky to go higher. Again, It thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the woman remembered what she had hung, It was too late. They became the moon and the stars. (Hiligaynon)In the olden days, the sky was so low…so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and they did not need to work.Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost the food would be on the table. But after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their living. With this change in their condition, came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would rest from their labors.One day, one of the chiefs Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao or native war dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief and it was acted by men brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill but forgot that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods was wounded. This angered God the father so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth.Think about thisBased on the texts read, compare the lives of the people before and after the sky rose.Use the organizer below to list down your observation.

                            24. DIRECTIONS: in less than 75 words, summarize the given text. (10 points) As today's bride and groom celebrate their wedding, they have every excuse for being nervous. They exchange promises of lifelong fidelity and mutual support. However, all around them, they can see that many people do not and cannot keep these promises. Their own marriage has a one in three chance of divorce, if present tendencies continue. Traditional marriage is facing a crisis, at least in Britain. Not only are there more and more divorces, but the number of marriages is falling. Living together is more popular than before. The family is now no longer one man, one woman and their children. Instead, there are more and more families which include parents, half sisters and brothers, or even only one parent on her / his own. Although Britain is still conservative in its attitudes to marriage compared with other countries such as the USA, Sweden and Denmark, the future will probably see many more people living together before marriage - and more divorce. Interestingly, it is women rather than men who apply for divorce. Seven out of ten divorces are given to the wife. Also, one of the main reasons for divorce, chosen by ten times more women than men, is unreasonable or cruel behavior. Perhaps this means that women will tolerate less than they used to.​</h2><br />

                            25. "Heinz Steals the Drug"In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought it might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make, He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $ 1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it." So, Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store i to steal the drug-for his wife. QUESTIONS: 1. What is the problem in the story? 2. What was the husband's last resort to save his wife? 3. What can you say about the husband's behavior? Do you think it was right?4.Should the husband be punished?yes or no? state you reasons.5.If you were in that situation,what will you do?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Heinz wife was near death</p><p>2. The drug that the druggist discovered</p><p>3. The desperation of her husband just for her to stay alive is cute, Yes if someone is nearly dying I would be desperate too.</p><p>4. No, because he only did that to save his dying wife.</p><p>5. I would also steal the drug because even if the druggist says that he discovered it and he will earn money from that, money is just something you can earn and waste but a life of a person lose it will never go back and you can never revive it.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Hope this helps</strong></p><br />

She started to read and suddenly noticed that a man, sitting beside her, grabbed a cookie from her bag. She just tried to ignore this.So she munched cookies and at the same time watched how shameless cookie thief was diminishing her stocks. She thought to herself: „If I wasn‘t such a nice person, I would blacken his eye“.When only one cookie was left, she looked with interest and wondered what he would do. He smiled, took the last cookie and broke it in half. She thought: „This guy is so rude, he didn‘t even show any gratitude!”After her flight was called, the woman gathered her baggage and headed to gate. She took her seat in the plane, and started to look for her book, which was almost complete. As she reached her baggage, she gasped with surprise, as there was an unopened bag of cookies.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>my realization in this story is that we should not judge a person immediately. before judging, we should first look at the situation or confront the person so that we could understand their point of view. we should learn how to understand a situation and not judge immediately just like how the girl in the story did, doing this might save us from embarrassment or help us be kinder to others. this also teaches us not to be close minded individuals who only cares about their situation and does not consider other people at all</p><br />
