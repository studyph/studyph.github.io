They were talking about their lesson on what they would like to be when they grow up. "When I grow up, I'll be a firefighter just like my dad," said Joey "I'll help people with houses on fire. I'll have my fire truck always ready? -When I grow up, I'll be a police officer,” said Charlie. "T'll do my best to keep our country peaceful and orderly. I'll always be watching out for people who steal and I'll run after them with my motorcycle." “T'll be a mailman when I grow up," said Ferdie. "I'll deliver mail and packages to the people in our town everyday. I'll see to it that my mailbag is emptied at the end of the day. “How about you, Riza? What would you want to be when you grow up?" asked Joey. -Oh, I'll be a teacher like my mother. I'll teach children how to read, write, and compute. Will you let me teach your children when we grow up?" asked Riza. "Sure, Riza, we'll do that,” said the three boys.

                                            A tortoise was resting under a tree, on which a bird had built it's nest. The tortoise spoke to the bird mockingly, "What a shabby home you have! It is made of broken twigs, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is much better than you pathetic nest". The bird replied, "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but i built it, and i like it." "I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though." "On the contrary", the bird replied. "My home has space for my family and friends; your she'll cannot accommodate anyone other than you. Maybe you have a better house. But i have a better home", said the bird happily. ano ang lesson learn​</a>

I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

                                            Read: A selection from Genesis 1:26-31
Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”
 So God created humankind in his image,
 in the image of God he created them;
 male and female he created them.
Read the full passage.
Listen:
Did you know that when God made humans, he made us to look like him? God made all the stars and planets, all the beluga whales and blue jays, all the buffalo and begonias—but God didn’t make any of those things in his image.
It was only when he made humans that he said, “Let’s make them like us.”
It’s true! Something about you is made to look just like God.
Is it your eyes? When you smile, do they crinkle at the corners, just like God’s do? Is it your hair? Does God have a cowlick in just the same place you do? Maybe it’s your laugh. When something is so silly you can hardly breathe, do you sound like God sounds?
It’s hard to know exactly what God looks and sounds like—except that we know what Jesus is like. Jesus is God in the form of a human being. Jesus looks exactly like God. He is God!
So if you’re wondering what about you resembles God, you can just think about Jesus. You might not have his hair color, and your body might be built differently than his, but your heart can look just like Jesus’s heart.
Wonder:
What things about you—your personality or your character—are like Jesus? Can you think of ways that God made you to look like him?</a>

Pia then asked, don't you thinkschooling is life itself? Like schooling is a way of life.Catriona just laughed at her friend and said, you go toschool. You absorb the information given by the teacher,they give a lecture, and then your graded. When you aregiven good grades, surely your smart, and that's an edgein the future. Pia thought deeper and said, my friend, letus agree to disagree. For me, schooling does not onlymeasure what you have in your brains that could have aquantitative description of how intelligent one could be.I believe schooling means we learn out from what wehad known, what we will learn, and how we assimilatethese lessons to real-life situations. Catriona then said,no matter what perspective we have, let's us agree, wewill finish schooling, and we would be professionalssoon.Guide Questions:1.

I'll have my fire truck always ready? -When I grow up, I'll be a police officer,” said Charlie. "T'll do my best to keep our country peaceful and orderly.

It is made of broken twigs, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is much better than you pathetic nest". The bird replied, "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but i built it, and i like it." "I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though." "On the contrary", the bird replied.

                            14. Hi, please help me to paraphrase, edit and add more necessary words and sentences in this essay below. I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The video instructs us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they're from, how they appear, and what religion they follow. They also demonstrated how they are denied the opportunuty to receive a higher education. In our lives, education is the most essential thing a person that has in life. It is considered to be the key to life. It is disheartening to realize thst many people do not obtain the same education as others just because of their differences. We must extract the stereotypes and labels that was invented centuries ago. We are now living in a contemporary society, we must effect change and just live a tranquil life. As they put it, "we all share the same cosmos", so we must treat each of us equally and fairly. Equality should be spread around the world.</p><br />

                            18. Read: A selection from Genesis 1:26-31
Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”
 So God created humankind in his image,
 in the image of God he created them;
 male and female he created them.
Read the full passage.
Listen:
Did you know that when God made humans, he made us to look like him? God made all the stars and planets, all the beluga whales and blue jays, all the buffalo and begonias—but God didn’t make any of those things in his image.
It was only when he made humans that he said, “Let’s make them like us.”
It’s true! Something about you is made to look just like God.
Is it your eyes? When you smile, do they crinkle at the corners, just like God’s do? Is it your hair? Does God have a cowlick in just the same place you do? Maybe it’s your laugh. When something is so silly you can hardly breathe, do you sound like God sounds?
It’s hard to know exactly what God looks and sounds like—except that we know what Jesus is like. Jesus is God in the form of a human being. Jesus looks exactly like God. He is God!
So if you’re wondering what about you resembles God, you can just think about Jesus. You might not have his hair color, and your body might be built differently than his, but your heart can look just like Jesus’s heart.
Wonder:
What things about you—your personality or your character—are like Jesus? Can you think of ways that God made you to look like him?</h2><br />
