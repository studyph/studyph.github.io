                            20. Write True if the statement is correct False if not1. Places at equator receive most solar energy because the sun strikes it most directly.2. Different parts of the Earth receive different amount of solar radiation because, besidesEarth is elliptical in shape, it is tilted a 23.5 on its axis. So distance from the equator (hattitude) affects thedimate of a place.3. Ocean current affects dimate because bodies of water will help regulate the temperature ofthe surroundings4. As altitude of an area increases the average temperature of the area decreases5.
