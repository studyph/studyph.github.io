                                            can someone answer this?The Story of ZacchaeusOne day Jesus traveled through a town named Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1. Who was Zacchaeus?2. Why didn’t people like him?3. How did Jesus treat Zacchaeus?4. How did Zacchaeus change after meeting Jesus?5. Why is honesty important in our relationships with other people?​</a>

"The Mysterious Ring of the Beautiful Queen"
The king of Calvar, King Damian, was long dead. His Kingdom can be found in the farthest east of the world. It was left to his wife, Reyna Marikit.
The king and queen had four sons. They are Prince Diego, Prince Faustino, Prince Tales, and the youngest, Prince Marfino. Many wonders which of the four princes will be the heir to the Kingdom.
Only one can inherit the Kingdom. Nevertheless, unbeknownst to many, it was not the Kingdom that the four princes wanted to inherit, if not their mother's magical ring.
Only King Damian and their children know that Queen Marikit's ring is the reason why the wealth of their Kingdom is inexhaustible.
One day, the queen felt that she was really weak and she needed to decide to whom to give a ring. He accepted that he could disappear at any time.
For the queen to know to whom she should give a ring, she called the four sons and gave them much gold.
"Go to the other Kingdom. In the Kingdom of Tipora. Each of you should bring two sacks of gold. It is up to you what you do with the gold you bring there, "the queen said to her four children.
The brothers quickly grabbed two sacks of gold each. They rode on their horses and set out for the Kingdom of Tiphsah. When they got there, Prince Diego saw the princess of Tipora.
'Oh beautiful princess, I'm sorry, but my sisters and I are here to see if you're all right here?' said the prince, to the surprise of his brothers.
The three princes left and left Prince Diego, who was very nice to the princess. They talked all day, but the princess obviously didn't like him until she heard some nice words.
"I have two sacks of gold. "I would like to give it to your kingdom as a gift," said Prince Diego, who changed the princess's treatment of him. Because of this, he got the heart of the princess.
While traveling in Tipora, Prince Faustino suddenly stopped at a place where many were selling beautiful garments and jewelry. He stayed there, and there he used the gold he was carrying.
'They belong to me, the next king of Calvar,' said the prince while shopping for clothes to buy.
As Prince Tales and Prince Marfino traveled, they came to a part of the Kingdom where many farmers, slaves, and beggars lived. There, Prince Tales handed out a sack of gold he was carrying.
"My brother doesn't seem to be feeling well. "Prince Marfino said to himself while watching what Prince Tales was doing.
Before dark, the brothers traveled back to Calvar. Prince Diego and Prince Faustino no longer carry gold. Prince Tales brought back a sack of gold, and Prince Marfino still had two sacks.
When they arrived at Calvar, the three princes immediately rested while Prince Tales headed to the Eucharist, the place in their Kingdom where ordinary workers lived.
There, the prince entered the houses and handed out the gold he had brought. The people were very happy about this.
The next day, Queen Marikit summoned the four princes. There he told his children his decision about the Kingdom and the magical ring.
"My dear prince's, I have decided to whom the rule of the Kingdom and the magical ring will go. It hurts me to choose you, but I have to do it, and I hope you understand.
Diego, PrinceI cannot give you a ring because it cannot be used for personal intentions. It does not belong to you like the gold you gave to the princess to get her. The Kingdom is its owner.
As Prince Faustino said, royalty is not measured by dress. It measures how you take care of your Kingdom, including its wealth.
Prince Marfino, you are the only one who did not use the gold you brought to Tipora. Even when you come home here, there is no discount. However, I hope you understand that the hidden wealth does not grow. Many people need it.
So, I decided that the next king of Calvar would be Prince Tales. The magical ring will also go to him. He is like your father, who wants to help the smallest people in the Kingdom.
Prince Tales also did not hesitate to help the poor in the other Kingdom. You know that the wealth provided.</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>aacbd sa na makatulong saiyo ganda</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>American women have long been involved in public eating places. In Early America a common pattern was set as wives partnered with husbands in operating dining rooms in taverns and inns – and then carried on alone. Elizabeth Fraunces, wife of Samuel Fraunces whose career is commemorated in New York City’s historic Fraunces Tavern, took over the tavern when her husband was named George Washington’s household steward. When Samuel died she continued in the business.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, in light of prudish restrictions placed on women later in the 19th century, women of the early 1800s ran establishments serving men almost exclusively. They supervised male waiters and provided steak and oysters accompanied by a full range of drinks from the bar. Running an eating place with a bar would be considered disreputable and unladylike as the century wore on.</p><p></p><p>Men far surpassed the number of women eating away from home through most of the 19th century. But as early as the 1830s women visiting town for shopping or religious gatherings came into the market for respectable places to eat. In response the proprietors of the Clinton Lunch in New York City opened a Ladies’ Ordinary in 1833 under the direction of the owner’s wife.</p><br />

A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

"The Mysterious Ring of the Beautiful Queen"
The king of Calvar, King Damian, was long dead. His Kingdom can be found in the farthest east of the world. It was left to his wife, Reyna Marikit.
The king and queen had four sons. They are Prince Diego, Prince Faustino, Prince Tales, and the youngest, Prince Marfino. Many wonders which of the four princes will be the heir to the Kingdom.
Only one can inherit the Kingdom. Nevertheless, unbeknownst to many, it was not the Kingdom that the four princes wanted to inherit, if not their mother's magical ring.
Only King Damian and their children know that Queen Marikit's ring is the reason why the wealth of their Kingdom is inexhaustible.
One day, the queen felt that she was really weak and she needed to decide to whom to give a ring. He accepted that he could disappear at any time.
For the queen to know to whom she should give a ring, she called the four sons and gave them much gold.
"Go to the other Kingdom. In the Kingdom of Tipora. Each of you should bring two sacks of gold. It is up to you what you do with the gold you bring there, "the queen said to her four children.
The brothers quickly grabbed two sacks of gold each. They rode on their horses and set out for the Kingdom of Tiphsah. When they got there, Prince Diego saw the princess of Tipora.
'Oh beautiful princess, I'm sorry, but my sisters and I are here to see if you're all right here?' said the prince, to the surprise of his brothers.
The three princes left and left Prince Diego, who was very nice to the princess. They talked all day, but the princess obviously didn't like him until she heard some nice words.
"I have two sacks of gold. "I would like to give it to your kingdom as a gift," said Prince Diego, who changed the princess's treatment of him. Because of this, he got the heart of the princess.
While traveling in Tipora, Prince Faustino suddenly stopped at a place where many were selling beautiful garments and jewelry. He stayed there, and there he used the gold he was carrying.
'They belong to me, the next king of Calvar,' said the prince while shopping for clothes to buy.
As Prince Tales and Prince Marfino traveled, they came to a part of the Kingdom where many farmers, slaves, and beggars lived. There, Prince Tales handed out a sack of gold he was carrying.
"My brother doesn't seem to be feeling well. "Prince Marfino said to himself while watching what Prince Tales was doing.
Before dark, the brothers traveled back to Calvar. Prince Diego and Prince Faustino no longer carry gold. Prince Tales brought back a sack of gold, and Prince Marfino still had two sacks.
When they arrived at Calvar, the three princes immediately rested while Prince Tales headed to the Eucharist, the place in their Kingdom where ordinary workers lived.
There, the prince entered the houses and handed out the gold he had brought. The people were very happy about this.
The next day, Queen Marikit summoned the four princes. There he told his children his decision about the Kingdom and the magical ring.
"My dear prince's, I have decided to whom the rule of the Kingdom and the magical ring will go. It hurts me to choose you, but I have to do it, and I hope you understand.
Diego, PrinceI cannot give you a ring because it cannot be used for personal intentions. It does not belong to you like the gold you gave to the princess to get her. The Kingdom is its owner.
As Prince Faustino said, royalty is not measured by dress. It measures how you take care of your Kingdom, including its wealth.
Prince Marfino, you are the only one who did not use the gold you brought to Tipora. Even when you come home here, there is no discount. However, I hope you understand that the hidden wealth does not grow. Many people need it.
So, I decided that the next king of Calvar would be Prince Tales. The magical ring will also go to him. He is like your father, who wants to help the smallest people in the Kingdom.
Prince Tales also did not hesitate to help the poor in the other Kingdom. You know that the wealth provided.</h2><br />

                            11. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.
