                    <p>What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

ENTERTAIN, PERSUADE,INFORM,OR DESCRIBE1. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns related to the costs created by illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are alreadyhere; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries who compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers,2. All toilet flush tanks work about the same. When the toilet is flushed, the trip handle lifts the tank ball, opening the outlet and letting water flow into the bowl. When the tank is nearly empty, the ball falls back in place over the outlet. The float falls with the water level, opening the water-supply inlet valve just as the outlet is being closed, and the tank is refilled through the filler tube. Water also flows through the bowl refill tube into the overflow pipe to replenish trap-sealing water. As the water level in the tank nears the top of the overflow pipe, the float closes the inlet valve, completing the cycle.3. It's been almost ten years since I first ran for political office. I was thirty-five at the time, four years out of law school, recently married, and generally impatient with life. A seat in the Illinois legislature had opened up, and several friends suggested that I run, thinking that my work as a civil rights lawyer, and contacts from my days as a community organizer, would make me a viable candidate. After discussing it with my wife, I entered the race and proceeded to do what every first-time candidate does: I talked to anyone who would listen. I went to block club meetings and church socials, beauty shops and barbershops. If two guys were standing on a corner, I would cross the street to hand them campaign literature. And everywhere I went, I'd get some version of the same two questions.4. Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.​</a>

                            1. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

When the tank is nearly empty, the ball falls back in place over the outlet.

As the water level in the tank nears the top of the overflow pipe, the float closes the inlet valve, completing the cycle.3. It's been almost ten years since I first ran for political office.

There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.​</h2><br />
