                                            1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through yourthoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences athome, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solvingand decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advicethat your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration notonly on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges,you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions andreflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help yousucceed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearnand re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experienceto another3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details ofwhat you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review isa very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives youthe opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so,in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you havelearned to any academic or personal challenges​​</a>

Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</a>

                            8. 1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through yourthoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences athome, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solvingand decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advicethat your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration notonly on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges,you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions andreflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help yousucceed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearnand re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experienceto another3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details ofwhat you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review isa very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives youthe opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it.
