                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fact that people care about an issue is of course important in a democracy – no politician will last long if they ignore public opinion. However, this can mean important matters which don’t get much public attention may be neglected, leading to big problems later.</p><p></p><p>One cause of this selective public attention is availability bias: the tendency to think an issue is important because it comes to mind easily. An example is a person thinking that plane journeys, but not car trips, are dangerous because they have seen airplane crashes in the news. In contrast, car crashes are routine enough that they do not attract much media coverage, and so examples of them do not come to mind as quickly.</p><p></p><p>One example of the impact of availability bias is the number of additional Americans who died in road accidents by switching from flying to driving after 11 September 2001, which exceeded the number who died in the attacks after just three months.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> IT</strong><strong> HELPS</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />
