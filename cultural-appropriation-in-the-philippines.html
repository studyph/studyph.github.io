                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Use "Filipino" instead of "Philippine" or "Pilipino": The term "Filipino" is the preferred term when referring to the people and the culture of the Philippines. The term "Philippine" is often associated with government or official contexts, while "Pilipino" is an outdated term that was used during the Marcos regime.</p><p></p><p>2. Use "Bayanihan" instead of "Community Service": Bayanihan is a traditional Filipino concept of community unity and cooperation to achieve a common goal. It is a term that resonates with many Filipinos and reflects the country's culture of helping each other. Using the term "Bayanihan" instead of "community service" is more culturally appropriate and respectful.</p><p></p><p>3. Use "Indigenous Peoples" instead of "Tribal Groups": In the Philippine context, the term "Indigenous Peoples" is used to refer to the various ethnic groups who have been living in the country long before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers. The term "tribal groups" is considered outdated and sometimes carries a negative connotation. Using "Indigenous Peoples" shows respect for the diversity and cultural heritage of these groups.</p><br />
