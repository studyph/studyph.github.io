                        <p>In this day and age, more and more people are turning to technology for comfort and support. With this comes the need to be aware of the dangers of cyberbullying.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying is defined as an intentional act of online aggression. This can include sending hateful messages, spreading rumors, or sharing sensitive information about a person. It can occur in an instant through a wide variety of platforms, whether it be social media, forums, or even instant messaging. </p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying is a form of harassment, and it can make its victims feel isolated and scared, making them reluctant to even seek help or talk to anyone. The effects of cyberbullying can be devastating, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide in some cases. </p><p></p><p>This story takes place in a quiet, small town. Nicole, a 17 year old high school student, had been a victim of cyberbullying for quite some time. She never saw it coming.</p><p></p><p>One day, a malicious rumor was spread about her, saying that she had an affair with her teacher. Everyone in her school read the post and Nicole soon became the talk of the town. Everyone was throwing hateful comments and insults at her and Nicole quickly began to feel overwhelmed and scared.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know who had posted the malicious rumor and was left feeling helpless and alone. She didn't want to talk to anyone about it, she just wanted to hide in her room and never come out.</p><p></p><p>However, one person eventually came to her rescue. Her best friend, Matthew, showed up at her doorstep with a bouquet of flowers and a casserole. He had heard about the cyberbulling, and had spent all day cooking her food and picking her flowers to remind her of the kind, compassionate people in the world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his genuine display of love and support broke Nicole out of her despair and she finally opened up to him about her experience. With his help, she was able to confront the bullies, put an end to their taunts, and seek professional help.</p><p></p><p>This story reminds us that even in moments of darkness, hope and compassion can be found in the most unexpected places. Cyberbulling is an alarming issue that can have devastating consequences, but with the support of friends and family, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p></p><p>(Hope this helps!)</p><br />

She cried after hearing that, she said that she's being bullied because she doesn't have any friends at school. I advise her to watch a video and it helps her a lot. We go to school together and I'm happy that she became confident and cheerful. I want to stop bullying and I'm happy that I helped a teenager like me to stop bullying without using her fists. </p><p></p><p>https://www.jw.org/finder?srcid=share&amp;wtlocale=E&amp;lank=docid-502013189_1_VIDEO</p><p> </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Any kind of bullying should not be allowed. It can cause depression in people especially in a teenager like me. Because nowadays many teenagers are still weak, I mean they will quickly embrace the words they will receive. Bullying is also a judgment on someone which is wrong. Everyone has no right to judge, only God. Especially cyber bullying if we notice now that many people use social media with just one click and that's it. Especially if the true story of the person is not yet known. That is what causes depression that can lead to suicide.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>That's just my opinion :&gt;</p>Bullying and cyber bullying are two major problems that young teens and adults have. These two things are not the same, but they do in fact intersect one another. Lots of people are committing suicide every year just because of this problem. It starts online then it can lead to neighborhoods or even at your own house. An important key to know if you’re being bullied, is to talk to someone about it, don’t keep it to yourself.<br />

Sarah was different from the other students because she had superpowers. She could fly, become invisible, and had super strength. Despite her powers, Sarah was often the target of bullies. They would taunt her and make fun of her for being different.</p><p></p><p>One day, Sarah had had enough. She decided that she was going to use her powers to stand up to the bullies and put an end to their cruel behavior. The next time a group of bullies confronted her, Sarah flew up into the air and became invisible. The bullies were confused and didn't know what was happening. Suddenly, they felt a strong force push them back, and they fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Sarah revealed herself and stood in front of the bullies. She told them that their behavior was unacceptable and that they needed to stop bullying others. The bullies were shocked by Sarah's bravery and didn't know what to do. They apologized for their actions and promised to change their ways.</p><p></p><p>From that day forward, Sarah became known as a hero at her school. She used her powers to help others who were being bullied and stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. The school became a safer place for everyone, and Sarah's bravery inspired others to speak out against bullying.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Sarah learned that being different was something to be proud of, and that standing up for what is right is always worth it.</p><p></p><br />

It is difficult to deal with because sometimes you are afraid to confront them. Someone who experiences bullying doesn't usually show their emotions to someone or tell someone that they are being bullied because they feel anxious. People who are being bullied can experience depression and some people who experience this commits suicide. Therefore, in order for these things to not happen, we should keep our opinions to ourselves because we never know that just by our words even if we meant it as a joke, are taken seriously by other people.</p><br />
