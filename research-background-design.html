Which people? What kind of effects? The second question defines its concepts more clearly. It is researchable through qualitative and quantitative data collection.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>2. ×Why is there a housing crisis in the Netherlands?</p><p>   √What impact have university internationalisation policies had on the availability and affordability of housing in the Netherlands?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Starting with “why” often means that your question is not focused enough: there are too many possible answers and no clear starting point for research. By targeting just one aspect of the problem and using more specific terms, the second question offers a clear path to finding an answer.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>3. ×Does the US or the UK have a better healthcare system?</p><p>   √How do the US and the UK compare in health outcomes and patient satisfaction among low-income people with chronic illnesses?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is too broad and overly subjective: there’s no clear criteria for what counts as “better”. The second question is much more researchable. It uses clearly defined terms and narrows its focus to a specific population.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>4. ×What should political parties do about low voter turnout in region X?</p><p>   √What are the most effective communication strategies for increasing voter turnout among under-30s in region X?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>It is generally not feasible for academic research to answer broad questions about “what should be done”. The second question is more specific, and aims to gain an understanding of possible solutions in order to make informed recommendations.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>5. ×Has there been an increase in homelessness in San Francisco in the past ten years?</p><p>  √How have economic, political and social factors affected patterns of homelessness in San Francisco over the past ten years?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is too simple: it can be answered with a simple yes or no. The second question is more complex, requiring in-depth investigation and the development of an original argument.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>6. ×What factors led to women gaining the right to vote in the UK in 1918?</p><p>  √How did Irish women perceive and relate to the British women’s suffrage movement?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is too broad and not very original. It has been extensively researched by historians, and it would be very difficult to contribute new knowledge. The second question identifies an underexplored aspect of the topic that requires investigation and discussion of various primary and secondary sources to answer.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>7. ×How can sexual health services and LGBT support services in district X be improved?</p><p>  √How can sexual health clinics in district X develop their services and communications to be more LGBT-inclusive?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is not focused enough: it tries to address two different practical problems (the quality of sexual health services and LGBT support services). Even though the two issues are related, it’s not clear how the research will bring them together. The second integrates the two problems into one focused, specific question.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>8. ×Where do the majority of immigrants to Germany come from?</p><p>  √What are the similarities and differences in the experiences of recent Turkish, Polish and Syrian immigrants in Berlin?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is too simple, asking for a straightforward fact that can be easily found online. The second is a more complex comparative question that requires data collection and detailed discussion to answer.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>9. ×How is race represented in Shakespeare’s Othello?</p><p>  √How have modern adaptations of Shakespeare’s Othello dealt with the theme of racism through casting, staging and allusion to contemporary events?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question is not original or relevant — it has been answered so many times that it would be very difficult to contribute anything new. The second question takes a specific angle with scope to make an original argument, and has more relevance to current social concerns and debates.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>10. ×How can drunk driving be prevented?</p><p>   √What effect do different legal approaches have on the number of people who drive after drinking in European countries?</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The first question asks for a ready-made solution, and is not focused or researchable. The second question is a clearer comparative question, but note that it may not be practically feasible. For a smaller research project or thesis, it could be narrowed down further to focus on the effectiveness of drunk driving laws in just one or two countries.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>huhuhu..kakapagod</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Step 1: Question / questioning</p><p>The first of the steps of the scientific method consists of the question, in the initial approach of the question. This step is critical because it allows us to start the process and determine where it will go.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the researcher in question will pose a question, a question, with the aim of solving it through the following 5 steps. They are usually questions related to observations already made, that is to say, they are not “random” questions that one can just think of. These questions are usually of the following type: What, Why, How, When, etc.</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Observation</p><p>The second step of the scientific method is observation. It consists of the first making contact with reality that we want to study. Observing implies “actively acquiring information through sight”.</p><p></p><p>Observation also includes looking at the details of what we are studying, analysing the causes and consequences of the events. However, its main objective is to gather as much information as possible in relation to the initial question raised in step 1. This observation, moreover, must be intentional, that is, focused on seeking results.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, the information transcribed through observation must be accurate, verifiable and measurable.</p><p></p><p>Step 3: formulating the hypothesis</p><p>After observing the object of study and gathering information on the question initially raised, we will proceed to develop step 3 of the 6 steps of the scientific method: the formulation of a (or more) hypothesis. This hypothesis, logically, will have to do with the initial question, i.e. it will attempt to answer that question/question.</p><p></p><p>Scientific method-Diagram</p><p>Explanatory diagram of the steps of the scientific method.</p><p>But what exactly is a hypothesis? It consists of a formulation generally affirmative, that is used to predict an outcome. From this, the research or experiment in question can be initiated, which will have the purpose of deducing if this affirmation is real or not.</p><p></p><p>If it is false, we can reformulate the initial hypothesis into a new one, changing data or characteristics. In other words, the hypothesis is intended to be proven; it can be real (affirmative) or not (null), in the event that it is refuted.</p><p></p><p>Step 4: Experimentation</p><p>The next step in the scientific method is experimentation, that is, the testing of the hypothesis on the basis of an experiment. That is to say, it implies taking to the practical field the previous steps (initial question, hypothesis…), studying the phenomenon in question (which is usually reproduced in a laboratory through artificial and experimental techniques).</p><p></p><p>In addition, through experimentation the necessary and/or interesting conditions are created to replicate and study a specific phenomenon.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Through experimentation, the results are obtained. Specifically, and broadly speaking, we can find results of three types: results that contradict the initial hypothesis; results that reaffirm the initial hypothesis; and results that do not provide any conclusion or data relevant to our hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Generally, in the first case, the hypothesis is questioned; in the second, the hypothesis is confirmed (it is considered correct, although revisions can be made); and in the third, research continues in order to find possible results.</p><p></p><p>There are different types of experimentation; one of the most commonly used methods is hypothesis contrasting.</p><p></p><p>Step 5: Data analysis</p><p>Once the data have been obtained, they are analysed, which configures step 5 of the 6 steps of the scientific method. Data generally consist of numbers, “presence” or “absence” responses, “yes” or “no” responses, and so on, it all depends on the type of experiment and the assessment or observation scales used.</p><p></p><p>It’s important write down all the data we have at our disposalincluding those we did not expect or initially believe to be irrelevant to the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The results or data obtained can essentially be of three types: results that refute the initial hypothesis, that confirm it or that do not provide sufficient information to allow us to refute or confirm the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Step 6: Accept or reject the initial hypothesis</p><p>The last of the 6 steps of the scientific method involves accepting or refuting (reject) the initial hypothesis. In other words, it is intended to answer the initial question raised in step 1.</p><p></p><p>The conclusions reached are based on an informal or statistical analysis. In the first case (informal), we must ask ourselves: Do the data obtained reinforce our hypothesis? In the second case (statistical) we must establish a numerical degree of “acceptance” or “rejection” of the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Technically, the scientific method ends in step 6; however, it is also true that additional steps can be added, depending on the characteristics of our research.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. ×What effect does social media have on people’s minds?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>  √What effect does daily use of Twitter have on the attention span of under-16s?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The first question is not specific enough: what type of social media? Which people? What kind of effects? The second question defines its concepts more clearly. It is researchable through qualitative and quantitative data collection.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. ×Why is there a housing crisis in the Netherlands?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>   √What impact have university internationalisation policies had on the availability and affordability of housing in the Netherlands?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Starting with “why” often means that your question is not focused enough: there are too many possible answers and no clear starting point for research. By targeting just one aspect of the problem and using more specific terms, the second question offers a clear path to finding an answer.

</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. ×Does the US or the UK have a better healthcare system?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>   √How do the US and the UK compare in health outcomes and patient satisfaction among low-income people with chronic illnesses?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The first question is too broad and overly subjective: there’s no clear criteria for what counts as “better”. The second question is much more researchable. It uses clearly defined terms and narrows its focus to a specific population.

</strong></p><p><strong>4. ×What should political parties do about low voter turnout in region X?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>   √What are the most effective communication strategies for increasing voter turnout among under-30s in region X?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It is generally not feasible for academic research to answer broad questions about “what should be done”. The second question is more specific, and aims to gain an understanding of possible solutions in order to make informed recommendations.
</strong></p><p><strong>

</strong></p><p><strong>  √How have economic, political and social factors affected patterns of homelessness in San Francisco over the past ten years?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:

</strong></p><p><strong>  √How can sexual health clinics in district X develop their services and communications to be more LGBT-inclusive?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
