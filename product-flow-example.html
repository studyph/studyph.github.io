What is Factoring?2.Describe Common Monomial Factor.3.How can we obtain the CMF? Answer:1.In mathematics, factorization or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind. For example, 3 × 5 is a factorization of the integer 15, and is a factorization of the polynomial x² – 4.2. A common monomial factor is a monomial that is a common factor to all of the terms of a polynomial.3. Calculating Chaikin Money Flow. Money flow multiplier. The first step is to determine each period's money flow multiplier as follows: Money flow volume. The next step is to calculate the volume of money flow by multiplying the volume for the period by the money flow multiplier obtained in step one. CMF.​</a>

1. A contingency Plan is a written emergency procedure used to minimize hazards from fires, explosions, 
or unplanned releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or water.
2. The process flow of Waste Management refers to the 4Rs namely, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and 
Recover.
3. Hazardous wastes can be broken down (decomposed) into their constituent elements by bacteria and 
other microorganisms.
4. Human and animal wastes are example of non-biodegradable waste.
5. Recycle is the process of using materials/waste to make new products.</a>

Answer:1.In mathematics, factorization or factoring consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind. For example, 3 × 5 is a factorization of the integer 15, and is a factorization of the polynomial x² – 4.2. A common monomial factor is a monomial that is a common factor to all of the terms of a polynomial.3. Calculating Chaikin Money Flow. Money flow multiplier. The first step is to determine each period's money flow multiplier as follows: Money flow volume.
