There are countless ways to incorporate word parts into your lesson plans. You may already have a structured plan in place, or you might be testing the waters. Either way, teach your students to be word detectives.  A word detective looks at all the clues to determine a word’s meaning. When students know how to decode large words by identifying root words and affixes, they will be sufficiently prepared to tackle higher level texts. </p><p>The table below lists 120 commonly used Greek and Latin root words, prefixes, and suffixes.  It also includes the meaning of each word part and several example words. It’s a great place to start if you’re interested in adding a regularly scheduled word parts practice to your daily teaching agenda. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Activity 1: Do Math To Match Understanding the following words will help you as you read the story of Perseus.
