If we are related to all other species on the planet, art we justified in treating the environment as a mere natural resource for food or building houses and buildings? 2. The theory of evolution describes a gradual development and progression of life on Earth, contrary to the biblical idea that all life on earth was created in six days. Which explanation is more acceptable to you? How do you reconcile this with what the Bible says? 3. What do you think is the role of humans in the extinction of other species?

                                            REALISM  The Renaissance artists sought to create realistic artworks Humans were drown with facial expressions and were lifelike Humans and the divine were not depicted differently from each other Backgrounds in paintings made use of nature Artists placed subjects in their natural settings to give a sense of familiarity and realness to their work This need for realism helped the Italian artist Filippo Brunelleschi develop a linear perspective Linear perspective allows artists to draw figures in three dimensions on a two-dimensional medium. By following the rules of linear perspective, artists could draw objects proportionately to the other elements in the composition. This mastery of perspective brought a depth of realism never seen in art before. Linear perspective gives an illusion of depth to an artwork Objects that are near the viewer are bigger compared to objects that are farther away Italian Renaissance artists often placed their subjects in large or outdoor spaces like courtyards and forests, making the paintings feel spacious and large.parang awa na ninyo need ko po ng explanation dito need ko real na explanation ​</a>

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

                                            Bees are exposed to many hardships and many dangers. Winds and storms prove as disastrous to them as to other navigators. Black spiders lie in wait for them, as do brigands for travelers. One day, as I was looking for a bee in some goldenrod. I spied one partly concealed under a leaf. Its baskets were full of pollen, and it did not move. On lifting the leaf, I discovered that a hairy spider was hidden there and had the bee by the throat. The killer was evidently afraid of the bee’s sting and was holding it by the throat till quite sure of its death. Vergil speaks of the painted lizard, perhaps a species of salamander, as an enemy of the honey-bee. We have no lizard that destroys bees; but our tree toad, ambushed among the apple and cherry blossoms, snaps them up wholesale. Quick as lightning, that subtle but clammy tongue darts forth and the unsuspecting bee is gone. Vergil also accuses the titmouse and the woodpecker of preying upon the bees. Our kingbird has been charged with a like crime, but he devours only the drones. Either the workers are too small and quick for him, or else he dreads their sting.1.

Flora means "flower" in Latin, and Flora was the Roman goddess of spring and flowering plants, especially wildflowers and plants not raised for food.</p><p>2. Fauna comes from the name Fauna, a Roman goddess of earth and fertility, the Roman god Faunus, and the related forest spirits called Fauns. All three words are cognates of the name of the Greek god Pan, and panis is the Greek equivalent of fauna.</p><p>3. Music can raise someone's mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed. Music also - and this is important - allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives. The possibilities are endless.</p><p>4. Dance can signify joy, celebration, and/or possession by a higher power, be it good or evil. The act of dancing is also linked with rhythm and transforming time into motion.</p><p>5.

                            16. REALISM  The Renaissance artists sought to create realistic artworks Humans were drown with facial expressions and were lifelike Humans and the divine were not depicted differently from each other Backgrounds in paintings made use of nature Artists placed subjects in their natural settings to give a sense of familiarity and realness to their work This need for realism helped the Italian artist Filippo Brunelleschi develop a linear perspective Linear perspective allows artists to draw figures in three dimensions on a two-dimensional medium. By following the rules of linear perspective, artists could draw objects proportionately to the other elements in the composition. This mastery of perspective brought a depth of realism never seen in art before. Linear perspective gives an illusion of depth to an artwork Objects that are near the viewer are bigger compared to objects that are farther away Italian Renaissance artists often placed their subjects in large or outdoor spaces like courtyards and forests, making the paintings feel spacious and large.parang awa na ninyo need ko po ng explanation dito need ko real na explanation ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This  emphasis on realism in Renaissance art was based on the belief that all of nature, both the physical and the spiritual, could be depicted accurately. This period of art featured lifelike representations of humans and the environment, along with accurate perspectives, proportions and shapes. The use of linear perspective allowed the Renaissance artist to draw objects that appeared three dimensional on a two dimensional canvas. In each work, the placement of items and people in a scene were carefully thought out and presented in a realistic manner. Our appreciation and understanding of the natural beauty of the world can be seen in the Renaissance period of art, where detail, composition and our perception of nature blended to create breathtaking pictures that remain timeless to this day.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Realism is an artistic style that emerged during the Renaissance in Italy, the period of history known for its focus on the humanistic values of individualism and human worth. During this time, artists wanted to create art that showed more lifelike features, rather than the traditional, stylized figures of the medieval time period. In doing so, Renaissance artists focused on depicting people with facial expressions, making them appear human and life-like in nature. Additionally, Renaissance painters began incorporating divine figures into their works that looked no different from their human predecessors. These artistic decisions helped establish the importance of realism in painting that lasts to this day.</p><p></p><p>In order to increase the realism of their paintings, Renaissance painters began incorporating natural settings into their works. This meant including backgrounds featuring real, tangible elements like trees, shrubbery and rolling hills. This helped create a sense of familiarity and reality because viewers were able to recognize these elements in their everyday lives. The need for realism was further aided by the adoption of linear perspective. This system used lines and vanishing points to give an illusion of depth to an artwork. Objects that were nearer to the viewer appeared larger in comparison to those farther away, and often artists included large or outdoor spaces in their works to further enhance the sense of space and depth. Together, these innovations helped artists achieve the high levels of realism that has come to characterize the Renaissance.</p><br />

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

                            18. Bees are exposed to many hardships and many dangers. Winds and storms prove as disastrous to them as to other navigators. Black spiders lie in wait for them, as do brigands for travelers. One day, as I was looking for a bee in some goldenrod. I spied one partly concealed under a leaf. Its baskets were full of pollen, and it did not move. On lifting the leaf, I discovered that a hairy spider was hidden there and had the bee by the throat. The killer was evidently afraid of the bee’s sting and was holding it by the throat till quite sure of its death. Vergil speaks of the painted lizard, perhaps a species of salamander, as an enemy of the honey-bee. We have no lizard that destroys bees; but our tree toad, ambushed among the apple and cherry blossoms, snaps them up wholesale. Quick as lightning, that subtle but clammy tongue darts forth and the unsuspecting bee is gone. Vergil also accuses the titmouse and the woodpecker of preying upon the bees. Our kingbird has been charged with a like crime, but he devours only the drones. Either the workers are too small and quick for him, or else he dreads their sting.1.
