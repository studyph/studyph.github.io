                                            C. Directions: Summarize the story. The Ant and the Dove One hot summer day, a thirsty ant was searching for water. The ant walked along, until reaching the river. She climbed up on a small rock, to drink the water. But she slipped and fell into the river. A dove was sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She looked up to the tree and thanked the dove. Later, a bird catcher nearby was about to throw his net over the dove hoping to trap it. An ant saw him and guessed what he was about to do. The dove was resting and he had no idea about the bird catcher. An ant quickly bit him on the foot. Feeling the pain, the bird catcher dropped his net and let out a light scream. The dove noticed it and quickly flew away.​</a>
