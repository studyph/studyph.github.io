                                            News develops every day. The beauty of the newspaper in the classroom is that it is also fresh each day. It comes to you with the latest news and information and, unlike other media, comes beautifully written with lots of detail. Stories unfold as reporters unearth more information to reconstruct what happened. There is truly no better record of the world's happenings than a newspaper.For teachers the newspaper offers a special attraction. It has been called the living textbook and it lives up to that name. The newspaper can be used to enhance skills in reading, writing, listening, speaking, math, social studies and science. Critical thinking is the natural outgrowth of using a newspaper to learn. Unlike textbooks, which are several years outdated by the time they get into students' hands, the newspaper comes alive with information. The newspaper expands the curriculum with an unlimited amount of information to use as background for learning activities.These activities will help students improve their skills in reading and writing. These skills are among the ones they will practice: how to find the main idea, how to increase vocabulary, how to compare readings, how to form sentences, how to ask a good question and how to write a great summary. They will employ many critical thinking skills as they are required to interact with the authentic material found in the newspaper​</a>

                                            I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

Our country took pride of ApolinarioMabini, a polio victim and yet he became the "Brain" of Katipunan. In these modern times we have a good example from the Bicol Region. He is Eduardo Camela, a fifteen- year-old student of Daet Parochial School in Camarines Norte. Despite his physical defect caused by polio, he has invented four useful things. His latest invention, the Camela Coco-Cell won for him a gold medal from the president and P1,500 in cash at the National Science Fair held by the Department of Science and Technology. He was affected by polio at the age of 3. He is also a very talented painter. He truly exemplifies the proud and talented Filipino. QUESTIONS: 1. Who are the physically handicapped people who showed success in the story? 2. What made them physically handicapped? 3. What was the contribution of ApolinarioMabini in our history? 4. How did Eduardo Camela show his talents? 5. What recognition did Eduardo receive? 6. What made them successful? Explain your answer.​</a>

                            2. Solve the following problems: 1) Out of the 45 books in the bookshelves, 18 are mathematics books, 10 are science books, 9 are history books and 8 are story books. If you pick one book at random, what is the probability that it is a science or mathematics book? 2) In a particular class, 78% of the students have a smartphone, 38% have a smartphone and a tablet, and 3 % have neither a smartphone nor a tablet. Find the probability that a randomly selected student has a a) tablet? b) tablet or a smartphone? c) smartphone but does not have a tablet? 3) In a junior high school completing class of 510 students, 110 are on the Science, Technology and Engineering (STE) Program.

The probability of picking a mathematics book is 18/45 = 2/5. The probability of picking a science book is 10/45 = 2/9.</p><p>To find the probability of picking a science or mathematics book, we add the probabilities of picking a mathematics book and a science book and subtract the probability of picking a book that is both a mathematics and a science book (which is 0):</p><p></p><p>P(science or mathematics book) = P(mathematics book) + P(science book) - P(mathematics and science book)</p><p>= 2/5 + 2/9 - 0</p><p>= 28/45</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the probability of picking a science or mathematics book is 28/45.</p><p></p><p>2.) Let S and T be the events that a student has a smartphone and a tablet, respectively. Then, the probability of a student having a smartphone is 78/100 = 39/50, and the probability of a student having neither a smartphone nor a tablet is 3/100.</p><p>a) The probability of a student having a tablet is P(T) = P(S and T) + P(not S and T).

Let S be the event that a student is in the STE program, and T be the event that a student will take the advanced mathematics course.

                            16. News develops every day. The beauty of the newspaper in the classroom is that it is also fresh each day. It comes to you with the latest news and information and, unlike other media, comes beautifully written with lots of detail. Stories unfold as reporters unearth more information to reconstruct what happened. There is truly no better record of the world's happenings than a newspaper.For teachers the newspaper offers a special attraction. It has been called the living textbook and it lives up to that name. The newspaper can be used to enhance skills in reading, writing, listening, speaking, math, social studies and science. Critical thinking is the natural outgrowth of using a newspaper to learn. Unlike textbooks, which are several years outdated by the time they get into students' hands, the newspaper comes alive with information. The newspaper expands the curriculum with an unlimited amount of information to use as background for learning activities.These activities will help students improve their skills in reading and writing. These skills are among the ones they will practice: how to find the main idea, how to increase vocabulary, how to compare readings, how to form sentences, how to ask a good question and how to write a great summary. They will employ many critical thinking skills as they are required to interact with the authentic material found in the newspaper​</h2><br />

                            21. I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

After leaving the heart, the red blood cell travels through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. There it picks up oxygen making the deoxygenated red blood cell now an oxygenated blood cell. The blood cell then makes it way back to the heart via the pulmonary vein into the left atrium.</p><p></p><p>Once blood travels through the pulmonic valve, it enters your lungs. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale. Once the blood is purified and oxygenated, it travels back to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sa 2a. at 2b. kailangan po kau ang sumagot kasi po ti test po nyan kung may natutunan po kau sa lesson..kasi yung magiging sagot po niyo riyan ay base sa understanding nyo po sa lesson..kaya niyo po yan..</p><p>SANA MAKATULONG PA RIN PO YUNG ANSWER KO.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
