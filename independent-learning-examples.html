Use the values in Learning Task 1.Guidelines for Constructing a Data Table1. Make a table of vertical columns for the variables. Record the independent variable (N) in the first column, the dependent variable (DV) in the second; reserve the third for any derived quantity (average or percentage).2. Now subdivide and label the DV column to provide space for each of the trials.3. Record the IV, then the data (DV) results that correspond to the level of each IV.4. Calculate the derived quantities (average or percentage) and enter the values into the table.5. Clearly state the purpose of the experiment by making a title (example: The IV on DV or The effect of= IV) on \ (DV) whichever seems appropriate.(Title)Question: How would you compare data presentation in Learning Task 3 vs Learning Task 1?*Please see attached rubric on how this activity will be given score.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer: SIMPLE PAST TENSE OF VERB; Typically, you would form the past tense as follows: Take the root form of the verb (the one you will find in our amazing dictionary) and add –ed to the end. If the verb ends in -e, you would just add a -d. For example, the simple past tense of look is looked, and the simple past tense of ignite is ignited.</strong></p><p>  PAST PERPECT TENSE OF VERB; The past perfect tense is formed by using the word had followed by the past participle of the verb. For regular verbs, the past participle is a form of the verb that ends in -ed or -d. For example, the past participle of watch is watched</p><p>THIS IS THE DEFFERENCE; These two tenses are both used to talk about things that happened in the past. However we use past perfect to talk about something that happened before another action in the past, which is usually expressed by the past simple.</p><p><strong>Explanation:SANA PO MAKA TULONG</strong></p><p></p><br />
