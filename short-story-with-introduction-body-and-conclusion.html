It consists of one or two pages of written critique that will succinctly discuss your idea, realization, or concept regarding a literary selection. The point here is to introduce your idea or discovery about a literary selection Tips in Writing Short Paper 1. Choose a literary selection that you want to analyse. 2. Always begin with an outline. 3. Start with a joke, an anecdote, or a quotation from the literary text as your introduction.(The idea is to hook your readers so that they will be more willing to listen to your idea). 4. The body of your essay must try to discuss the relation of your idea with the literary text.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>It was a hot summer day in the small town of Millfield. The sun was beating down on the streets, and the only respite from the heat was the shade of the tall trees that lined the roads. In the midst of this heat, a young boy named Tom was walking down the street, looking for something to do.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>As Tom walked, he saw a small crowd gathered outside a house. Curious, he made his way over to see what was going on. As he got closer, he could hear the sound of music coming from inside the house. Intrigued, Tom pushed his way through the crowd and stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>Inside, he found a group of people gathered around a man playing an old guitar. The man had a long beard and was dressed in tattered clothes. His voice was rough and gravelly, but there was something about his music that drew Tom in.</p><p></p><p>As the man played, Tom felt a sense of peace wash over him. He closed his eyes and let the music take him away. When he opened his eyes again, he saw that the other people in the room were swaying to the music, lost in their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>When the song was over, the man put down his guitar and looked around the room. "Thank you all for listening," he said. "I hope my music has brought you some joy."</p><p></p><p>Tom approached the man and asked him about his music. The man introduced himself as Jack and told Tom that he had been a musician for many years. He had played in big cities and small towns alike, and he loved nothing more than bringing people together with his music.</p><p></p><p>Jack and Tom struck up a conversation, and before long, Tom was asking him to teach him how to play the guitar. Jack agreed, and over the next few weeks, Tom spent every spare moment practicing with Jack.</p><p></p><p>As the summer came to a close, Tom had become a skilled guitarist. He played for his family and friends, and he even started playing at local events. But he never forgot the man who had taught him everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>One day, Tom went back to the house where he had first met Jack. But when he knocked on the door, there was no answer.

                            30. What I Can Do Your task is to write a critical review of a myth or story found in your gion or hometown. It may be written in English or in other languages. Your review must be one to two pages long, double-spaced, and with a proper title. Writing Short Paper A short paper is literally "short. It consists of one or two pages of written critique that will succinctly discuss your idea, realization, or concept regarding a literary selection. The point here is to introduce your idea or discovery about a literary selection Tips in Writing Short Paper 1. Choose a literary selection that you want to analyse. 2. Always begin with an outline. 3. Start with a joke, an anecdote, or a quotation from the literary text as your introduction.(The idea is to hook your readers so that they will be more willing to listen to your idea). 4. The body of your essay must try to discuss the relation of your idea with the literary text. The conclusion is just like any conclusion when you are writing an essay- summarize what you have said or discussed in the body in two to three sentences.​</h2><br />
