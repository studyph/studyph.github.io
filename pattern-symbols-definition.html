Instructions: Put a heart symbol on the space provided if the statement is true and asterisk (*) if it is false. _________1. The purpose of narration is to define a concept or a term. 2. In defining, the essay explores the problem and suggests solution. 3. Signal words like classified as and another kind are under description. 4. Then, Next, and Finally are the signal words that can be used in classification. 5. Comparison and contrast focus on the similarities and differences of people, things, and ideas. 6. Transitional devices like however, on the other hand, but, and although can be used in comparing. 7. When looking for the reasons why earthquake happens in an essay, one may use the cause-effect pattern. 8. The purpose of description is to create a picture mentally so that readers can visualize what is being described. 9. In defining terms or concepts, writers may go beyond the technical definition of the term on how they understand the terms. 10. When using definition as pattern of development in writing, the signal words to use are: the term means, is defined as, and for instance.​</a>

                                            Looking Back at your LessonFrom your previous lesson, you have learned that a sequence is a set of numbers written in a special order by the application of a definite rule. Each number in the sequence is called term. To look for some pattern or rules will help us to continue a given sequence of numbers, figures, or to fill in the missing numbers or symbols. And to formulate the rule in finding the nth term of a sequence, we can look for a pattern, guess and check, or working backwards. You have learned also the difference between equation and expression. Recall that anequation is a statement tells about the equality between two quantities while expression is composed of different variables and constant and it is only one parts of an equation.Determine if each is an expression or an equation.1.)

Culture was defined using16classic definition, it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, andinteract with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, ritualscelebrations, symbols. language, etc.).

Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions. Family, friends, religion, economy, and mass media are some examples of structures or patterns of our interactions​</a>

                            6. Activity 1. Bring Back the Memories This activity will allow you to recall the important points about patterns of development in writing and identify the features of each pattern of development in paragraph writing. Instructions: Put a heart symbol on the space provided if the statement is true and asterisk (*) if it is false. _________1. The purpose of narration is to define a concept or a term. 2. In defining, the essay explores the problem and suggests solution. 3. Signal words like classified as and another kind are under description. 4. Then, Next, and Finally are the signal words that can be used in classification. 5. Comparison and contrast focus on the similarities and differences of people, things, and ideas. 6. Transitional devices like however, on the other hand, but, and although can be used in comparing. 7. When looking for the reasons why earthquake happens in an essay, one may use the cause-effect pattern. 8. The purpose of description is to create a picture mentally so that readers can visualize what is being described. 9. In defining terms or concepts, writers may go beyond the technical definition of the term on how they understand the terms. 10. When using definition as pattern of development in writing, the signal words to use are: the term means, is defined as, and for instance.​</h2><br />

                            11. Looking Back at your LessonFrom your previous lesson, you have learned that a sequence is a set of numbers written in a special order by the application of a definite rule. Each number in the sequence is called term. To look for some pattern or rules will help us to continue a given sequence of numbers, figures, or to fill in the missing numbers or symbols. And to formulate the rule in finding the nth term of a sequence, we can look for a pattern, guess and check, or working backwards. You have learned also the difference between equation and expression. Recall that anequation is a statement tells about the equality between two quantities while expression is composed of different variables and constant and it is only one parts of an equation.Determine if each is an expression or an equation.1.)

Each number in the sequence is called term. To look for some pattern or rules will help us to continue a given sequence of numbers, figures, or to fill in the missing numbers to formulate the rule in finding the nth term of a sequence, we can look for a pattern, a set of or symbols. And guess and check, or working backwards. You have learned also the difference between equation and expression.

Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions.
