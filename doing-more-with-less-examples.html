Directions:
1. Look at the example picture below. It shows sunlight hitting the Earth.
2. Look at the Sun's ray and see how the angle at which they hit the
Earth's
surface changes at different points along the surface of its curved shape.
3. Answer the questions below.
Same amount of incoming
sunlight at each place
Light hits at an angle and spreads
out more on the ground (cooler)
Light hits more directly and only
spreads out a little on the ground
Equator
Light hits at an angle and spreads
out more on the ground

24h of night
23.5° N (Tropic of Cancer)
23.5 S (Tropic of Capricorn)
66.5S (Antarctic circle)

Questions:
1. Does the equator receive more or less direct light than the poles?
2. Which hemisphere receives more light in the pictures? Why?
3. Which hemisphere in this diagram receives more indirect light? Why?
4. Why do you think it is warmer at the equator than at the poles?</a>

The torso may be squared to the knees and hips,or turned atan angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bentat your elbow. Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more orless stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you're doing the twist!

                                            suggests not to be cheap by purchasing lower-cost items that may depreciate faster but ensuring that all the assets entrusted to your care will be used to their fullest potential. For example, you needed printers for the company. It may be efficient to settle for entry-level printers that cost less but still perform the same job decently. However, you should also consider buying high-end printers that may cost more initially but would last longer in terms of their usage.Question: Do managers need to have both effectiveness and efficiency?​</a>

                        PLAGIARISM
<p><strong>Plagiarism </strong>is made easier with technology and the Internet. Everyone’s written work is available on the world wide web. People just copy and paste whatever they see, and present it as their own work, which is plagiarism by definition. Also because of this, people get less creative. No more need for critical or imaginative thinking.
</p><p>
</p><p>An example is when a student is tasked to make a discussion paper. Students go to their phones or laptops and type in the keywords on the Internet. The student just reads minimally and copy what seems right. There is the copying of a written work -- no thinking nor creativity, imagination, and ingenuity needed.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Plagiarism </strong>is simply the copying of another person’s work and presenting it as your own. <strong>Plagiarism</strong> is illegal under the Intellectual Property Code, a special law, which punishes it with imprisonment and fine. <strong>Plagiarism </strong>is a form of cheating as it puts a person on top without working hard.

                            15. suggests not to be cheap by purchasing lower-cost items that may depreciate faster but ensuring that all the assets entrusted to your care will be used to their fullest potential. For example, you needed printers for the company. It may be efficient to settle for entry-level printers that cost less but still perform the same job decently. However, you should also consider buying high-end printers that may cost more initially but would last longer in terms of their usage.Question: Do managers need to have both effectiveness and efficiency?​</h2><br />
                        <p>That <strong>you need to be both, effective and efficient.</strong> Except, when given a choice, we're likely to choose one over the other.

                        <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is presenting other people's work or ideas as your own, with or without their permission. It is by including it into your work without full acknowledgment from the owner. All<strong> published and unpublished material </strong>in any form is covered under this description. Nowadays, there is available <strong>plagiarism detection software</strong> to identify content resemblance. The <strong>plagiarism software</strong> scans a database of content and identifies its components, then compares it to the content of other work.
</p><p>
</p>UP Student Plagiarizes Prize-winning Photos
<p>These are the answer to the questions about the UP student plagiarizes prize-winning photos:
</p><strong>Mark Joseph Solis </strong>submitted a plagiarized photo at Smiles for the world photo contest headed by Chilean, Ambassador Roberto Mayorga. He is  a UP alumnus who plagiarized award-winning photos from an international photographer named Gregory John Smith
.<p></p>The organizing committee<strong> forfeits the prize money</strong> amounting to  $1000  and asks Solis to pay the round trip tickets expenses to travel in Chile and Brazil.
<p>
</p>Yes, I agree that technology made plagiarism accessible. It is because there is software that can use to download and edit the works of other people. Also, many people are being dishonest to get fame and power by using other people's ideas.<p></p>Types of Plagiarism

3. Discuss why planning is beneficial?
4. What role does, and should, technology play in planning?
5. Will planning become more or less important to managers in the future? Why?
( YOUR OWN ANSWER)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>1.In planning and strategizing my studies, I usually create a study schedule that includes the specific topics or subjects that I need to cover within a given period of time. I also set specific goals for each study session, such as completing a certain number of practice problems or reading a certain number of pages in a textbook. I find that both short-term and long-term planning are effective in carrying out these plans and strategies. Short-term planning helps me stay focused and motivated on a day-to-day basis, while long-term planning allows me to see the bigger picture and stay on track towards my overall academic goals.<br /><br />2.a. I agree with the statement "Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance." Planning is essential in achieving success, whether it be in academics, business, or personal goals. By creating a plan and sticking to it, we can minimize mistakes and maximize efficiency, ultimately leading to better performance.</p><p>b. I disagree with the statement "Managers believe that as long as they work as planned, it is satisfactory." While it is important to follow a plan, simply working as planned does not necessarily mean that the outcome is satisfactory. Managers need to constantly evaluate and adjust their plans to ensure that they are meeting their goals and objectives, and that the outcome is satisfactory.<br /><br />3.Planning is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps individuals and organizations set clear goals and objectives. By having a clear direction, we can better focus our efforts and resources towards achieving those goals. Secondly, planning allows for better decision-making. By considering different options and scenarios in advance, we can make more informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes. Thirdly, planning helps to minimize risk and uncertainty. By anticipating potential problems and having contingency plans in place, we can better handle unexpected situations and adapt to changing circumstances.<br /><br />4.Technology can play a significant role in planning by providing tools and resources to help individuals and organizations create and implement effective plans. For example, project management software can be used to track progress and monitor deadlines, while data analytics tools can be used to identify trends and patterns that can inform future planning. However, it is important to note that technology should be used as a tool to support planning, and not a replacement for human decision-making and critical thinking.<br /><br /><br />5.Planning will continue to be important to managers in the future, as organizations face increasing complexity and uncertainty. Effective planning can help managers navigate these challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. However, the nature of planning may change, as managers may need to consider a wider range of variables and factors, and be more flexible in their approach. Additionally, the role of technology in planning is likely to continue to grow, as new tools and technologies are developed to support planning and decision-making.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
