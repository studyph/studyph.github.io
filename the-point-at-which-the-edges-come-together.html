                                            1. Drawing pencil - this is one of the most important
tools in drawing. It comes in various grades. Proper
to handle is more or less 60 degrees.
 A. Hard pencils – are used where extreme accuracy
 is required especially working on graphs,
 diagrams and charts. H – hard pencils: H, 2H, 3H,
 4H, up to 9H ( the hardest).
 B. Medium pencils – are used for general purpose
 work in drawing. HB &amp; F – between the hard &amp;
 soft.
 C. Soft pencils – are too soft to be used in
 mechanical drafting. They are very useful for art
 work of various kinds.
 B – soft pencils: B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B &amp; 6B ( the
 softest ).
2. Eraser - This is used to clean the dirt off the drawing. A soft eraser is advantageous in removing
smudges and pencil marks, whereas, a harder eraser
is useful for making changes and correcting errors in
the drawing.
3. Erasing Shield - This tool is made up of metal with
irregular holes. It is a useful tool to protect the rest of the
drawing when clearing up smudges, unnecessary pencil
lines and other erasures.
4. Pencil sharpener - will be used whenever they show
sign of dullness. Various types and designs are available in the store for use.
5. Masking tape - This is used for fastening the drawing
paper on the drawing table or drawing board because it
does not damage the board and it will not damage the
paper if it is removed by pulling it off.
6. Drawing paper - Different types of drawing papers
are available for use but hard and soft surface drawing
papers are highly recommended to be the best. This
type does not groove easily when pressure is applied to
the pencil. Oslo paper is commonly used but bond paper is also recommended.
7. T-Square - It is a drawing instrument used when making horizontal lines. It is also used for guiding triangles
when drawing vertical lines. It is made of wood, plastic
or the combination of both. when carrying the T-square. 
There are three (3) types of T-square:
A. Fixed Head. The head is fastened to the
 blade. It is used for ordinary work.
B. Movable Head or Adjustable Head. It has
one
 fixed and one adjustable head and used only
 for occasional drawing.
 C. Detachable Head or Removable Head. It is
 designed for comfort .
8. Triangle - Used to draw vertical &amp; slanting line. It
is usually made of plastic and comes in different
sizes. If in use, the base of the triangle must rest
on the blade of the T-square.
 Commonly used triangles are:
 A. 30 degrees X 60 degrees
 B. 45 degrees X 45 degrees
9. Compass - This drawing instrument is used when
drawing arcs and circles. It is used in a similar
way to a divider. It is composed of one with the
pen leg and the needle point leg being held together with a handle. Hold the handle and draw a
circle.
10. Divider - This is a drawing instrument used when
transferring measurements, dividing lines and
arcs into the desired number of equal parts. It can
easily transfer accurate measurements by adjust-
11. Protractor - It is a semi-circular instrument
divided into 180 equal parts, each of which is
called a degree. It is used to determine
graduations of the degrees when measuring arcs,
angles and circles. High quality protractor is
usually made of plastic.
12. Drawing Board/Table - The vertical edges of the
board and table, which must be straight, are
called working edges since the head of the
 T-Square slides against them. Drawing board
without feet and Drawing table with feet.
13. Paints &amp; Inks - Are used to cover surfaces for
decorative and protective purposes &amp; for writing,
printing, or drawing.
14. Ruler - The most popular type of measuring tool.
It is usually 6 or 12 inches in length.
15. Tape &amp; Tape Ruler - Is a concave, spring-steel
 blade ranging from 1/4" to 1" wide and 6 to about
 300 feet in length, coiled inside a carrying case.
 Metric tape ruler comes in comparable widths and
 lengths up to 10 meters.
16. Drawing Pen - Are generally used for
 calligraphy, making lines and more.
 Style of Speedball
 A. Style A &amp; B - are used for square &amp; round
 Gothic lettering.
 B. Style C - is use for Roman &amp; Text lettering.
 C. Style D - is used for rounded Roman

                            14. 1. Drawing pencil - this is one of the most important
tools in drawing. It comes in various grades. Proper
to handle is more or less 60 degrees.
 A. Hard pencils – are used where extreme accuracy
 is required especially working on graphs,
 diagrams and charts. H – hard pencils: H, 2H, 3H,
 4H, up to 9H ( the hardest).
 B. Medium pencils – are used for general purpose
 work in drawing. HB &amp; F – between the hard &amp;
 soft.
 C. Soft pencils – are too soft to be used in
 mechanical drafting. They are very useful for art
 work of various kinds.
 B – soft pencils: B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B &amp; 6B ( the
 softest ).
2. Eraser - This is used to clean the dirt off the drawing. A soft eraser is advantageous in removing
smudges and pencil marks, whereas, a harder eraser
is useful for making changes and correcting errors in
the drawing.
3. Erasing Shield - This tool is made up of metal with
irregular holes. It is a useful tool to protect the rest of the
drawing when clearing up smudges, unnecessary pencil
lines and other erasures.
4. Pencil sharpener - will be used whenever they show
sign of dullness. Various types and designs are available in the store for use.
5. Masking tape - This is used for fastening the drawing
paper on the drawing table or drawing board because it
does not damage the board and it will not damage the
paper if it is removed by pulling it off.
6. Drawing paper - Different types of drawing papers
are available for use but hard and soft surface drawing
papers are highly recommended to be the best. This
type does not groove easily when pressure is applied to
the pencil. Oslo paper is commonly used but bond paper is also recommended.
7. T-Square - It is a drawing instrument used when making horizontal lines. It is also used for guiding triangles
when drawing vertical lines. It is made of wood, plastic
or the combination of both. when carrying the T-square. 
There are three (3) types of T-square:
A. Fixed Head. The head is fastened to the
 blade. It is used for ordinary work.
B. Movable Head or Adjustable Head. It has
one
 fixed and one adjustable head and used only
 for occasional drawing.
 C. Detachable Head or Removable Head. It is
 designed for comfort .
8. Triangle - Used to draw vertical &amp; slanting line. It
is usually made of plastic and comes in different
sizes. If in use, the base of the triangle must rest
on the blade of the T-square.
 Commonly used triangles are:
 A. 30 degrees X 60 degrees
 B. 45 degrees X 45 degrees
9. Compass - This drawing instrument is used when
drawing arcs and circles. It is used in a similar
way to a divider. It is composed of one with the
pen leg and the needle point leg being held together with a handle. Hold the handle and draw a
circle.
10. Divider - This is a drawing instrument used when
transferring measurements, dividing lines and
arcs into the desired number of equal parts. It can
easily transfer accurate measurements by adjust-
11. Protractor - It is a semi-circular instrument
divided into 180 equal parts, each of which is
called a degree. It is used to determine
graduations of the degrees when measuring arcs,
angles and circles. High quality protractor is
usually made of plastic.
12. Drawing Board/Table - The vertical edges of the
board and table, which must be straight, are
called working edges since the head of the
 T-Square slides against them. Drawing board
without feet and Drawing table with feet.
13. Paints &amp; Inks - Are used to cover surfaces for
decorative and protective purposes &amp; for writing,
printing, or drawing.
14. Ruler - The most popular type of measuring tool.
It is usually 6 or 12 inches in length.
15. Tape &amp; Tape Ruler - Is a concave, spring-steel
 blade ranging from 1/4" to 1" wide and 6 to about
 300 feet in length, coiled inside a carrying case.
 Metric tape ruler comes in comparable widths and
 lengths up to 10 meters.
16. Drawing Pen - Are generally used for
 calligraphy, making lines and more.
 Style of Speedball
 A. Style A &amp; B - are used for square &amp; round
 Gothic lettering.
 B. Style C - is use for Roman &amp; Text lettering.
 C. Style D - is used for rounded Roman
