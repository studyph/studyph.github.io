                            2. What is the relationship between science, technology, and society? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The Connection Between Science, Technology, and Society<p></p><p></p><p></p>Technology alters how we can behave. Society drives technological innovations and scientific inquiry. Science gives us insight into what kind of technologies we could potentially create and how to create them, while technology allows us to conduct further scientific research.<p></p>Science and Technology<p></p>Science informs technological advancements. We rely on theories on physics, material science, electricity, chemistry, etc to develop new technologies. Indeed, we’re still working to create a lot of potentially useful materials that are predicted to exist, based on our current scientific theories, and the more scientific theory develops, the more it can inform our technological advancements. Our ability to create such powerful computers is informed by our science. Quantum computers are being developed, based on our science on the topic, which will further our computing power by orders of magnitude.But technology also changes how we do science. Think about the invention of the telescope. It vastly changed our ability to conduct astronomical research. Space telescopes, probes like Voyager, the Cassini probe and the Huygens lander, etc have done even more. Even more recently, technological advancements have allowed us to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth, which has allowed us to actually photograph a black hole (or really the material around it).I happened to pick astronomy as an example, but the influence technology has had on science is — well — astronomical. Computing power, storage capacity, and so on has allowed for data science and the use of big data in medical sciences, sociology, economics, and more. So the very computers that are being developed, using scientific theory and evidence, also help us do scientific research.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Technology and Society<p></p>In some ways, the influence that technology has had on society is obvious. It’s also very profound. Just consider your ability to ask the Quora community this question, and our ability to answer. It would not exist without technology. Social media, the internet as a whole, blockchain technology, etc all have had significant influences on society.Of course earlier technological revolutions such as the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution cannot be ignored either. The ability to create materials that we use in our everyday life, the ability to feed a massive amount of people, and so on, are all thanks to the development of technological innovations.Of course, while technology has been a great boon for prosperity, it has also had some negative impacts. It has produced quite a bit of pollution, though hopefully technology and science will cure that issue. Probably the worst use of technology — and the science which informs its development — has been weapons of mass destruction.In the opposite direction, society drives technology and sometimes prohibits its development. I recently finished a piece on the ethics of fiction writing, in which I touched on the importance that fiction has had on inspiring new technology and warning of threats that we could face in the future[1]. Society also drives technological evolution through need. Very often a technology emerges because someone recognizes a need for that technology.<p></p>Science and Society<p></p>Just as technology often develops because there is a need for it, science helps solve the needs of society. While a major goal of science is to simply better our understanding, many people leverage science to help solve real world problems in society.The need for a better understanding of epidemics, for instance, drives our research of the topic. Science also improves our understanding of society. Anthropology, sociology, economics, political science, and so on, all help us better understand how society functions. Additionally, like with technology, society can influence our theories, and their evolution. A desire to travel through time, or faster than the speed of light is more than enough to spur on the development of theories that, if correct, would allow such things.Finally, because science alters our understanding of the world, it has had a significant impact on our belief systems, our norms, and our values, as well as our daily behaviors. Germ theory, for instance, has changed our sanitation habits and our hygiene, as well as our food safety protocols. Hand washing is an essential habit that we have primarily because of our understanding of how pathogens spread. And it’s just one of many ways in which scientific theory and evidence has changed our behavior.<p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Science and technology is the very best thing society might ever request for. Since the commercial transformation in the 18 th century science has actually remained in development. Some sectors that have actually been increased by science and technology are energy, physical sciences, details and interaction. The society has actually considerably gotten with the development oftechnology</p><p></p><p>Infrastructure in the society has actually grown with the aid of science andtechnology Modes of transportation like electronic train lines were understood and these really benefited the society by providing them a much better ways of transportation. In the past, nearly whatever was analog however thanks to the science and technology we are now being digitalized every day. The development of the telephone and radio services has actually widened human interaction.</p><p></p><p>Without society then there would be no science and technology and that is why the development of specific tools and devices have actually assisted attain huge things. Society can refrain from doing without the markets we have today. The society requirements science andtechnology The production of computer systems is masterpiece by people was a stone that would come a long method in assisting the society. A computer system assists us to take advantage of ourselves by getting important details that we can utilize to enhance our lives. The effect of science and technology can seriously be acknowledged. Many individuals around the globe consider example scholars in colleges and universities have actually taken the lead taking a look at the relationship between science andtechnology</p><p></p><p>The assessment of this relationship has actually become an essential location of research study. Public interest groups and scholastic companies throughout the world are acknowledging the value of STS.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Science and Technology</p><p>Science informs technological advancements. We rely on theories on physics, material science, electricity, chemistry, etc to develop new technologies. Indeed, we’re still working to create a lot of potentially useful materials that are predicted to exist, based on our current scientific theories, and the more scientific theory develops, the more it can inform our technological advancements. Our ability to create such powerful computers is informed by our science. Quantum computers are being developed, based on our science on the topic, which will further our computing power by orders of magnitude.</p><p></p><p>But technology also changes how we do science. Think about the invention of the telescope. It vastly changed our ability to conduct astronomical research. Space telescopes, probes like Voyager, the Cassini probe and the Huygens lander, etc have done even more. Even more recently, technological advancements have allowed us to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth, which has allowed us to actually photograph a black hole (or really the material around it).</p><p></p><p>I happened to pick astronomy as an example, but the influence technology has had on science is — well — astronomical. Computing power, storage capacity, and so on has allowed for data science and the use of big data in medical sciences, sociology, economics, and more. So the very computers that are being developed, using scientific theory and evidence, also help us do scientific research.</p><p></p><p>Technology and Society</p><p>In some ways, the influence that technology has had on society is obvious. It’s also very profound. Just consider your ability to ask the Quora community this question, and our ability to answer. It would not exist without technology. Social media, the internet as a whole, blockchain technology, etc all have had significant influences on society.</p><p></p><p>Of course earlier technological revolutions such as the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution cannot be ignored either. The ability to create materials that we use in our everyday life, the ability to feed a massive amount of people, and so on, are all thanks to the development of technological innovations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while technology has been a great boon for prosperity, it has also had some negative impacts. It has produced quite a bit of pollution, though hopefully technology and science will cure that issue. Probably the worst use of technology — and the science which informs its development — has been weapons of mass destruction.</p><p></p><p>In the opposite direction, society drives technology and sometimes prohibits its development. I recently finished a piece on the ethics of fiction writing, in which I touched on the importance that fiction has had on inspiring new technology and warning of threats that we could face in the future[1]. Society also drives technological evolution through need. Very often a technology emerges because someone recognizes a need for that technology.</p><p></p><p>Science and Society</p><p>Just as technology often develops because there is a need for it, science helps solve the needs of society. While a major goal of science is to simply better our understanding, many people leverage science to help solve real world problems in society.</p><p></p><p>The need for a better understanding of epidemics, for instance, drives our research of the topic. Science also improves our understanding of society. Anthropology, sociology, economics, political science, and so on, all help us better understand how society functions. Additionally, like with technology, society can influence our theories, and their evolution. A desire to travel through time, or faster than the speed of light is more than enough to spur on the development of theories that, if correct, would allow such things.</p><p></p><p>Finally, because science alters our understanding of the world, it has had a significant impact on our belief systems, our norms, and our values, as well as our daily behaviors. Germ theory, for instance, has changed our sanitation habits and our hygiene, as well as our food safety protocols. Hand washing is an essential habit that we have primarily because of our understanding of how pathogens spread. And it’s just one of many ways in which scientific theory and evidence has changed our behavior.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Baka po sabihin nyo mahaba.</strong></p><p><strong>Sana ito po yung tamang sagot.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Research the meaning of and differences between science, technology, and society.<p></p><p>Science, technology, and society are interconnected fields that have significant impacts on each other.</p><p></p>What is Science?<p></p><p>Science refers to the systematic study of the natural world, including physical, biological, and social phenomena, using empirical evidence and experimentation. It is the foundation of knowledge creation and the basis for the development of new technologies.</p><p></p>What is Technology?<p></p><p>Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to practical problems. It involves the creation, design, development, and use of tools, machines, and processes that help to solve problems and improve human life. Technology is a product of science that has been applied to solve a problem.</p><p></p>What is Society?<p></p><p>Society refers to the collective behavior, culture, and organization of people in a community or a country. It involves the social, political, and economic interactions of individuals, groups, and institutions. Society shapes science and technology, while science and technology shape society.</p><p></p>Relationship between science, technology, and society:<p></p><p>The relationship between science, technology, and society is complex and multidirectional. Science drives technology by providing new knowledge and discoveries, while technology transforms science by making new discoveries possible. Society shapes science and technology by funding and prioritizing research based on social needs and values. Science and technology shape society by providing solutions to social problems and changing the way people live and work.</p><p></p>Which comes first to exist, science or technology?<p></p><p>It is difficult to determine which came first, science or technology.</p><p></p><p>Science involves the study of the natural world, which dates back to ancient times, where people used observations and empirical evidence to understand the world around them. On the other hand, technology is the application of scientific knowledge to practical problems. The development of technology can be traced back to prehistoric times when humans created tools from natural materials.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it can be said that science and technology have evolved together and are intertwined. Science provides the knowledge and discoveries that are applied in the development of technology. Technology, in turn, creates new opportunities for scientific research and discovery. Hence, it is difficult to determine which came first, as they have co-existed and developed together throughout history.</p><p></p><p>pa brainliest po ty</p><br />

Meanwhile, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Though the United States and its allies have taken significant punitive actions against Russia during the seven-year-old conflict, they have made little headway in helping to restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity. A buildup of Russian military forces along the border with Ukraine in late 2021 stoked fears that Moscow is preparing for a large-scale invasion of its neighbor, although the Kremlin has denied this.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
