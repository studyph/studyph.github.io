                      One day, a lion was sleeping. A mouse runs over the lion's nose and the lion wakes up. The lion is angry. The mouse is scared. "I’m very sorry," says the mouse. "Don’t eat me! I can help you one day." The lion laughs. "That’s funny!" It speaks. "You are little! How can you help me?" But the lion is not angry now. The mouse runs away. One year later, the lion is walking in the jungle. A big net falls over the lion. The lion opens its mouth and roars. The mouse hears the lion, and it runs to help. "Don’t move," says the mouse. "I can help you." The mouse chews the net and makes a big hole. The lion is free. "Thank you," says the lion. "You are little, but you are kind.

The lion woke up, but his paw on the mouse and open his big mouth. He wanted to eat the mouse. "Oh, king," cried the mouse." I am sorry! I will never climb on you again!" Maybe one day I will also help you." The lion laughed at the silly mouse." Ha, ha, ha! How can a small thing like a mouse help a strong lion?" But he let the mouse go. One week, hunters caught the lion. They tied the lion to a tree and went to find a wagon to carry him away. The little mouse heard the lion roar. When he saw the big lion, he said, "I am going to help you!" slowly he ate away the ropes. "I told you I can help you," said the little mouse and he was right. https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/295759900512685624/ 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happen? 1​</a>

                      One day, a lion was sleeping. A mouse runs over the lion's nose and the lion wakes up. The lion is angry. The mouse is scared. "I’m very sorry," says the mouse. "Don’t eat me! I can help you one day." The lion laughs. "That’s funny!" It speaks. "You are little! How can you help me?" But the lion is not angry now. The mouse runs away. One year later, the lion is walking in the jungle. A big net falls over the lion. The lion opens its mouth and roars. The mouse hears the lion, and it runs to help. "Don’t move," says the mouse. "I can help you." The mouse chews the net and makes a big hole. The lion is free. "Thank you," says the lion. "You are little, but you are kind.

                            3. the lion never universally symbolize?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> The lion is a very diverse symbol. Its most common traits are: majesty, strength, courage, justice, and military might. It can be both solar and lunar. Commonly reffered to as "the KING of the beasts," it is a symbol of Kingly power and might, but as the lioness it is commonly related to the Great Mother and protection. In a Christian context, the lion can be the power and might of Christ, or the open maw of Satan. Greek myth links this beast to Heracles and his epic wrestling match with a supernatural lion, which no earthly weapon could harm. In this context the lion is death, beaten by the solar hero. After killing the lion with his bare HANDS, Heracles wore its skin as a sort of ARMOR. </p><p>As the opposite of the EAGLE, the lion can represent earth, as the presider over many floods he can represent fertility, and as a hellish beast he can represent the underworld. Relates to almost any proud, courageous characteristic. In psychology, the wild lion is the type of the latent passions, the dangers of the Unconscious. The parts of the lion carry different symbolism as well: carcase - connected with honey; head - care and vigilance; tooth - eternal and indestructable, Yeats; winged - fire.</p><br />

                            5. The Lion and the Mouse 
                      One day, a lion was sleeping. A mouse runs over the lion's nose and the lion wakes up. The lion is angry. The mouse is scared. "I’m very sorry," says the mouse. "Don’t eat me! I can help you one day." The lion laughs. "That’s funny!" It speaks. "You are little! How can you help me?" But the lion is not angry now. The mouse runs away. One year later, the lion is walking in the jungle. A big net falls over the lion. The lion opens its mouth and roars. The mouse hears the lion, and it runs to help. "Don’t move," says the mouse. "I can help you." The mouse chews the net and makes a big hole. The lion is free. "Thank you," says the lion. "You are little, but you are kind.

                        A Metaphor is an implied Simile. It does not, like a Simile, state that one thing is like another or acts as another, but takes that for granted and proceeds as if two things were one. Thus when we say, 'He fought as fiercely as a lion', it is Simile. But when we say, 'He was a lion in the fight', it is Metaphor.<br />

How can a small thing like a mouse help a strong lion?" But he let the mouse go. One week, hunters caught the lion. They tied the lion to a tree and went to find a wagon to carry him away.

                      One day, a lion was sleeping. A mouse runs over the lion's nose and the lion wakes up. The lion is angry. The mouse is scared. "I’m very sorry," says the mouse. "Don’t eat me! I can help you one day." The lion laughs. "That’s funny!" It speaks. "You are little! How can you help me?" But the lion is not angry now. The mouse runs away. One year later, the lion is walking in the jungle. A big net falls over the lion. The lion opens its mouth and roars. The mouse hears the lion, and it runs to help. "Don’t move," says the mouse. "I can help you." The mouse chews the net and makes a big hole. The lion is free. "Thank you," says the lion. "You are little, but you are kind.

                        As explained in previous posts, we often create metaphors based on the behavior or appearance of animals. In those posts, I shared how pets and farm animals are the source of metaphors in politics. Today I would like to share a few examples of how we create conceptual metaphors based on our experiences with wild animals. As I mentioned previously, it makes sense that we create metaphors based on common experiences with household pets and domestic farm animals.   However, we also create metaphors based on the appearance and behavior of wild animals, most of which the average person has never seen except in zoos, or in books, magazines, television programs or films. It is indicative of the power of the human mind that we can create figurative language based on experiences we have only had second hand. With that in mind, imagine how these metaphors were created…<br /><br />The lion is a ferocious African animal largely considered to be the “king of the jungle.” Rarely, a government leader will also be referred to as a lion because of his strength and wisdom.<br /><br />A lion is said to roar when it is angry. Some politicians also roar if they have a strong voice and argue their points well in debates. Some feminists also that women should roar to gain more civil rights in American society, partially inspired by singer Helen Reddy’s song, “I am Woman” with the chorus, “Hear Me Roar.”<br /><br />The tiger is another ferocious animal. However, without its teeth, it is pretty harmless. In politics, a government agency that does not enforce any laws is considered a toothless tiger.<br /><br />A bear is a big powerful animal. Bears also hibernate or sleep most of the winter. When they wake up in the spring, they are thought to be hungry and dangerous. In world politics, Russia has been referred to as the sleeping bear.<br /><br />When the stock market is on a downward trend and losing money for investors, this is called a bear market, comparing the movement of the market to the activity of a bear when it is asleep in the winter. (Compare to bull market explained in a previous post.)<br /><br />
