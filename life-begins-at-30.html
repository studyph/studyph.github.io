With an average of 3 hours burning per start, it could only last for 10,000 hours3. The life of fluorescent lamp is affected by the fluctuation of voltage andcurrent alone.4. The fluorescent must be provided with some device for limiting the currendrawn by the discharge.5. The point of connection of the fluorescent begins with starter alone6. Without a limiting device, the current would rise to a value that would destroy thefluorescent lamp.7. In wiring the fluorescent lamp, we should insert the wire to the ballast's terminalblock.8. Ballast consumes power, which is between 30% of power consumed by the lampitsell.9. No external starter is required with the hot-cathode, rapid-start fluorescent lampassembly10. The lamp cathode in the instant-start is not pre-heated.Activity 3: Differentiate metքʟsssss քa saɢօt քօ ʄօʀ ʍʏ ɮʀօtɦɛʀ ​</a>

                        ANSWER<p>21. In botany, the radicle is the first part of a seedling (a growing plant embryo) to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. The radicle is the embryonic root of the plant, and grows downward in the soil (the shoot emerges from the plumule).</p><p></p>22.radicle <p>The primary root, or radicle, is the first organ to appear when a seed germinates. It grows downward into the soil, anchoring the seedling.

Seed coats help protect the embryo from injury and also from drying out. Seed coats can be thin and soft as in beans or thick and hard as in locust or coconut seeds.</p><p></p>25.dicot <p>If two cotyledons appear in a germinating seed, the plant is said to be dicot or dicotyledonous.

Having that said so, you may begin listing down a monthly plan that will serve as your guide in improving yourself. For example, in Day 1, you can write "I will try to reach out to a friend whom I know I have hurt feelings back then' or 'I will research about ways to become a better individual." Note that in your monthly plan, it is acceptable to leave some days blank if you intend not to include an activity on that day. Be creative, inspired, and enjoy planning!
