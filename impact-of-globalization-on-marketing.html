                                            true or false1). Foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when a firm invests directly in facilities to produce or market a product in a foreign country. 2). According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, FDI occurs whenever a U.S. citizen, organization, or affiliated group takes an interest of 10 percent or more in a foreign business entity. 3. FDI takes in two main forms, the first is a greenfield investment, which involves the establishment of a new operation in a foreign country; and 4. The second involves acquiring or merging with an existing firm in the foreign country (most of Starbucks’ expansion has been in the form of greenfield Britain’s Seattle Coffee. 5. When discussing foreign direct investment, it is important to distinguish between the flow of FDI and the stock of FDI. 6. The flow of FDI refers to the amount of FDI undertaken over a given time period (normally a year). 7. The average yearly outflow of FDI increased from $25 billion in 1975 to a record $1.2 trillion in 2000. 8. Executives see FDI as a way of circumventing future trade barriers. 9. The globalization of the world economy is also having a positive impact on the volume of FDI. 10).During the 1980s and 1990s, the United States was often the favorite target for FDI inflows.11). Exporting involves producing goods at home and then shipping them to the receiving country for sale. 12). Licensing involves granting a foreign entity (the licensee) the right to produce and sell the firm’s product in return for a royalty fee on every unit sold. 13). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expensive because a firm must bear the costs of establishing production facilities in a foreign country or of acquiring a foreign enterprise. 14). when a firm allows another enterprise to produce its products under license, the license bear costs or risks. 15). The viability of an exporting strategy is often constrained by transportation costs and trade barriers. 16). By placing tariffs on imported goods, governments can increase the cost of exporting relative to foreign direct investment and licensing. 17). Licensing may result in a firm’s giving away valuable know- how to a potential foreign competitor. 18). Countries should specialize in the production of those goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. 19). The pragmatic nationalist view is that FDI has both benefits and costs. 20). When a foreign company rather than a domestic company produces products, the profits from that investment go abroad. ​</a>

Hundreds ofhousands of species are killed as they lose their habitats due to forest fires, cuttinglown of trees etc. deforestation also accelerates global warming because when theree decomposes it releases the CO2 it absorbed when growing to makecarbohydrates, fats and proteins. When a large number of trees are removed from anarea, it causes soil erosion because there is no vegetation to reduce the impact ofnard rain on the soil and there are no roots to hold the soil in place. It causesdesertification (arable land is transformed to desert). Deforestation could also resultin landslides and avalanches. Trees sustain freshwater supplies, so if they are cutdown, it affects the availability of one of life's basic needs. Climate changes occur ifforests are cut down, and the oxygen levels are also affected. Fewer trees also meanthe loss of jobs for forest workers and there is a loss of future markets for ecotourism.Heavy rainfall and high sunlight damages the topsoil once the trees are gone and theforest takes much longer to regenerate and the land is unsuitable for agriculture.Lifted from http: /LLULL.jarse.com/images/fullodf/15737672 187 adi1.

                                            Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</a>

It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</a>

                            4. true or false1). Foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs when a firm invests directly in facilities to produce or market a product in a foreign country. 2). According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, FDI occurs whenever a U.S. citizen, organization, or affiliated group takes an interest of 10 percent or more in a foreign business entity. 3. FDI takes in two main forms, the first is a greenfield investment, which involves the establishment of a new operation in a foreign country; and 4. The second involves acquiring or merging with an existing firm in the foreign country (most of Starbucks’ expansion has been in the form of greenfield Britain’s Seattle Coffee. 5. When discussing foreign direct investment, it is important to distinguish between the flow of FDI and the stock of FDI. 6. The flow of FDI refers to the amount of FDI undertaken over a given time period (normally a year). 7. The average yearly outflow of FDI increased from $25 billion in 1975 to a record $1.2 trillion in 2000. 8. Executives see FDI as a way of circumventing future trade barriers. 9. The globalization of the world economy is also having a positive impact on the volume of FDI. 10).During the 1980s and 1990s, the United States was often the favorite target for FDI inflows.11). Exporting involves producing goods at home and then shipping them to the receiving country for sale. 12). Licensing involves granting a foreign entity (the licensee) the right to produce and sell the firm’s product in return for a royalty fee on every unit sold. 13). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expensive because a firm must bear the costs of establishing production facilities in a foreign country or of acquiring a foreign enterprise. 14). when a firm allows another enterprise to produce its products under license, the license bear costs or risks. 15). The viability of an exporting strategy is often constrained by transportation costs and trade barriers. 16). By placing tariffs on imported goods, governments can increase the cost of exporting relative to foreign direct investment and licensing. 17). Licensing may result in a firm’s giving away valuable know- how to a potential foreign competitor. 18). Countries should specialize in the production of those goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. 19). The pragmatic nationalist view is that FDI has both benefits and costs. 20). When a foreign company rather than a domestic company produces products, the profits from that investment go abroad. ​</h2><br />

Introduction by host: Youth have always faced inordinately high vulnerabilities in the world’s labor markets. They are often the first to lose their jobs in a recession, as they did in the last global financial crisis more than a decade ago. But the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been different. We started already from a situation of great hardship and extreme vulnerability for young people. The crisis has hit demand and supply. It has hit all countries through direct effects through the lockdown and containment measures, also through indirect effects in terms of disruption to trade, tourism, migration, remittances, et cetera. Perhaps the most important conclusion in our Monitor, is that of young people who were working prior to the pandemic, well more than 1 in 6 of those young people is now no longer working. Young workers that are also more likely to be in temporary and informal jobs with less protection. 11.

                            7. what are the circumstances of "traditional balance between nation-state", "balance between nation-state and global markets", and "balance between individual and nation-state" and its impact to globalization system?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Unlike conventional wisdom, globalization and nation-states are phenomena that do not contradict each other, but are rather part of the same universe of contemporary capitalism. Soon after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s, globalization was presented as an indication of American hegemony and of the affirmation of a single path to economic development - the neo-liberal path of the Washington Consensus or of conventional orthodoxy.1 On the opposite side, economists and politicians identified with the new hegemony said that globalization would benefit everyone. Martin Wolf (2004: 4) summarized this view: "The failure of our world is not that there is too much globalization but that there is too little". In the same line, the World Bank (2002) published a report in which it stressed globalization's success in promoting the reduction of poverty and the catching up. In order to demonstrate its point of view, it divided nation-states into three groups - rich ones, more globalized developing ones, and less globalized developing ones - showing that, in the 1990s, whereas the per capita growth rate of rich countries increased nearly 2%, and the growth rate of more globalized developing countries (corresponding to nearly three billion inhabitants) grew at rates around 5%, in less globalized countries the rates were negative, around 1% per annum. The report also regards both trade and financial globalization as positive, although, as to the second one it is forced to acknowledge an increase in financial crises. This is where my key disagreement lies. Whereas I regard trade globalization as a competitive opportunity for middle-income countries - an opportunity to catching up - I understand that financial globalization is usually disastrous for developing countries, since it makes them unable to neutralize the tendency to the overvaluation of the exchange rate.</p><br />

                            21. a separate sheet.DeforestationThere are various harmful consequences of deforestation. Hundreds ofhousands of species are killed as they lose their habitats due to forest fires, cuttinglown of trees etc. deforestation also accelerates global warming because when theree decomposes it releases the CO2 it absorbed when growing to makecarbohydrates, fats and proteins. When a large number of trees are removed from anarea, it causes soil erosion because there is no vegetation to reduce the impact ofnard rain on the soil and there are no roots to hold the soil in place. It causesdesertification (arable land is transformed to desert). Deforestation could also resultin landslides and avalanches. Trees sustain freshwater supplies, so if they are cutdown, it affects the availability of one of life's basic needs. Climate changes occur ifforests are cut down, and the oxygen levels are also affected. Fewer trees also meanthe loss of jobs for forest workers and there is a loss of future markets for ecotourism.Heavy rainfall and high sunlight damages the topsoil once the trees are gone and theforest takes much longer to regenerate and the land is unsuitable for agriculture.Lifted from http: /LLULL.jarse.com/images/fullodf/15737672 187 adi1.

                            24. Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</h2><br />
                        <strong>The Negative Impact of Global Free Trade </strong><p>Now that international or foreign brands may enter and exit the country so easily as a result of global free trade, we tend to have easier access to them (through online shopping). As a result of the high demand for international goods, citizens may eventually start to <strong>disregard</strong> the nation's own local products and economy.</p><p></p><p>Global free trade is taking place between various nations or jurisdictions where there are no limits or limitations on the import or export of commodities, resources, information, services, and technology, including taxes, prohibitions, and quotas. </p><p></p><p>Free trade may benefit our economy, but it frequently threatens its stability and causes harm, particularly to <strong>workers.</strong> This could reduce market competition and result in lower local demand for goods and services. Free trade may increase economic output and expand market opportunities. All the goods and services that are being traded can be had for less money. We choose to purchase items or services that are inexpensive, which is bad for local businesses and workers. These could lead to wage stagnation, declining demand, rising unemployment, and underpaid labor, which would negate the advantages of this global free trade.</p><p></p><p>According to this<strong> viewpoint,</strong> global free trade benefits more businesses, but for the poor, it poses a threat to their way of life and may have detrimental effects on other local employees and marketplaces.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about market here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/17316809#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</h2><br />
