Welcome to My Beautiful ClassroomThere are lots of reasons why I like my classroom. First, it is big and roomy. We sit atrectangle tables that are about six feet by two feet. Since there are four of us sitting at the table, we have lots of room. The chairs are comfortable. They are bright orange and have matching cushion seats and backs. The floor has a light green rag, which means we don't need tennis balls on the chair legs to keep the noise down. The bulletin boards are neat. They run from the floor to the ceiling, and our teacher writes on them in bright colors.There is a great reading area in our room. It has a blue couch that my teacher said used tobe in her apartment. The sofa has four comfy pillows: two red, one yellow, and white blue-striped. Next to the couch are many books in big, bright-colored baskets, so I never had a problem finding someone I like to read. My classroom? It's the best! ​</a>

Welcome to My Beautiful ClassroomThere are lots of reasons why I like my classroom. First, it is big and roomy. We sit atrectangle tables that are about six feet by two feet. Since there are four of us sitting at the table, we have lots of room. The chairs are comfortable. They are bright orange and have matching cushion seats and backs. The floor has a light green rag, which means we don't need tennis balls on the chair legs to keep the noise down. The bulletin boards are neat. They run from the floor to the ceiling, and our teacher writes on them in bright colors.There is a great reading area in our room. It has a blue couch that my teacher said used tobe in her apartment. The sofa has four comfy pillows: two red, one yellow, and white blue-striped. Next to the couch are many books in big, bright-colored baskets, so I never had a problem finding someone I like to read.
