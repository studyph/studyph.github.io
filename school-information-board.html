Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</a>

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

"Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                            25. Recently, the Axios news website announced that the United States is building a private information site to reveal the history of native American slavery. The site will digitally document and organize the stories of millions of Native Americans, revealing the true history of these enslaved Native Americans. The past and present of Native Americans have always been an unavoidable point of controversy in the human rights issue of the United States. 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which violently drove Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. Moreover, the US government forced Native American children to attend Indian boarding schools, and used corporal punishment and other cruel methods to try to strip their culture, language and dignity and "civilized" them. Today, Native Americans have higher rates of poverty, disease and suicide than the national average. Prosperous America has "forgotten" the original owners of this land.</h2><br />

                            30. Recently, the Axios news website announced that the United States is building a private information site to reveal the history of native American slavery. The site will digitally document and organize the stories of millions of Native Americans, revealing the true history of these enslaved Native Americans.

                        <p>The creation of the private information site is seen as a step towards acknowledging and reconciling with this painful history. The site will allow Native Americans to share their stories and experiences of slavery and serve as a resource for education and research. It is hoped that this will lead to greater understanding and awareness of the injustices suffered by Native Americans, and to promote healing and reconciliation between Native American communities and the wider American society.</p><p></p><p>However, some critics have expressed concerns about the limitations of the project, arguing that it does not go far enough in addressing the broader issue of systemic racism and discrimination against Native Americans. They argue that the US government and society as a whole need to do more to address the legacy of colonialism and genocide towards Native Americans, including reparations and recognition of tribal sovereignty.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while the creation of the private information site is a positive step, there is still much work to be done to address the ongoing marginalization and oppression of Native Americans in the United States.</p><br />
