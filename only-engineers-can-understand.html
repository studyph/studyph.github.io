                                            A business arena is a world that is very unpredictable and can change dramatically.Drucker stated that, only if business learns how to convert the major existing struggles facing developed societies today into novel and profitable business opportunities can we hope to surmount these challenges in the future (2007). The main purpose of a business is to earn profit. To achieve that, a business should be able to learn from transforming the existing struggles of small merchandise business into an opportunity, which used something beneficial. According to George N Root I (2018) in order to address the struggles of small business owners, you must first understand and identify these daily business issues. Such as employee turnover, financing, time management, marketing costs and access to new technology. Likewise, a study by Bureau of Labor Statistics written by Lindsay Kolowich 2013 stated that the following struggles are being faced by small businesses as of today: finding customers, hiring talented people, spreading product awareness and if possible building an email list of dealing with online businesses. In theory, from the Small Business Blog with various authors cited the following struggles that it really exist in their businesses. First,stated by Damon Pendleton (2013) that one of the largest struggles that is constant when you deal with business is on how to attract customers. Also, "the online market place is highly competitive and i tough to stand out in the crowd", stated by Chris Terrazas (2013). In add itition, a blog from Ibuyhomes.com posted by Tobb Hutcheson (2013), said that in his ten years in retailed business his biggest struggle deals with marketing in a statement he added that his biggest struggle is keeping up with the rules, regulations and best practices of search engine optimization. Wallace (2013) asserts that, in his experience in the small business sectors he conclude Our largest struggle by far is paying our payroll taxes and not being able to afford to paid it on the right time"</a>

                                            Date: April 11, 2023 Most Essential Learning Competency (MELC) TOPIC SCIENCE 7 INTERVENTION Learning Task A. Reading Selection Electricity may be described as a form of energy. Understanding electricity entails understanding charges - the basic unit of electricity. Charge is a quantity measured in Coulombs (C). Charges may be transferred to and from objects and may move in conductors as current measured in Amperes (I). The world we live in is highly dependent on the electric energy and power (measured in Watts) supplied by our power plants. The unit watt (W) is named to honor James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine during the industrial revolution. Electric charge is an intrinsic property of protons and electrons. Charge is a quantity with a magnitude and unit. The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C). A neutron has zero net electrical charge because it is neutral A proton carries a positive charge (+e), while electron carries a negative charge (-e). These two types of charges (positive and negative) were named by Benjamin Franklin. JJ. Thomson discovered the electron an Robert Millikan discovered the charge of the electron. The charge of the electron is the negative of the elementary charge e which is equal to 1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb. The charge of the electron and the proton are the same only that the proton is positive (+1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb). Like sign of charges repel and unlike sign of charges attract each other. Materials may contain several charges and when these are neutral, they contain equal numbers of positive and negative charges. Materials or bodies may be left with a certain charge. This may be done through the process of charging. charging means gaining or losing electrons. There are various types of charging processes namely, charging by friction, charging by conduction, and charging by induction. Let us describe first the process of charging through friction. Guide Questions: 1. What is the charge of a neutron? 2. Who discovered the electron? Describe the different types of charging processes (MELC 21) Electricity There are many different types of atoms, and these atoms can combine in a variety of ways to form the nature of objects we encounter every day. Depending on the type of atoms an object is made of, an object can be more or less attracted to an electron. This electrical property is known as electron affinity. If an object has a high electron affinity, then it is more attractive to electrons. Different materials have different affinities of electrons. This is important as we explore the most common methods of charging-triboelectri charging, also known as charging by friction or rubbing. 3. Who invented the steam engine? 4. What is electron affinity? 5. What is electricity? 6. What is current? 7. What is the unit of power? 8. What is the charge? 9. What is triboelectric charging? 10. How can materials be charged?​</a>

                                            I firmly believe that James Clerk Maxwell should be considered on the top 10 list due to many reasons. Maxwell is a well-known scientist, but he is not much talked about as Einstein and Newton, until we come across topics such as electromagnetism in our Science class. I believe that he is one among the most underrated scientist who have not been frequently taught in schools while his works are being introduced in several fields. His greatest contribution lies on the field of physics and mathematics and his theory of electromagnetism has catapulted several innovations and advances that we rely on today. 
Due to his theory of electromagnetism, we are able to enjoy different technologies and devices that involve wireless communication. Maxwell gave us the foundation and ideas in order for inventors to create the modern technology we are using today. He did not only provide us convenience, but also a more productive life as we can now communicate easily through the development of these technologies. Maxwell's groundbreaking accomplishments have led to several crucial discoveries in science, especially in the technological and astronomical aspect. He was also able to contribute greatly towards the field of engineering.
Due to his brilliant mind, we are now able to understand the behavior of light and electromagnetism and other concepts that surrounds it. Through Maxwell's groundwork, we are able to live efficiently today and for the next generation. He has changed the way we live our lives- from communicating, to traveling, to viewing the universe. Indeed, Maxwell was a true genius who changed our understanding of the world with his theories and discoveries and had made a great impact to the society.</a>

                            4. A business arena is a world that is very unpredictable and can change dramatically.Drucker stated that, only if business learns how to convert the major existing struggles facing developed societies today into novel and profitable business opportunities can we hope to surmount these challenges in the future (2007). The main purpose of a business is to earn profit. To achieve that, a business should be able to learn from transforming the existing struggles of small merchandise business into an opportunity, which used something beneficial. According to George N Root I (2018) in order to address the struggles of small business owners, you must first understand and identify these daily business issues. Such as employee turnover, financing, time management, marketing costs and access to new technology. Likewise, a study by Bureau of Labor Statistics written by Lindsay Kolowich 2013 stated that the following struggles are being faced by small businesses as of today: finding customers, hiring talented people, spreading product awareness and if possible building an email list of dealing with online businesses. In theory, from the Small Business Blog with various authors cited the following struggles that it really exist in their businesses. First,stated by Damon Pendleton (2013) that one of the largest struggles that is constant when you deal with business is on how to attract customers. Also, "the online market place is highly competitive and i tough to stand out in the crowd", stated by Chris Terrazas (2013). In add itition, a blog from Ibuyhomes.com posted by Tobb Hutcheson (2013), said that in his ten years in retailed business his biggest struggle deals with marketing in a statement he added that his biggest struggle is keeping up with the rules, regulations and best practices of search engine optimization. Wallace (2013) asserts that, in his experience in the small business sectors he conclude Our largest struggle by far is paying our payroll taxes and not being able to afford to paid it on the right time"</h2><br />

                            5. Date: April 11, 2023 Most Essential Learning Competency (MELC) TOPIC SCIENCE 7 INTERVENTION Learning Task A. Reading Selection Electricity may be described as a form of energy. Understanding electricity entails understanding charges - the basic unit of electricity. Charge is a quantity measured in Coulombs (C). Charges may be transferred to and from objects and may move in conductors as current measured in Amperes (I). The world we live in is highly dependent on the electric energy and power (measured in Watts) supplied by our power plants. The unit watt (W) is named to honor James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine during the industrial revolution. Electric charge is an intrinsic property of protons and electrons. Charge is a quantity with a magnitude and unit. The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C). A neutron has zero net electrical charge because it is neutral A proton carries a positive charge (+e), while electron carries a negative charge (-e). These two types of charges (positive and negative) were named by Benjamin Franklin. JJ. Thomson discovered the electron an Robert Millikan discovered the charge of the electron. The charge of the electron is the negative of the elementary charge e which is equal to 1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb. The charge of the electron and the proton are the same only that the proton is positive (+1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb). Like sign of charges repel and unlike sign of charges attract each other. Materials may contain several charges and when these are neutral, they contain equal numbers of positive and negative charges. Materials or bodies may be left with a certain charge. This may be done through the process of charging. charging means gaining or losing electrons. There are various types of charging processes namely, charging by friction, charging by conduction, and charging by induction. Let us describe first the process of charging through friction. Guide Questions: 1. What is the charge of a neutron? 2. Who discovered the electron? Describe the different types of charging processes (MELC 21) Electricity There are many different types of atoms, and these atoms can combine in a variety of ways to form the nature of objects we encounter every day. Depending on the type of atoms an object is made of, an object can be more or less attracted to an electron. This electrical property is known as electron affinity. If an object has a high electron affinity, then it is more attractive to electrons. Different materials have different affinities of electrons. This is important as we explore the most common methods of charging-triboelectri charging, also known as charging by friction or rubbing. 3. Who invented the steam engine? 4. What is electron affinity? 5. What is electricity? 6. What is current? 7. What is the unit of power? 8. What is the charge? 9. What is triboelectric charging? 10. How can materials be charged?​</h2><br />

                            9. I firmly believe that James Clerk Maxwell should be considered on the top 10 list due to many reasons. Maxwell is a well-known scientist, but he is not much talked about as Einstein and Newton, until we come across topics such as electromagnetism in our Science class. I believe that he is one among the most underrated scientist who have not been frequently taught in schools while his works are being introduced in several fields. His greatest contribution lies on the field of physics and mathematics and his theory of electromagnetism has catapulted several innovations and advances that we rely on today. 
Due to his theory of electromagnetism, we are able to enjoy different technologies and devices that involve wireless communication. Maxwell gave us the foundation and ideas in order for inventors to create the modern technology we are using today. He did not only provide us convenience, but also a more productive life as we can now communicate easily through the development of these technologies. Maxwell's groundbreaking accomplishments have led to several crucial discoveries in science, especially in the technological and astronomical aspect. He was also able to contribute greatly towards the field of engineering.
Due to his brilliant mind, we are now able to understand the behavior of light and electromagnetism and other concepts that surrounds it. Through Maxwell's groundwork, we are able to live efficiently today and for the next generation. He has changed the way we live our lives- from communicating, to traveling, to viewing the universe. Indeed, Maxwell was a true genius who changed our understanding of the world with his theories and discoveries and had made a great impact to the society.</h2><br />
