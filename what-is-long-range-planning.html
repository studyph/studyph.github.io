                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Nail Bed: This is the portion of skin upon which the nail plate rests. It has very rich supply of blood and lymph vessels to keep nail healthy. The function of the nail bed is to supply nourishment and protection.</p><p></p><p>Nail Plate: The nail plate is composed of layers of keratinized skin cells. The layers are packed very closely together with fat but very little water content. The nail gradually grows over the nail bed and becomes free edge. There are no blood vessels or nerves in the nail plate. The pink color of the nail plate derives from the blood vessels that passes beneath it. The main function of the nail plate is to protect the living nail bed of the fingers and toes.</p><p></p><p>The Free Edge: The nail plate leaves the end of the finger and forms a projection that is called the free edge. This is attached to the nail bed and appears as white. The function of the free edge is to protect the fingertip and the hyponychium. This is the part we file and shape!</p><p></p><p>The Hyponychium: This is a part of the epidermis under the free edge of the nail plate. Its function is to protect the nail bed from infection.</p><p></p><p>The Nail Grooves: This lies alongside of the edge of the nail plate. The function of the nail groove is to keep the nail growing in a straight line.</p><p></p><p>The Matrix: This is the growing area of the nail and sometimes called as the nail root. The shape and size of the matrix determines the thickness of the nail. The process of the keratinization takes place in the epidermal cells of the matrix, forming the hardened tissue of the nail plate. The function of the matrix is to produce new nail cells.</p><p></p><p>The Nail Mantle: The nail mantle is the layer of epidermis at the base of the nail, before the cuticle. The function of the nail mantle is to protect the matrix from physical damage.</p><p></p><p>The Lunula: This is located at the base of the nail, lying over the matrix. It is white in color and known as half-moon. The nail is slightly soft in this area and can be easily damaged.</p><p></p><p>The Cuticle: The overlapping epidermis around the base of the nail is called the cuticle. The function of the cuticle is to protect the matrix from infection.</p><p></p><p>The Nail Walls: These are the folds of the skin overlapping the sides of the nails. The function of the nail wall is to protect the nail plate edges.</p><p></p><p>The Perionychium: This is the collective name given to the nail walls and the cuticle area.</p><p></p><p>The Eponychium: This is the extension of the cuticle at the base of the nail plate, under which the nail plate emerges from matrix. The function of eponychium is to protect matrix from infection.</p><p></p><p>Is that a lot of info to digest? Well, atleast now you know your nails are so much more than a bunch of dead cells! We are big on the how and why of thing. And now that you know all that happens with these beauteous things, we can’t wait to share more with you about caring for your nails and even creating some funky nail art.</p><br />

Answer the questions below in your MAPEH activity notebook Directions: Read the statements carefully. Then, write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect 1. A short-term goal should be developed with a limited amount of time in mind. 2. Exercise program is a planned activity detailing a range of Physical exercises and its allotted time that is suited to individuals' needs. 3. Principle of progression indicates that you must train a specific energy system and specific muscle groups in order for the muscles to improve. 4. Intensity is the degree of effort or exertion put forth by an individual during exercise. 5. Frequency refers to the number of exercise sessions per week. 6. Static stretches are more appropriate in the cool down as they help muscle to relax. 7. Exercise heart rate should be measured first thing in the morning with your index and middle finger and a stopwatch. 8. Dynamic stretching exercises specifically prepare the muscles for active contraction. 9. An effective warm-up increases both the respiratory and the heart rate. 10. Maximum Heart Rate (Hrmax) is the fastest that your heart can beat when doing activity 11. Principle of progression indicates that load could be increased gradually overtime to remain effective and safe for best results. 12. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. 13. A long-term goal is something that requires time and planning. 14. Principle of overload specifies that you must perform physical exercise than normal amounts to get an improvement in physical fitness benefits. 15. Before starting an exercise program, one should set short- and long-term goals.Pls Answer Truthfully I rlly need the answer it is True Or False Btw to people who don't know what it is.Nonsense= Report​</h2><br />
