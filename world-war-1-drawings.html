                                            Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.

Draw your illustration in your notebook.1.Almost all Koreans live in cities, which occupy only a small portion of thenation's total area. The country divides its land by use -- urban areas, managedareas, natural preserves, and farms and forests in order to carry out its planninginitiatives of the categories, urban areas take up 16.7 percent of the country, whilefarms and forests occupy 46.5 percent, followed by 25.6 percent for managed areasand 11.2 percent for preserves.2.South Korea and North Korea took dramatically different paths following theend of fighting in the Korean War in 1953. When it comes to their economies andliving standards, they could hardly be more different. The two Koreas are separatedby the demilitarized zone, a four-kilometer wide strip running along the 38th parallelwhich splits the Korean peninsula roughly in half. To the south of the DMZ, SouthKorea operates one of the world's most advanced economies, while to the north itsneighbor is a military dictatorship that keeps a tight fist on the economy and hasoften struggled to provide enough food to its people. North Korea's economy isisolated and tightly controlled. It is generally unable to meet the basic needs of itspeople. Economists find it difficult to analyze the North Korean economy becausedata is non-existent, unreliable, or outdated. South Korea's economy is one of theworld's most advanced and productive, ranking 12th globally in terms of annualoutput. South Korea's economic growth depends heavily on exports, and the nationleads the world in shipments of semiconductors and memory chips.PA ANSWER PO PLSSSS ​</a>

                            5. Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.

Draw your illustration in your notebook.1.Almost all Koreans live in cities, which occupy only a small portion of thenation's total area. The country divides its land by use -- urban areas, managedareas, natural preserves, and farms and forests in order to carry out its planninginitiatives of the categories, urban areas take up 16.7 percent of the country, whilefarms and forests occupy 46.5 percent, followed by 25.6 percent for managed areasand 11.2 percent for preserves.2.South Korea and North Korea took dramatically different paths following theend of fighting in the Korean War in 1953. When it comes to their economies andliving standards, they could hardly be more different. The two Koreas are separatedby the demilitarized zone, a four-kilometer wide strip running along the 38th parallelwhich splits the Korean peninsula roughly in half. To the south of the DMZ, SouthKorea operates one of the world's most advanced economies, while to the north itsneighbor is a military dictatorship that keeps a tight fist on the economy and hasoften struggled to provide enough food to its people. North Korea's economy isisolated and tightly controlled. It is generally unable to meet the basic needs of itspeople. Economists find it difficult to analyze the North Korean economy becausedata is non-existent, unreliable, or outdated. South Korea's economy is one of theworld's most advanced and productive, ranking 12th globally in terms of annualoutput. South Korea's economic growth depends heavily on exports, and the nationleads the world in shipments of semiconductors and memory chips.PA ANSWER PO PLSSSS ​</h2><br />
