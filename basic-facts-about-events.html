(The President ordered DOLE, OWWA and DOH to make sure that the 24,000 OFWs awaiting their COVID-19 test result are sent home within week.) According to Roque, the President said the concerned agencies may utilize all government resources to ferry the OFWs back to their provinces. Duterte also said there is a need to boost coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing nationwide. “Nagsabi din ang ating Pangulo na kinakailangan palakasin na ang PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing sa iba’t ibang lugar ng Pilipinas, hindi lamang dito sa Metro Manila nang sa ganon, pupuwede na silang umuwi diretso sa kanilang mga probinsya ang mga OFWs at doon na sila magpakuha ng PCT COVID-19 test,” he said. (The President also saw the need to beef up PCR testing nationwide and not only in Metro Manila. That way, OFWs can be tested in their home provinces.) A number of repatriated OFWs have complained that they have been confined to quarantine facilities beyond the mandatory 14-day isolation period due to the delay in the release of their COVID-19 test results.Questions:1.

Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016).

What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot.

The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</a>

Duterte also said there is a need to boost coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing nationwide.“Nagsabi din ang ating Pangulo na kinakailangan palakasin na ang PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing sa iba’t ibang lugar ng Pilipinas, hindi lamang dito sa Metro Manila nang sa ganon, pupuwede na silang umuwi diretso sa kanilang mga probinsya ang mga OFWs at doon na sila magpakuha ng PCT COVID-19 test,” he said.(The President also saw the need to beef up PCR testing nationwide and not only in Metro Manila. That way, OFWs can be tested in their home provinces.)A number of repatriated OFWs have complained that they have been confined to quarantine facilities beyond the mandatory 14-day isolation period due to the delay in the release of their COVID-19 test results.Questions:1.

                            15. Duterte: Send home 24,000 quarantined OFWs in 1 week, expedite release of COVID test resultsBy: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter/@KAguilarINQ INQUIRER.net / 07:19 AM May 25, 2020MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has given the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Health (DOH) a week to send home some 24,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are awaiting their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in various quarantine facilities, Malacañang said Monday. “Inutusan po ng ating Presidente and DOLE, OWWA, at ang DOH na meron lamang silang isang linggo para masiguro na lahat po ng 24,000 na OFWs na kapatid nating mga Pilipino na nagaantay ng resulta ay mapauwi sa kani kanilang probinsya,” Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on state-run PTV4. (The President ordered DOLE, OWWA and DOH to make sure that the 24,000 OFWs awaiting their COVID-19 test result are sent home within week.) According to Roque, the President said the concerned agencies may utilize all government resources to ferry the OFWs back to their provinces. Duterte also said there is a need to boost coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing nationwide. “Nagsabi din ang ating Pangulo na kinakailangan palakasin na ang PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing sa iba’t ibang lugar ng Pilipinas, hindi lamang dito sa Metro Manila nang sa ganon, pupuwede na silang umuwi diretso sa kanilang mga probinsya ang mga OFWs at doon na sila magpakuha ng PCT COVID-19 test,” he said. (The President also saw the need to beef up PCR testing nationwide and not only in Metro Manila. That way, OFWs can be tested in their home provinces.) A number of repatriated OFWs have complained that they have been confined to quarantine facilities beyond the mandatory 14-day isolation period due to the delay in the release of their COVID-19 test results.Questions:1.

                            16. Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy In Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc for the Department of Education) Which sentence states the generalization? How did you know? What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The generalization in the paragraph is that Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways, but it holds the greatest message of all time - the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. This is stated in the last sentence of the paragraph. The examples presented to validate this generalization are the three ways in which Asma's letter is different from a typical Christmas greeting card, and the message of love and justice that the letter contains. The words and phrases that introduce these examples are "One, it isn't a greeting card.

                            22. Duterte: Send home 24,000 quarantined OFWs in 1 week, expedite release of COVID test resultsBy: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter/@KAguilarINQ INQUIRER.net / 07:19 AM May 25, 2020MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has given the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Health (DOH) a week to send home some 24,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are awaiting their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in various quarantine facilities, Malacañang said Monday.“Inutusan po ng ating Presidente and DOLE, OWWA, at ang DOH na meron lamang silang isang linggo para masiguro na lahat po ng 24,000 na OFWs na kapatid nating mga Pilipino na nagaantay ng resulta ay mapauwi sa kani kanilang probinsya,” Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on state-run PTV4.(The President ordered DOLE, OWWA and DOH to make sure that the 24,000 OFWs awaiting their COVID-19 test result are sent home within week.)According to Roque, the President said the concerned agencies may utilize all government resources to ferry the OFWs back to their provinces. Duterte also said there is a need to boost coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing nationwide.“Nagsabi din ang ating Pangulo na kinakailangan palakasin na ang PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing sa iba’t ibang lugar ng Pilipinas, hindi lamang dito sa Metro Manila nang sa ganon, pupuwede na silang umuwi diretso sa kanilang mga probinsya ang mga OFWs at doon na sila magpakuha ng PCT COVID-19 test,” he said.(The President also saw the need to beef up PCR testing nationwide and not only in Metro Manila. That way, OFWs can be tested in their home provinces.)A number of repatriated OFWs have complained that they have been confined to quarantine facilities beyond the mandatory 14-day isolation period due to the delay in the release of their COVID-19 test results.Questions:1.
