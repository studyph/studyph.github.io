It is my honor and previlage to conduct this wonderful speech about nature.</p><p></p><p><strong>Nature</strong> is one of the wonderful God's work. It provides the shelter, needs and resources to all living kind. Such as those tall trees and beautiful plants, that provides oxygen in order to give life to humans and animals. Fruits that came from the trees. It literally provided all of our needs. We human, we only depend on our nature. Every time for every thing as we say natural resources? Many people admire the beauty of the nature and even they write many novels and poems on it, because the beauty of the nature cannot be expressed in one single word. It provided us everything, and that is how God loves us.</p><p></p><p>But we as a descendants and a protector to our world. We usually abuse our Mother Nature, chopping down those trees, killing wildlife animals, and burning down those forest. Just for the sake of their illegal businesses. They didn't care to others and also the outcome of what they did. Because of that, Global Warming gets more active, because no one can cover up the holes of our ozone layer and the result of that, extreme hotness in among the country. Melting Iceberg in Poles region. High Sea-level and cover up those small islands. And also heat stroke, skin cancer and anything.</p><p></p><p>The nature that God created this world, was in a good place to be peacefully, but we humans destroy it. It is because of being a abusive and careless to our nature. Our nature will be in a good condition if we human beings, don't destroy it and take care of it very well, because we literally can get benefits on that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees</p><p>#BrainlyBookSmart</p><br />

As culture changes, so have popular understandings of this debate. In the 1960s, for example, psychologists—and pop culture in general—were heavily influenced by the theories of behaviorism. This theory led to the widespread belief that human personality is primarily influenced by experience and training.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Debate</p><p></p><p> Do inherited traits or life experiences play a greater role in shaping your personality? The nature versus nurture debate is one of the oldest issues in psychology. The debate centers on the relative contributions of genetic inheritance and environmental factors to human development.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>sana makatulong ∆∆[tex] \sqrt{?} [/tex]<p></p><br />

                        <p>task 7:</p><p>Persuasive Speech: Why people Should Connect More with Nature</p><p></p><p>Good morning everyone,</p><p></p><p>Today, I am here to talk about why we should all connect more with nature. We all live in a world that is becoming more and more urbanized every day. We spend most of our time indoors, staring at screens, and we have become disconnected from the natural world. However, I believe that connecting with nature is crucial for our well-being and for the health of the planet.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, connecting with nature has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental health. Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce cortisol levels, which is a hormone associated with stress. It can also help reduce anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, connecting with nature can improve our physical health. Spending time outdoors, hiking, cycling, or simply walking in nature can help us maintain a healthy weight, lower our blood pressure, and reduce our risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, by connecting with nature, we can become more aware of the environmental challenges we face and take action to protect our planet. When we see the beauty of nature firsthand, we are more likely to feel a sense of responsibility towards protecting it for future generations.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, connecting with nature is essential for our well-being and the health of our planet. I urge all of you to spend more time outdoors, connect with nature, and take action to protect our planet. We can all make a difference, no matter how small, and together we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for listening.</p><p></p><p>Task 8:</p><p>Informative texts aim to inform or educate the reader on a particular topic or issue. They present facts, data, and other information in an objective manner. The purpose of an informative text is to convey information and increase the reader's knowledge and understanding of a particular subject.</p><p></p><p>Persuasive texts aim to persuade the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action. They use emotional appeals, logical arguments, and other persuasive techniques to convince the reader to agree with the writer's point of view. The purpose of a persuasive text is to influence the reader's beliefs or behavior.</p><p></p><p>Argumentative texts are similar to persuasive texts in that they aim to convince the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action. However, argumentative texts differ from persuasive texts in that they focus more on logical arguments and evidence to support their point of view. The purpose of an argumentative text is to present a reasoned argument and convince the reader that their viewpoint is valid.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while informative texts aim to inform the reader, persuasive texts aim to convince the reader, and argumentative texts aim to present a reasoned argument to the reader.</p><p></p><p>task 3:</p><p>Strengths:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt provides an informative and detailed overview of the history of chivalry, including its origins and development in medieval Europe.</p><p>The author uses a clear and engaging writing style, with vivid descriptions and anecdotes that bring the subject to life.</p><p>The excerpt provides a comprehensive analysis of the values and ideals associated with chivalry, including honor, courage, loyalty, and respect for women.</p><p>The author provides interesting historical context, such as the role of the Crusades in shaping the development of chivalry.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt is quite lengthy and dense, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow.</p><p>The author relies heavily on historical examples and references, which may be difficult for readers with limited knowledge of medieval history to fully understand.</p><p>The excerpt focuses primarily on the history and ideals of chivalry, and doesn't explore the role of chivalry in literature or popular culture, which may be of interest to some readers.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We know that suicide is a terrible killer of the young. Suicidal attempts of adults are less than the young generation. In the United States, suicide is the third major cause of death in 15-to-19-year-olds and the second leading cause of death in college-age students. In 1996, more teenagers and young adults died from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, stroke, and lung disease combined. Suicide kills the young dreadfully and disproportionately. And, across the world, in those between the ages of 15 and 44, suicide is the second leading killer of women and the fourth of men. Nearly one million people die by suicide each year, 30,000 of them in the United States. </p><p>The young update their status and share their feelings on social medias. Moreover, social media is pressuring the stereotypes onto teenagers and causing developed mental health disorders from lack of self-esteem and deteriorating confidence in oneself. A majority of teens are not only abusing the use of social medias but also spending so much time on their devices. Because of social medias, there are so many stereotypes that teens feel that they need to fit in, therefore; after social media comparison and jealousy with others, if teens don’t achieve these invisible standards on social medias, those things will lead them to self-doubt, heavy depressive feelings. All those things easily interfere teens’ goals and bring up invisible pressures, when a teen has a thought of suicide, social media would be one of the reason that make teens committing suicide. To sum up, suicide is an occurrence that is preventable. With the knowledge of suicide’s signs and symptoms, and along the understanding of the teens’ problems, then a person could react immediately in order to prevent teenage suicide. A person who is willing to prevent a suicide from teenagers, a person should let them know that they still have someone that cares about them, make them feel that they are not being rejected. That person ought to be parents, and they have so many ways to prevent the suicide from the teen kids such as don’t let your teens’ depression or anxiety snowball, listen even your teen is not talking, never shrug off threats of suicide as typical melodrama. Parents should know and understand their kids more than they think they do, and do not ever underestimate the suicide, because parent’s unconcern will make a worse consequence and regret for the rest of their life.   </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
