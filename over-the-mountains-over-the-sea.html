                                            1 Which of the following explains what will happen to a typhoon when it landfall is or hits landmasses?a. The wind speed of the typhoon becomes fasterb. The wind speed of the typhoon becomes weakerc. The wind speed of the typhoon becomes strongerd. The wind capacity of the typhoon becomes stronger 2 Meria noticed that when typhoons came from the west, they barely get affected by such weather systems. But when typhoons originate from the east, they would almost always be dealing with strong winds and sometimes foods. Their village in General Santos City is sandwiched by a mountain range 2 kilometers fre the west and by the sea which is about a kilometer away what can explain her observations?a. Meria is mistaken as typhoons in tropical countries would always follow a west to east routeb. Typhoons cannot possibly originate west of their village as there is no body of water from that directionc. Cold air produced by trees from the mountains weakens the incoming typhoon headed towards the villaged. Mountains have the ability to deflect bodies of air, thus, Meria's village is not affected by typhoons from the west.3. On October 18 2010. Typhoon Juan made landfall over Isabela By noon of the same day, it passed through the Sierra Madre Mountain Range. Later during the day, the typhoon hit the South China Sea. If you are to illustrate what will happen to the typhoon given these situations, which is the correct explanation?a. Typhoon Juan is expected to gain intensity as it approaches the Sierra Madre Mountains. It will eventually weaken and dissipate over the South China Sea.b. Typhoon Juan is expected to weaken as it passes the Sierra Madre Mountains. When it hits the South China, it is expected to gain intensityc. Typhoon Juan will continue to gain strength as it passes through the different areas within the Philippine Area of Responsibilityd. Typhoon Juan will weaken and eventually dissipate as it goes out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility4. How do landmasses affect typhoon?a. Landmasses increases the temperature as it goes up from a high mountainb. Landmasses lessen the strength of typhoons anytime the winds impact them. c. Landmasses lessen the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. d. Landmasses increases the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. 5. How do bodies of water affect typhoon? a Typhoon gain energy from warm ocean water and lose energy over cold water b. Typhoon gain energy from cold ocean water and lose energy over warm water c. Typhoon is affected by bodies of water because its wind speed was stronger after it made landfall in the island or mountain d. Typhoon is affected by bodies of water because its wind speed was lessened before it made landfall in the island or mountain but it increases after passed through island,​</a>

Why do tropical cyclones only form over the sea?
А. The flat sea surface allows sufficiently strong winds to develop.
B.
Their energy comes from the release of sensible heat when clouds are formed over the
water sources
C С
Their energy comes from the release of latent heat when clouds are formed over water
sources
D The seas are found only in the tropics.
The equator is warmer than the poles. Why do the surface winds not blow directly from the
poles to the equator?
А
Because there are mountain ranges in the way
Because the oceans deflect the air flow
Because of Earth's rotation
Because hot air rises

The wind speed of the typhoon becomes weakerc. The wind speed of the typhoon becomes strongerd. The wind capacity of the typhoon becomes stronger 2 Meria noticed that when typhoons came from the west, they barely get affected by such weather systems. But when typhoons originate from the east, they would almost always be dealing with strong winds and sometimes foods. Their village in General Santos City is sandwiched by a mountain range 2 kilometers fre the west and by the sea which is about a kilometer away what can explain her observations?a. Meria is mistaken as typhoons in tropical countries would always follow a west to east routeb. Typhoons cannot possibly originate west of their village as there is no body of water from that directionc. Cold air produced by trees from the mountains weakens the incoming typhoon headed towards the villaged. Mountains have the ability to deflect bodies of air, thus, Meria's village is not affected by typhoons from the west.3. On October 18 2010.

Typhoon Juan is expected to weaken as it passes the Sierra Madre Mountains. When it hits the South China, it is expected to gain intensityc.

Typhoon Juan will weaken and eventually dissipate as it goes out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility4. How do landmasses affect typhoon?a. Landmasses increases the temperature as it goes up from a high mountainb. Landmasses lessen the strength of typhoons anytime the winds impact them. c. Landmasses lessen the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. d. Landmasses increases the strength of typhoons whenever the winds impact them. 5. How do bodies of water affect typhoon? a Typhoon gain energy from warm ocean water and lose energy over cold water b. Typhoon gain energy from cold ocean water and lose energy over warm water c. Typhoon is affected by bodies of water because its wind speed was stronger after it made landfall in the island or mountain d. Typhoon is affected by bodies of water because its wind speed was lessened before it made landfall in the island or mountain but it increases after passed through island,​</h2><br />

Why do tropical cyclones only form over the sea?
А. The flat sea surface allows sufficiently strong winds to develop.
B.
Their energy comes from the release of sensible heat when clouds are formed over the
water sources
C С
Their energy comes from the release of latent heat when clouds are formed over water
sources
D The seas are found only in the tropics.
The equator is warmer than the poles. Why do the surface winds not blow directly from the
poles to the equator?
А
Because there are mountain ranges in the way
Because the oceans deflect the air flow
Because of Earth's rotation
Because hot air rises
B
C
D</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Tropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. ctto. Hanapin mo na lang kapair</p><br />
