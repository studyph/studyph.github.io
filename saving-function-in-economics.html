___1. Productivity is the output produced by a unit of factor input during a given span of time.
___2. The theory of production describes the functional relationships of output and economic resources, assuming these are of fixed size.
___3. Improvement in productivity can be seen if the ratio of output over input increases since a unit of input can produce more of the same output.
___4. A production function illustrates the varied combinations of inputs at the same level of plant capacity.
___5. Diseconomies of scale are the negative sloping portion of a long-run average cost curve.
___6. The Law of Diminishing Returns describes the tendency at some point for each succeeding addition to output to become smaller as the firms add succession units of variable input to some fixed inputs.
___7.An isoquant map contains infinite combinations of resource inputs that the same budget can purchase given constant prices.
___8. The AP and MP of a production function may shift downward or upward only because the overall productivity level of that firm may also change. Computers and computerized machineries are means of improving overall
___9.efficiency by utilizing resource-saving technology.
____10. Returns to scale are the indicator of plant-size change of a given business firm.
___11. MRS measures the price of labor inputs over the price of capital outputs. 
___12. Output yielded from the last unit of input is marginal product.
___14. The quotient from dividing TP by the number of variable inputs is average product.

As there has been an increase in the consumption of water, the need to conserve itarises even more. In other words, we need to come up with strategies and activities thati will help conserve water.(6) ["To begin with"], water conservation is important for future generations.(7) ["Moreover"], it will also help in reducing the level of used energy. Most importantly, aswater is home to millions of aquatic animals and plants, we need to save it to save aquaticlife.(8) ["Firstly"], we must all become more economical with our use of water. That meanswe must regulate how we use it and in what amount while performing daily tasks. (9) ["For instance"], we can opt for low-flow showerheads and toilets, automatic faucets, and similarsmart devices which aim to conserve water.(10) ["Similarly"], we can do our bit by not keeping the water running when brushingour teeth. (11)["Further"], we must also avoid showers and use a bucket instead to bathe.Similarly, we must all fix and leaking taps or more to avoid wastage of water.(12)["Apart from that"], we also have the issue of water pollution. (13)["So"], we musttake measures to curb that as well. The goverment must regulate the industries whichemit their industrial waste in water bodies, making it unfit for use and aquatic life.(14) ["To sum it up"], humans can survive without almost anything but water. As any! other resource gets exhausted, we may be able to prevent the negative impact of it.(15)["However"], if we consume all or pollute all the water, the damage will be irreversible."​</a>
