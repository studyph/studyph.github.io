I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.

And all my dreams but in vain;

                            3. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.
1. Describe the persona. What is he or she yearning for?
2. How does the poem describe the land of Africa? What does this imply about the feelings
of the persona?
3. What figures of speech are present in the poem? What do they mean?
4. What is the overall theme and message of the poem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.  The persona in the poem is a person who is longing to return to Africa, their homeland. The persona misses the beauty and culture of Africa, and yearns to experience it again.</p><p></p><p>2.  The poem describes Africa as a place of natural beauty, with forests, streams, and mountain passes. The persona fondly remembers the sounds of village dances and the music of the fiddle and fife. This implies that the persona has strong feelings of nostalgia and longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>3.  The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,

For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

                        <strong>A MILLION DREAMS </strong><p>a. I think the singer saw that he sees a <strong>world </strong>where he can all his aspirations and hopes in life.He imagines a <strong>world</strong> in which he is free, contented, and surrounded by those he loves. He visualizes a world in which anything is possible and he may fully live his life. In other words, he sees a multitude of dreams that are all within his reach.</p><strong>b.Brightest colors mean</strong>The lyrics "Every night I lie in bed, the brightest colors fill my head" from the song "A Million Dreams" perhaps refer to the vivid and lively dreams that the singer has at night. The boldest colors can represent the singer's enthusiasm and hope for his goals and desires. It might also be a symbol for his desire to escape his existing situation and the routine of his everyday existence. The use of vivid colors in this line inspires amazement and imagination, indicating that the singer's visions are rich with potential and possibilities.c.Dark in the song representsThe singer's struggles and difficulties in life are perhaps represented by the "black" in the song. His dreams and reality are at odds with each other because of the difference between the "brightest colors" that fill his thoughts at night and the blackness that he experiences during the day. The darkness can stand in for the challenges he must face in order to realize his goals, such as poverty, social constraints, or anxieties about himself. The song emphasizes the capacity of optimism and imagination to overcome challenging circumstances and forge a better future by contrasting the darkness with the vivid colors of his dreams.d.Issues/Fears about life that the speaker confronting in the songThe song conveys a message of optimism and tenacity in the face of adversity while capturing the hardships and fears that many people experience when attempting to realize their aspirations.In the song some issues that confront the speaker are the fear of failure, poverty, social barriers and loneliness.E. Attitude/characteristic the singer showThe attitude/ characteristics the singer show is hopeful and optimistic attitude that despite of the challenges in life and fears he faces. the singer still embodies a positive and proactive attitude towards life. The singer is not contented with his current circumstances  and is willing to take risk and make changes to create a better future himself.f. Importance to have dreamsCertainly, having dreams in life is vital because they provide us hope, purpose, and inspiration. Dreams motivate us to follow our passions, face obstacles head-on, and realize our greatest potential.g. Actions to reach my dreamsTo pursue my dreams in life the following are the steps that I take: First, I will accept the other people negative opinion as a truth. I would make an effort to alter my viewpoint and see their remark as a challenge to disprove them.I will evaluate my goals in life, I will seek feedback from the people I trust.I will focus on self improvement  and surround myself with positive influences.h. Interpreting the songThe song "A Million Dreams" is about the ability of hope and creativity to get through challenging situations and accomplish one's goals. Despite difficulties including poverty and social restrictions, the singer—a young boy—dreams of a better life that is vibrant and exciting. The song exhorts listeners to hold on to their hopes and to trust in the ability of hope and imagination to change the world and build a better future.2. Lecture on how to interpret a songThere are a few important factors to take into account when figuring out what a song's message is. The first is the song's context. At the time the song was composed, what was going on in the world or the artist's life? This can offer crucial hints about what the song may be about.The definitions of the words used in the lyrics should then be viewed. Understanding the intended meaning of words is crucial because sometimes the artist will use them in a non-literal manner.It is important to consider the main themes and interests of the song, as well as the message the artist is trying to convey and any recurring patterns or themes. Once these elements have been taken into account, one can start to develop an interpretation of the song. This could involve looking at the lyrics from a broad perspective to identify any underlying themes or messages, or examining the music itself to see how the melody and instrumentation contribute to the overall mood and atmosphere of the song.3.
