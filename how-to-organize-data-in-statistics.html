                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first thing to do with numerical data is to organize it into a frequency table. Each column of a frequency table generates (is used to create) a particular graph or chart. The width of each class is 5 (size of each class). The lower limits are the smaller numbers of each class (50, 55, 60, 65, 70, etc.)</p><br />

The different ways to gather statistical data are nominal data, ordinal data, interval data and ratio data.</p><p>3. In organizing a data  just use frequency distribution or cumulative frequency.</p><p>4. Central Tendency -  three ways to describe a set of data (Mean, Median, Mode)</p><p>5.
