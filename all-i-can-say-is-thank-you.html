                                            Taken by (One direction) 
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Thank you for showing me
Who you are underneath
No, thank you, I don't need
Another heartless misery
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you anymore
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me</a>

Life is a race, they say
It's a matter of time 
and you'll be born
then you'll die.
We all came from a bunch of sperm 
They said, swim till you can
So I did
Then I met an egg
She said thanks
After a while we became a zygote
In a matter of 9 months 
I was born into human form.
When I was born 
They did something to make me cry
They said it's for my sake.
Walang sense Hehe. Just say hi, or just pinpoint my mistakes, i'll be fine. Thank you for reading. Sorry for wasting your time. .</a>

You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Thank you for showing me
Who you are underneath
No, thank you, I don't need
Another heartless misery
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you anymore
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me</h2><br />

Life is a race, they say
It's a matter of time 
and you'll be born
then you'll die.
We all came from a bunch of sperm 
They said, swim till you can
So I did
Then I met an egg
She said thanks
After a while we became a zygote
In a matter of 9 months 
I was born into human form.
When I was born 
They did something to make me cry
They said it's for my sake.

                            28. Peter John Hey! What's up? You looked so worried! I am not okay. I am struggling about my Mathematics subject. I know Mathematics is difficult but I believe you can cope with it I really found it so hard this time. Peter John Peter Why? Is there anything wrong? My mother is in the hospital due to bleeding. Thanks a lot for your John concern. Peter You're welcome! Count on me! 1. What is the conversation all about? Why do you say so?​ 2.Does John have a problem? What is it?3.If you were John, would you feel the same? Why? 4.How can you help John solve his problem?​ 5. what kind of a friend is peter? kahit yung 5 na lang mga ssob ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> The conversation is about helping a friend. I say so because it is self-explanatory and it is obvious based on the subject they're talking about.yes, john has a problem. He's currently having a hard time on his mathematics subject.(the question seems lacking? i need more accuracy) if i were john, yes, i would be feeling the same way, the feeling of anxiousness and being unfocused, since the fact that my mother is in the hospital and my math subject is starting to get harder to the point where im struggling.i can help john solve his problem by saying positive things to him and also help him in his math subject where he is having a hard time on.Peter is the kind of friend who will always be there for you in times of need.<p></p><p>hope it helps:) pa brainliest pls:)</p><p></p><br />
