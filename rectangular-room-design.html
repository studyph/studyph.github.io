The Living room is one of the most visible areas of the house used by both visitors and family members. 12. Typically, a traffic pattern will begin at the back door of the space and continue through to a secondary door or entry into another room. 13. Because the bedroom is one of the simplest rooms in the house, it's often overlooked. 14. The primary tasks in a home kitchen are carried out between the cook top, the sink, and the dining table. 15. For square living rooms, a square or circular arrangement is the best choice. 16. In a scale 1:100, 1 meter is equal to 1 cm in a ruler. 17. The kitchen work triangle theory suggests that by placing two areas of the kitchen in proximity to each other, it becomes more efficient. 18. When designing a bathroom, the key is to look beyond this space. 19. Rhythm and flow in a room layout is achieved when occupants of the space transverse the space efficiently. 20.

You are one of the contractors asked to design and estimate the cost of their house with a masters bedroom one guest room, kitchen, bathroom and a non-separate living room and dining room area. How should the parts of the house be arranged and what are their dimensions? If they only want you concrete the outside walls and use jalousies for the windows, want is the rough cost estimate in a building the house?pa help po magkano yung ma cocost base sa estimation nyo po. asap po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Based on the given information, here's a proposed layout for the one-storey house with a 49-square-meter floor area:</p><p></p><p>Master Bedroom: 3.5m x 4m</p><p>Guest Room: 3m x 3m</p><p>Kitchen: 2.5m x 2.5m</p><p>Bathroom: 2m x 2m</p><p>Living Room and Dining Room (combined): 4.5m x 5m</p><p>The total floor area of the proposed layout is 49 square meters, which meets the requirement set by the couple.</p><p></p><p>As for the arrangement of the parts of the house, the Master Bedroom and Guest Room are located on one side of the house, with the bathroom located nearby for convenience. The Kitchen is situated on the opposite side of the house, and the Living Room and Dining Room are combined into one open space, creating a larger common area for leisure and entertaining.</p><p></p><p>For the dimensions, the room sizes provided above are approximate and can be adjusted based on the specific needs and preferences of the couple.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the couple only wants concrete for the outside walls and jalousies for the windows, the rough cost estimate for building the house will depend on various factors such as the location, labor costs, materials used, and design features. However, a rough estimate for a basic house with the proposed layout and specifications could range from $30,000 to $50,000 USD, excluding any additional costs for permits, utilities, and interior finishes. It's always recommended to consult with a professional contractor and obtain detailed quotes for accurate cost estimates</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>if it's on phillipines currency just tell in the comments </p><p></p><br />

Thank you for answering..</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1To get the minimum number of cans needed to paint the ceiling, we will divide the area of the ceiling (in square meters ) by the number of cans needed to paint per square meter.
</p><p>
</p><p>(a) Let's find the area of the ceiling.
</p><p>It is rectangular in shape, so we use the formula ×
