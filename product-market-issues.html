                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Product:</strong><strong> </strong>Coin Tube
</p><p><strong>Premise: </strong>Jeepneys are the general transportation for the Filipino mass. The custom of paying however makes the prevention of getting the virus harder. It’s because passengers have to pass their fare from hand to hand. So, having a coin tube solves that problem. The concept of Coin Tube is a two-way in which passengers can  slip coins into the tube and will exit into the driver’s cash box.  </p><p>Coin Tube can also be in the form of card. Before passengers load into a public transportation, passengers can tap into a screen to pay for their fare.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Business Name:</strong> Coin Tube
</p><p><strong>Target Market: </strong>Passengers for jeepneys, taxi cabs, tricycles, buses,and public vans. General Public.
</p><p><strong>Capital: </strong>For the prototype, it might need a few ten thousand of pesos. It needs to be patented, too.
</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> A price for the technology will cost P2,500.00 
</p><p><strong>Contemporary Economic Issues: </strong>Since the target market is the general Filipino mass and most of them are unable to afford the technology. However, there are forms of payments that can be offered.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12232433</p><br />
