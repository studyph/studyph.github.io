                                            Narrative 2: ―We are in a different war with COVID-19. This is not like ISIS where we can see the enemy,said Dr. Alicia Macmac, rural health unit officer in Lumba Bayabao, Lanao Del Sur. The impact of the Marawi City siege in 2017, an armed conflict between Philippine government forces and ISIL-affiliated militants, aggravated the poverty situation in Lanao del Sur, which is the poorest province in the country. More than 17,000 Maranao people displaced by the conflict remain in temporary shelters in the province. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased their vulnerability on top of the ongoing humanitarian situation. Dr. Macmac and other health care workers face enormous pressure to stop COVID-19 infections. As government-run hospitals face shortages of critical supplies to help contain the spread of the virus, UNICEF is providing disinfection supplies, tents, personal protective equipment, and infection prevention and control training for community health workers, sanitary engineers, and inspectors. 1.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

Jack loved swimming and he was good at it. So good, in fact, that he hoped to swim on the U.S. Olympic team. While training for the Olympics, however, he hurt his leg. Jack was not allowed to swim for at least one month. He spent the first few weeks moping and sitting around all day. The doctor told Jack that special exercises would help the leg heal more quickly. At first, Jack was so unhappy that he didn't do the exercises. One day his coach came to visit. Jack never told anyone what his coach told him, but it must have impressed him.

                                            This is not a Question I just want to help who need to find the plot of train to busan, you can see here too the main characters Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies. Once regrouped, they struggle through the horde to the front car, where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. However, the homeless man steps on a soda can, alerting the zombies to their location, and Seok-woo and Sang-hwa attempt to hold off the zombies, but Sang-hwa is bitten. At Yon-suk's instigation, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to enter the car by force by allowing all the zombies to eat him. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the vestibule. However, Jong-gil – disgusted at the passengers' selfishness and despairing the loss of her sister, who has become a zombie – allows the zombies to enter and kill them all. And because the other passengers had forced Seok-woo's group to isolate, his group remains safe. Yon-suk also escapes by hiding in the bathroom with a train attendant, with the survivors breaking off into groups, with Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, Jin-hee, Yong-guk, and the homeless man in one group, and Yon-suk, and the final train attendant in the otherA blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk pushes Jin-hee, the train captain, and the train attendant to the zombies to save himself and Jin-hee is bitten. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. Meanwhile, a flaming locomotive derails and the survivors are trapped under a train full of zombies. As the zombies drop by breaking the windows, the homeless man sacrifices himself so that Seok-woo has time to save Su-an and Seong-kyeong through a small hole under the derailed train. Realizing that there is a locomotive that still works, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, and Su-an narrowly avoid the zombies, and the three board the working locomotive and encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo manages to throw him off the train, but is bitten in the process. He teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his sobbing daughter, throwing himself off the train before he turns into a zombie. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong stop at a tunnel. They continue following the tracks on foot. Snipers stationed on the other side prepare to shoot at what they believe to be zombies. Upon hearing Su-an sobbing and singing "Aloha ʻOe" for her father, they lower their weapons, realizing the pair are human, as they help get them to safety.​</a>

This is not like ISIS where we can see the enemy,said Dr. Alicia Macmac, rural health unit officer in Lumba Bayabao, Lanao Del Sur. The impact of the Marawi City siege in 2017, an armed conflict between Philippine government forces and ISIL-affiliated militants, aggravated the poverty situation in Lanao del Sur, which is the poorest province in the country. More than 17,000 Maranao people displaced by the conflict remain in temporary shelters in the province. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased their vulnerability on top of the ongoing humanitarian situation. Dr. Macmac and other health care workers face enormous pressure to stop COVID-19 infections. As government-run hospitals face shortages of critical supplies to help contain the spread of the virus, UNICEF is providing disinfection supplies, tents, personal protective equipment, and infection prevention and control training for community health workers, sanitary engineers, and inspectors. 1.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

In this time of pandemic, almost everyone encountered difficulty in handling their "new normal" lifestyle. Please read the story of a persuasive athlete and how he handled his problem. Jack loved swimming and he was good at it. So good, in fact, that he hoped to swim on the U.S. Olympic team. While training for the Olympics, however, he hurt his leg. Jack was not allowed to swim for at least one month. He spent the first few weeks moping and sitting around all day. The doctor told Jack that special exercises would help the leg heal more quickly. At first, Jack was so unhappy that he didn't do the exercises. One day his coach came to visit. Jack never told anyone what his coach told him, but it must have impressed him. From that day on, he did the exercises. Let's Talk About These: 1. What was the setting of the story? 2. Who were the characters? 3. What was the conflict of the story? 4. How did the story end? 5. What was the author's purpose for telling the story?​</h2><br />

                            24. This is not a Question I just want to help who need to find the plot of train to busan, you can see here too the main characters Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His little daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing "Aloha ʻOe" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to indulge Su-an's wish. They board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, en route to Busan. Other passengers include working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, selfish COO Yon-suk, a high school baseball team, including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. As the train departs, an infected woman boards, becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train. Seok-woo learns that the zombie plague started at a factory connected to his business, and selfishly plans to use his connections to get to safety.The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Reports make it known that an epidemic is spreading across the country. After the train stops at Daejeon Station, where an army post is rumored to be housed the surviving passengers find that all the personnel stationed there are infected by the virus, and Seok-woo figures it out himself when a soldier is completely overrun by the infected. The surviving passengers manage to make it back on the train, but Sang-hwa, Seok-woo, Yong-guk, and two surviving baseball players get stuck closing the door. Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man manage to get on, but they find out that they are in the crosshairs of zombies, and they hide inside a bathroom. Meanwhile. Seok-woo's team manages to close the door, but the glass door shatters, and in the process of running, only Yong-guk, Sang-hwa, and Seok-woo manage to get on the train, with the two baseball players becoming infected. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, and the conductor heads the train there.Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk, who have become separated from their loved ones in a different car, use Yong-guk's baseball bat, riot gear, and hand-to-hand combat to fight their way to them through the zombies. Once regrouped, they struggle through the horde to the front car, where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. However, the homeless man steps on a soda can, alerting the zombies to their location, and Seok-woo and Sang-hwa attempt to hold off the zombies, but Sang-hwa is bitten. At Yon-suk's instigation, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to enter the car by force by allowing all the zombies to eat him. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the vestibule. However, Jong-gil – disgusted at the passengers' selfishness and despairing the loss of her sister, who has become a zombie – allows the zombies to enter and kill them all. And because the other passengers had forced Seok-woo's group to isolate, his group remains safe. Yon-suk also escapes by hiding in the bathroom with a train attendant, with the survivors breaking off into groups, with Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, Jin-hee, Yong-guk, and the homeless man in one group, and Yon-suk, and the final train attendant in the otherA blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk pushes Jin-hee, the train captain, and the train attendant to the zombies to save himself and Jin-hee is bitten. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. Meanwhile, a flaming locomotive derails and the survivors are trapped under a train full of zombies. As the zombies drop by breaking the windows, the homeless man sacrifices himself so that Seok-woo has time to save Su-an and Seong-kyeong through a small hole under the derailed train. Realizing that there is a locomotive that still works, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, and Su-an narrowly avoid the zombies, and the three board the working locomotive and encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie. Seok-woo manages to throw him off the train, but is bitten in the process. He teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his sobbing daughter, throwing himself off the train before he turns into a zombie. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong stop at a tunnel. They continue following the tracks on foot.
