Ability is defined as in many ways like it the power to do things well which includes
knowledge and skills, an individual's capacity to perform different tasks and the mental or
physical power or skill needed to do something. Ability also means a special talent and skills
of a person.
There are two general types of ability.
Intellectual Abilities that require doing mental activities like critical thinking.

endurance, agility, strength, and similar characteristics.
Knowing that we have a particular ability is not enough we must improve our ability by
practicing and be a person that has the open mind to learn new things. At this point of time,
you need to discover the ability that you have to match the future career and practice and be
open to new ideas and learn from the experts.

                                            Many students are discouraged when they do problem solving. They feel inadequate to understand the problem and solve it. More often, it is not our lack of ability, but our own faintheartedness that stops us from accomplishing our goals. Determination means having the courage to accomplish one's goals, regardless of the difficulties. Problem solving is simply an application of the concepts that one has learned. Do you think it is better to avoid problems whenever can one or to face them head-on?​</a>
