                                            ASSESSMENT 2c: Those 21st century literary genres are very much complemented by if not dependent on technology. Instead of the printed “pocketbooks” that your elders used to buy from the sidewalks at the University Belt or from a popular bookstore, your generation just download or read an e-book online. Instead of buying vinyl records of your grandparents' favorite Kundiman singers, your peer would just log-on to music-sharing sites and listen to a variety of music at a click of a gadget. Themes have also adjusted to the moods, whims, and preferences of present-day youth. The manner by which friendship was forged and courtship was conducted in the olden days would not appeal to you and your contemporaries. Lyrics of presentday love songs will reflect that as well as scenes from films that depict present-day ways of life. Consider the Tanaga of old. Its younger counterpart would be the Text Tula (see definition above) which became a trend when everyone started getting a mobile phone device. How would you write a few lines of poetry of your own? How would they differ from the rhyme, sound, density, and theme of the old? Write your own Text Tula on a drawing of a mobile phone screen on your paper. ​</a>

                            25. ASSESSMENT 2c: Those 21st century literary genres are very much complemented by if not dependent on technology. Instead of the printed “pocketbooks” that your elders used to buy from the sidewalks at the University Belt or from a popular bookstore, your generation just download or read an e-book online. Instead of buying vinyl records of your grandparents' favorite Kundiman singers, your peer would just log-on to music-sharing sites and listen to a variety of music at a click of a gadget. Themes have also adjusted to the moods, whims, and preferences of present-day youth. The manner by which friendship was forged and courtship was conducted in the olden days would not appeal to you and your contemporaries. Lyrics of presentday love songs will reflect that as well as scenes from films that depict present-day ways of life. Consider the Tanaga of old. Its younger counterpart would be the Text Tula (see definition above) which became a trend when everyone started getting a mobile phone device. How would you write a few lines of poetry of your own? How would they differ from the rhyme, sound, density, and theme of the old? Write your own Text Tula on a drawing of a mobile phone screen on your paper. ​</h2><br />
