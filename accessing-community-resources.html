                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Committee hypothesizes that the burden of financing care for uninsured persons affects the health services available within the community, especially in urban areas where providers treat large numbers of uninsured persons and in rural areas where providers treat relatively high proportions of uninsured. The strategies taken may be different in rural and urban areas, but the Committee finds plausible the idea that providers in rural and urban settings respond to financial pressures related to uninsurance in similar ways. In an effort to avoid this burden or to minimize its impact on a provider’s bottom line, services may be cut back, relocated, or closed. Staffing may be reduced. This may further strain the capacities of already overcrowded hospital emergency departments, and physicians’ offices or even hospitals may be relocated away from areas of town or entire communities that have concentrations of uninsured persons. Such disruptions may reduce people’s access to care and the quality of care they receive, regardless of their insurance status.</p><br />

                         EFFECT:<p></p><p>Committee hypothesizes that the burden of financing care for uninsured persons affects the health services available within the community, especially in urban areas where providers treat large numbers of uninsured persons and in rural areas where providers treat relatively high proportions of uninsured. The strategies taken may be different in rural and urban areas, but the Committee finds plausible the idea that providers in rural and urban settings respond to financial pressures related to uninsurance in similar ways. In an effort to avoid this burden or to minimize its impact on a provider’s bottom line, services may be cut back, relocated, or closed. Staffing may be reduced. This may further strain the capacities of already overcrowded hospital emergency departments, and physicians’ offices or even hospitals may be relocated away from areas of town or entire communities that have concentrations of uninsured persons. Such disruptions may reduce people’s access to care and the quality of care they receive, regardless of their insurance status.</p><p></p><p></p>kung gusto mo ng maikle ang iyong susulatin:<p> </p><p>affects the health services available within the community, especially in urban areas where providers treat large numbers of uninsured persons and in rural areas where providers treat relatively high proportions of uninsured.</p><p></p><p>(pero mas maganda pag mahaba sagot mo para mataas grades)</p><p></p><p>hopithepls</p><br />
