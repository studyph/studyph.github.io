For example, a beech-maple forest will contain a population a population of other species of plants and animals. All the plant and animal populations living and interacting in given environment are known as community. The living community and the nonliving environment work together in a cooperative ecological system known as ecosystem. An ecosystem has no size requirement or set boundaries. A forest, a pond and a field are examples of ecosystems. So is an unused city lot, a small aquarium, the lawn in front of a residential dwelling, or a crack inside walk All these examples reflect areas where interaction is taking place between living organism and the nonliving environment. 30.

                        <p>Estuaries provide us with a wide range of resources, benefits, and services. 
</p><p>Estuaries provide places for habitat of valuable species of plants and animals, 
</p><p>recreational activities, scientific study, important centers for transportation, 
</p><p>and international commerce. Estuaries are irreplaceable natural resources 
</p><p>that must be managed carefully for the mutual benefit of all who enjoy and 
</p><p>demand on them.
</p><p>• Estuaries rank among the most productive ecosystems on earth, but 
</p><p>they are also subject to considerable ecological degradation associated with the 
</p><p>loss and alteration of habitats and impairment of water quality due to multiple 
</p><p>anthropogenic and natural drivers of change
</p><p>• Escalating population growth, urban and industrial development, 
</p><p>modification of coastal watersheds and estuarine basins, pollution inputs, and 
</p><p>overharvest of recreational and commercial species can threaten the system 
</p><p>structure and function and the sustainability of the system resources.
</p><p>• Putting coconut fiber mat, planting marsh grass, and Mussels bed are 
</p><p>some activities that protect our estuaries and intertidal environment.</p><p></p><p>Why is the Intertidal Zone Important?
</p><p>The intertidal or littoral zone maintains a balance between the land and the 
</p><p>sea. It provides a home to specially adapted marine plants and animals. Those 
</p><p>organisms, in turn, serve as food for many other animals.
</p><p>The intertidal zone also staves off erosion caused by storms. Oyster reefs are 
</p><p>one such example of a protective feature. This helps protect the structures built 
</p><p>by people.
</p><p>The intertidal zone is also an important indicator for climate change on marine 
</p><p>organisms.
</p><p>The intertidal zone is a delicate ecosystem, threatened by rising sea levels due 
</p><p>to climate change. Development by humans threatens the intertidal zone as 
</p><p>well.
</p><p>Changes in temperature due to climate change also threaten the organisms 
</p><p>outright. 
</p><p>The intertidal zone is also susceptible to pollution and trash. When you explore a 
</p><p>beach, rocky shores or tide pools, leave shells for the hermit crabs. Collect any 
</p><p>trash you see. Volunteer to help conserve this fascinating ecosystem.
</p><p>• Estuaries serve as the breeding ground of organisms that play a vital role 
</p><p>in the balance of nature.
</p><p>• There are so many ways in protecting and conserving our estuaries but 
</p><p>the simplest and easiest way to conserve is to conserve water and native 
</p><p>plants which do not require fertilizers.
</p><p>• According to study, the economy of many coastal areas is based primarily 
</p><p>on the natural beauty and bounty of estuaries. When those natural 
</p><p>resources are imperiled, so are the livelihoods of those who live and work 
</p><p>in estuarine watersheds.
</p><p>• The use of fertilizers, sewage from falling septic tanks, pet waste, 
</p><p>wastewater discharge from industrial facilities, sediment from construction 
</p><p>sites, and the rapid increase in population are the main reasons that 
</p><p>makes estuarine system imbalance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 true</p><p>2.true</p><p>3.false</p><p>4.true</p><p>5.true</p><p>6.false</p><p>7.false</p><p>8.true</p><p>9.true</p><p>10.true</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>tama po iyan </p><p>ihope its help</p><p>carry on learing </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.An ecosystem is all the living things, from plants and animals to microscopic organisms, that share an environment. Everything in an ecosystem has an important role. Well, almost everything.<p></p>2.A natural ecosystem is the result of interactions between organisms and the environment. For example, an ocean is classified as a marine ecosystem, which consists of algae, consumers and decomposers<p></p>3.An ecosystem, which is created and maintained by human beings, is called artificial or man- made ecosystem. Some examples of man- made ecosystem are aquarium, garden, agriculture, apiary, poultry, piggery etc.<p></p>4.In biology and ecology, abiotic components or abiotic factors are non-living chemical and physical parts of the environment that affect living organisms and the functioning of ecosystems.<p></p>5.Biotic components are living organisms in an ecosystem. A biotic factor is a living organism that affects another organism in its ecosystem. Examples include plants and animals that the organism consumes as food, and animals that consume the organism.<p></p>6.Producers are organisms that make their own food; they are also known as autotrophs. They get energy from chemicals or the sun, and with the help of water, convert that energy into useable energy in the form of sugar, or food.<p></p>7.A consumer in a food chain is a living creature that eats organisms from a different population. A consumer is a heterotroph and a producer is an autotroph. Both are organisms that obtain energy from other living things.<p></p>8.Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms; they carry out decomposition, a process possible by only certain kingdoms, such as fungi.<p></p>9.A living thing pertains to any organism or a life form that possesses or shows the characteristics of life or being alive. <p></p>10.A non-living thing in biology means any form without life, such as an inanimate body or object. Compared with the entity that has life, a non-living thing lacks the features that characterize a living thing.<p></p>11.Mutualism describes the ecological interaction between two or more species where each species has a net benefit. Mutualism is a common type of ecological interaction.<p></p>12.commensalism, in biology, a relationship between individuals of two species in which one species obtains food or other benefits from the other without either harming or benefiting the latter.<p></p>13.Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey. It is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation and parasitoidism<p></p>14.Parasitism is a close relationship between species, where one organism, the parasite, lives on or inside another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life.<p></p>15.an animal hunted or seized for food, especially by a carnivorous animal.<p></p>16.an animal that lives by killing and eating other animals : an animal that preys on other animals.<p></p>17.Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction in which members of one species gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed. <p></p>18.the act or process of trying to get or win something (such as a prize or a higher level of success) that someone else is also trying to get or win : the act or process of competing.<p></p>19.A carnivore, meaning "meat eater", is an animal whose food and energy requirements derive solely from animal products whether through hunting or scavenging.<p></p>20.A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet.<p></p>21.An omnivore is an organism that eats plants and animals. The term stems from the Latin words omnis, meaning “all or everything,” and vorare, meaning “to devour or eat.”<p></p>22.An insectivore is a carnivorous plant or animal that eats insects. An alternative term is entomophage, which can also refer to the human practice of eating insects. The first vertebrate insectivores were amphibians. <p></p>B.Examples of Biotic components1.Aquatic plant2.Fish3.Algae4.Deer5.AmphibiansExamples of Abiotic components6.Water7.Temperature8.Sunlight9.Soil10.Atmosphere<p></p>Examples of consumers11.Omnivores12.Carnivores13.Herbivores14.Decomposers15.Producers<p></p>Examples of producer16.Grass17.Moss18.Flowers19.Weeds20.Flowers<p></p>Examples of decomposers21.Bacteria22.Fungi23.Termite24.Mold25.Millipede<p></p>Examples of carnivores26.Felidae27.Canidae28.Bears29.Mustelids30.Hyenas<p></p>Examples of omnivores31.Humans32.Birds33.Dogs34.Raccoons35.Foxes<p></p>Examples of herbivores36.Squirrels37.Elk38.Cows39.Buffalo40.Rabbits<p></p>Examples of insectivores1.Frogs2.Carp3.Bats4.Spiders5.Pangolins<p></p><p></p>HOPE IT HELPS FOLLOW FOR MORE..<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Biteable, we like to think we know a thing or two about creating great video commercials and ads. For fun, we decided to pool together some of our favourite commercials of all time to provide inspiration for your next video ad.</p><p></p><p>What makes a great TV commercial or video ad?</p><p>Since the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, television advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured that video ads are more popular than ever.</p><p></p><p>So what does it take to make a good ad? Well, as you’ll see in the examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials share.</p><p></p><p>They’re memorable: From “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5000 advertising messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand identity.</p><p></p><p>They’re shareworthy: For maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.</p><p></p><p>They communicate the brand’s values: The best ads capture the brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch the ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”</p><p></p><p>Call to action: Lastly, an effective commercial makes it clear what it wants you to do next, whether it’s to visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.</p><p></p><p>Create your perfect video in minutes</p><p></p><p>Get started for free.</p><p></p><p>Make a video — it’s free!</p><p>Funniest Commercials</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad can grab attention and inspire positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad can cause a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.</p><p></p><p>The key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative. Here are some of the most effective, and funniest commercials we’ve seen:</p><p></p><p>Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” (2010)</p><p>When Old Spice realized that women made the majority of purchasing decisions when it came to men’s body wash products, they took a different approach with their next campaign. While the tagline “don’t let your man smell like a woman,” might not fly these days, the genuinely funny non-sequitur dialogue and Isaiah Mustafa’s perfect delivery made it a massive hit.</p><p></p><p>Old Spice’s ad was perhaps the pinnacle of the absurdist, unpredictable, meme-able humor many advertisers have embraced, in hopes of creating a viral hit. And it worked. The ad took home nearly every major industry award that year and currently stands at over 55 million views on YouTube. Old Spice, meanwhile, has continued to hone their off-beat brand voice with a hugely popular follow-up campaign starring actor Terry Crews.</p><p></p><p>Reebok: “Terry Tate, Office Linebacker” (2003)</p><p>Slapstick violence: since the earliest days of comedy it’s been a foolproof way to make ‘em laugh. Reebok’s Super Bowl XXXVII ad had plenty, along with an amusing premise (boosting office productivity), an element of surprise, and solid one-liners and delivery.</p><p></p><p>The spot was roundly praised by critics and viewers alike that year, though whether it actually succeeded in boosting Reebok’s brand is questionable. According to one poll after it aired, just 55% of viewers recalled that the ad was affiliated with Reebok. Though Reebok considered it nonetheless a success, citing a 4-fold increase in online sales, it’s still a good reminder to consider whether misaligned subject matter may cause your ad to become a victim of the </p><br />
