                                            paraphrase the autobiograpy 
Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort.</a>

                                            You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text?

                            4. paraphrase the autobiograpy 
Born 1706 in Boston, Benjamin Franklin was the 15th of his father's 17 children. He went to school as a child with the intent of becoming a minister, as his father, Josiah, intended. However, that idea was dropped after Franklin showed a keen interest in reading and writing. He was apprenticed to his brother, James at a young age, but after fighting with his brother he quit the job and moved to Philadelphia, where he worked for a man named Samuel Keimer. After befriending some prominent political figures, including the royal Governor, Franklin left for England, where he spent 18 months working for a printer with his friend James Ralph, with whom he later became estranged. Shortly after returning to America in 1726, Franklin formed a debating club called the Junto. Two years later, he took over The Pennsylvania Gazette from Keimer and turned it into a successful publication with tools from London. In 1730, Franklin wed his old sweetheart, Deborah Read, with whom he had two children. The first, William Franklin, was born approximately one year later Throughout the 1730s, Franklin held some minor positions doing printing work for the government. In that time, he began Poor Richard's Almanac and became postmaster of Philadelphia. Towards the end of the decade, he invented the Franklin stove. In the 1740s, Franklin worked on several projects, including the fire brigade, the police force, the University of Pennsylvania, the street sweeping service and some other smaller public works projects. He retired from the printing business in 1748 and began to conduct scientific experiments in lightning. In 1753, he was awarded honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale, and he became Postmaster General of America. The following year, when war broke out between England and France (the French and Indian War Franklin began to draft proposals outlining means by which funds could be raised for colonial defense. He succeeded in many of his proposals, and he personally played a large part in organizing the war effort.</h2><br />

                            23. You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text? Support your answer with quotes from the text. Explain your quotes and your argument thoroughly.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One lesson that can be learned from the text is that inflation can have severe consequences on an economy and its people. The text provides a historical example of hyperinflation in Germany after World War I, where the value of their currency dropped rapidly, leading to skyrocketing prices of goods and services. As the text explains, "Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem" (paragraph 2).</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the text highlights the devastating effects of inflation on people's everyday lives, such as the need to buy basic items like bread and stamps for billions of Marks and the difficulty of figuring out expenses in thousands of billions. The text states, "Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills" (paragraph 5).</p><p></p><p>The text also suggests that a stable currency is crucial for a functioning economy and a better quality of life for people. The introduction of the new currency, the Retenmark, which was backed by land and gold and had a fixed rate of exchange, helped stabilize the German economy and restore confidence in their currency. The text notes, "By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable" (paragraph 7).</p><p></p><p>In summary, the text highlights the negative consequences of inflation, the importance of a stable currency, and the need for governments to manage their economies carefully to prevent hyperinflation and its disastrous effects on the lives of their citizens.</p><br />
