One day, one of her other children was crying because they have no enough food for everybody for weeks. As he was walking on the street, he saw his neighbor who insulted him for being too poor to support his family the other day. This neighbor left his wallet containing Php. 10,000.00 on the bench he was sitting. Upon seeing this, Jericho took the money but was worried as he thought that he was stealing.  Instructions: Think about all possible perspective that you can think about the situation. Test all the perspective you thought of by answering whether it is right for Jericho to take the money. Do not debate about which is the best perspective but critically evaluate each. Pick a perspective from your list and say why you choose this perspective.

Write the underlined words on your answer sheet. I am utterly fond of my lola's house. Its design is absolutely perfect inside and out, and I feel absolutely at home when I'm visiting. The exterior of the house is built entirely of stone. My favorite part of the house is the sunroom. The sunroom is rather cold in the winter, but in spring and fall it is simply divine. I really love sitting in the sunroom with my brothers and sisters and a hot cup of milk. The newly renovated kitchen is also a very splendid place to visit with the family. The kitchen has been under construction for quite some time, but by the looks of things, it seems to be nearly finished. This house would cost much more in the city, but because it's located in a small town, it was pretty reasonable.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I do not agree that it should be the women to do all of the household chores for her family. Traditional gender roles are outdated and it is unfair to expect that all of the burden of taking care of the home should fall upon one person, regardless of gender. It is important for both men and women to work together and share the responsibility for taking care of the home. There is value in all different kinds of work, and it is important to take part in whatever tasks need to be done at home, regardless of gender. By working as a team, both men and women can learn from each other, develop creative solutions to household problems, and appreciate each other’s contributions.</p><br />

                            8. Ponder about this situation. DISCUSS YOUR ANSWER.            Jericho is a construction worker and a father of two and her wife is pregnant. One of their children has leukemia and needs immediate treatment. Since the diagnosis almost all his earnings go to her medication. One day, one of her other children was crying because they have no enough food for everybody for weeks. As he was walking on the street, he saw his neighbor who insulted him for being too poor to support his family the other day. This neighbor left his wallet containing Php. 10,000.00 on the bench he was sitting. Upon seeing this, Jericho took the money but was worried as he thought that he was stealing.  Instructions: Think about all possible perspective that you can think about the situation. Test all the perspective you thought of by answering whether it is right for Jericho to take the money. Do not debate about which is the best perspective but critically evaluate each. Pick a perspective from your list and say why you choose this perspective. Remember to relate it to the given scenario​</h2><br />
                        In my opinion, it’s okay to steal the money. <br /><br />❗️❗️REASON❗️❗️:<br /><br />If Jericho took the money containing about Php 10,000,00 FOR feeding his pregnant wife and his (2) children including him, his stealing THEN includes a GOOD reason or cause. It can also be bad because of the part “UPON SEEING THIS, JERICHO TOOK THE MONEY BUT WAS WORRIED AS HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS STEALING”, Which could give him guilt. But for all, stealing is <br />“ALL RIGHT” because it has a good benefit in it. And THAT GOOD BENEFIT, can feed his (2) children, him and his pregnant wife.<br /><br /><br />I hope this give you an idea or i hope you found/find this helpful.

of three sisters and two brothers. As the eldest, he felt the burden of helping to meet the needs of his
family. When he was in Junior High School, he took a part-time job after class, in order to have an
additional income to support the needs of his family. He did it with permission from his parents and
started to work as balut vendor in the neighborhood, until he earned money to finance his own studies.
Through balut selling, he was able to provide some of their needs including school allowances. Joel’s
parents are proud and happy of his effort in helping them, and they always encourage him to do his best
in his studies. His other siblings are helping in the household chores and also in the assignment of his
younger siblings for they are looking forward to a better future.</h2><br />
