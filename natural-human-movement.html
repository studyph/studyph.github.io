                                            A new movement swept through Europe during the 18th century and created a progressive shift in culture, technology and art. As the world experienced the importance of scientific innovation for human development, the Age of Enlightenment was largely a response to the industrial Revolution. Europe dominated this period, inevitably birthing two major periods of philosophy and visual art. Side by side, Neoclassicism and Romanticism competed, in a reason to express passion and desire for classics. The key difference between neoclassicism and romanticism is that objectivity, rationality and intellect are the focal points of neoclassicism while human imagination, nature, and emotions or feelings are stressed by romanticism.​</a>
