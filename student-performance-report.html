Their duties include assigning homework, grading tests, and documenting progress. Teachers must be able to instruct in a variety of subjects and reach students with engaging lesson plans.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope can help</p><p>wala pang answer sa student</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>It really does depend on the subject matter, but I have been lucky enough to teach subject matter which is directly related to my clinical experience. I usually start my teaching with a personal experience related to the learning context, which often draws the students' attention. I then ask the students if they have had a similar event or experience and open the forum for discussion. In my experience, this method usually engages the student as they then see vocational relevance of their learning. It is not to say that this cannot be done for other areas of learning. Perhaps you could engage the students more by showing the relevance of their learning context in an area that they recognise as important in the future.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Sana po makatulong<p></p><br />

                        Reporting Students Performance
<p>Teachers must have accurate data about the grading system; student performance must be recorded base on its achievement and effort. A comprehensive report of grades to each learner must observe at all times. Teachers’ judgments reflect on learners’ capability and intelligence; therefore, critical evaluation on the given data must apply appropriately and honestly.
</p>
Tools and ways of reporting students’ performance
<strong>Parent-Teachers Meeting</strong>, this is the perfect time to report learners’ achievements; teachers and parents’ communication must be well presented and organized. The problems and conflicts must be discussed during the meeting; confidential information about the learners must be revealed to the authorized person only.
<strong>Student Portfolio</strong> is a collection of student’s output such as quizzes, examinations, oral examinations, and the likes. This is one of the effective ways to report learners’ achievements wherein student outputs were organized and filed accordingly.
Types of Assessment
<strong>Diagnostic Assessment</strong>, the aim of this evaluation was to know learners’ prior knowledge about the topic.
<strong>Formative Assessment</strong>, it aims was to identify learners’ understanding during the teaching-learning process.
<strong>Summative Assessment</strong>, this is the most important part of the evaluation in which the assessment intends to measure and validate learners’ understanding.
The following were the assessment tools used to provide precise information about student performance:
<strong>Multiple Choices</strong>, this is the use of pen and paper; the learners choose appropriate answers among the choices.
<strong>Project</strong>, this can be performance or output base; interpretation of grade must be assessed base on a reasonable scale.
<strong>Performance Examination</strong>, this is the actual demonstration of acquired knowledge and understanding; teachers must use rubric during the evaluation.
<strong>Rubric</strong>, is a tool used to measure accurately the students’ performance.

If a student is 12 year of age, what is his THR range?​nonsense = report thank you</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. To compute for the DBW-F of a regular student with a height of 5'5", we can use the formula:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>DBW-F = (Height in inches - 60) x 2.3 + 100</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Converting the height of 5'5" to inches, we have:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5 feet = 60 inches</strong></p><p><strong>0.5 feet = 6 inches</strong></p><p><strong>Total height = 60 + 6 = 66 inches</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Substituting the value in the formula:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>DBW-F = (66 - 60) x 2.3 + 100</strong></p><p><strong>DBW-F = 13.8 + 100</strong></p><p><strong>DBW-F = 113.8 lbs (pounds)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To compute for the Total Energy Requirement (TER), we can use the Harris-Benedict equation, which is:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>TER = BMR x PAL</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>where BMR is the basal metabolic rate and PAL is the physical activity level. For a regular student, we can assume a PAL of 1.6-1.7, which corresponds to light to moderate physical activity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To compute for BMR, we can use the following formula for males:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>BMR = 10 x weight (in kg) + 6.25 x height (in cm) - 5 x age + 5</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To convert the weight and height from pounds and inches to kilograms and centimeters, respectively:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Weight in kg = weight in lbs / 2.2046</strong></p><p><strong>Weight in kg = 113.8 / 2.2046</strong></p><p><strong>Weight in kg = 51.63 kg</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Height in cm = height in inches x 2.54</strong></p><p><strong>Height in cm = 66 x 2.54</strong></p><p><strong>Height in cm = 167.64 cm</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Assuming a 20-year-old student, we can compute for the BMR:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>BMR = 10 x 51.63 + 6.25 x 167.64 - 5 x 20 + 5</strong></p><p><strong>BMR = 1076.94 calories/day</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, substituting the values in the Harris-Benedict equation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>TER = 1076.94 x 1.6 to 1.7</strong></p><p><strong>TER = 1723.1 to 1837.8 calories/day</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Therefore, the Total Energy Requirement (TER) of the regular student with a height of 5'5" who performs light to moderate physical activities is approximately 1723 to 1838 calories/day.<br /></strong><br />2. The target heart rate (THR) range for a 12-year-old student during exercise depends on their age, resting heart rate, and level of physical activity. The general formula for calculating the THR range is:</p><p></p><p>THR = [(max HR − resting HR) × %Intensity] + resting HR</p><p></p><p>where max HR is the maximum heart rate, resting HR is the resting heart rate, and %Intensity is the desired exercise intensity (usually 50-85%).</p><p></p><p>To estimate the maximum heart rate, subtract the student's age from 220. For a 12-year-old student, the estimated maximum heart rate would be:</p><p></p><p>220 - 12 = 208 beats per minute (bpm)</p><p></p><p>Assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm and a desired exercise intensity of 60%, the THR range would be:</p><p></p><p>THR = [(208 - 70) × 0.6] + 70</p><p>THR = 148.8 bpm</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the THR range for a 12-year-old student with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm and a desired exercise intensity of 60% is approximately 149 bpm.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each person/thing we collect data on is called an OBSERVATION (in our work these are usually people/subjects. Currently, the term participant rather than subject is used when describing the people from whom we collect data).</p><p></p><p>OBSERVATIONS (participants) possess a variety of CHARACTERISTICS.</p><p></p><p>If a CHARACTERISTIC of an OBSERVATION (participant) is the same for every member of the group (doesn’t vary) it is called a CONSTANT.</p><p></p><p>If a CHARACTERISTIC of an OBSERVATION (participant) differs for group members it is called a VARIABLE. In research we don’t get excited about CONSTANTS (since everyone is the same on that characteristic); we’re more interested in VARIABLES. Variables can be classified as QUANTITATIVE or QUALITATIVE (also known as CATEGORICAL).</p><p></p><p>QUANTITATIVE variables are ones that exist along a continuum that runs from low to high. Ordinal, interval, and ratio variables are quantitative.  QUANTITATIVE variables are sometimes called CONTINUOUS VARIABLES because they have a variety (continuum) of characteristics. Height in inches and scores on a test would be examples of quantitative variables.</p><p></p><p>QUALITATIVE variables do not express differences in amount, only differences. They are sometimes referred to as CATEGORICAL variables because they classify by categories. Nominal variables such as gender, religion, or eye color are CATEGORICAL variables. Generally speaking, categorical variables</p><br />

When teachers provide regular feedback and progress reports to students, they are better able to understand where they need to improve and adjust their studying habits accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Here are some ways in which class reporting can be effective in improving academic performance:</p><p></p><p>Provides motivation: Students who receive regular feedback on their progress are more motivated to improve their academic performance. When they see areas where they are doing well, they are encouraged to continue to excel. Conversely, when they see areas where they are struggling, they are motivated to work harder and seek out additional resources and support.</p><p></p><p>Helps identify areas for improvement: Regular progress reports can help students identify areas where they need to improve. This can help them focus their studying efforts on the areas that need the most attention, leading to better performance in those areas.</p><p></p><p>Encourages communication: Class reporting also encourages communication between students and teachers. This communication can help students better understand the material and the expectations for the course, which can lead to better performance.</p><p></p><p>Allows for early intervention: Progress reports can also help teachers identify students who may be struggling early on in the course. This allows teachers to intervene early and provide additional support to help those students improve their performance before it's too late.</p><p></p><p>Overall, class reporting can be an effective tool for improving academic performance. By providing regular feedback and progress reports, teachers can motivate students, help them identify areas for improvement, encourage communication, and allow for early intervention.</p><p></p><p>Some specific questions that someone might ask about the title "The Effectiveness of Class Reporting to the Academic Performances of the Students" could include:</p><p></p><p>1.

                        ESSAY:<p><strong>The pandemic</strong> has brought about unprecedented changes in the way we live and learn. With the sudden shift to online learning, students and educators alike have had to adapt to this new mode of education. While there are certainly benefits to online learning, such as flexibility and access to a wider range of resources, it is undeniable that it has also had its fair share of challenges and negative impacts on students' behavior and scholastic performance.</p><p><strong>One of the main issues </strong>with online learning is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection, which can negatively affect students' motivation and engagement in their studies. In addition, the lack of in-person supervision can lead to a decrease in accountability and discipline, resulting in poor time management and decreased productivity.</p><p><strong>Another factor </strong>to consider is the unequal access to technology and reliable internet connection. While some students may have access to the necessary resources, others may not be as fortunate, leading to a digital divide that further hinders their learning. This can lead to a widening of the achievement gap between students, with those who are already disadvantaged suffering the most.</p><p><strong>Moreover</strong>, online learning can be overwhelming for some students, especially those who struggle with self-motivation or who have learning disabilities. The lack of structure and support can make it difficult for these students to keep up with their studies, leading to a decline in their grades.</p><p>I<strong>n conclusion</strong>, online learning has had both positive and negative effects on student behavior and scholastic performance. While it has provided flexibility and access to resources, it has also brought about challenges such as a lack of face-to-face interaction, unequal access to technology, and increased stress and difficulty for some students. It is important to address these challenges in order to provide a more equitable and effective learning experience for all students.</p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IT</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HELPS</strong><strong>!</strong><br />

                            26. Specific Question : The Effectiveness of Class Reporting to the Academic Performances of the Students.</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What is The Effectiveness of Class Reporting to the Academic Performances of the Students</p><p></p><p>Class reporting, when done properly, can have a positive impact on the academic performances of students. This is because class reporting provides students with an opportunity to actively engage in their learning by presenting their ideas, research, and understanding of a particular topic to their classmates and teachers. It also helps students develop their communication, presentation, and critical thinking skills.</p><p></p><p>Through class reporting, students are encouraged to do their own research and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This can lead to increased motivation, better retention of information, and improved academic performance. When students are given the chance to present their work and ideas to their peers, it also provides an opportunity for them to receive feedback and constructive criticism that can help them improve their work.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, class reporting can help students develop confidence in their abilities and foster a sense of belonging and community within the classroom. When students see their classmates presenting and sharing their work, it can inspire them to do the same and create a supportive learning environment.</p><p></p><p>However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of class reporting on academic performance depends on various factors such as the quality of instruction, the teacher's expectations, and the students' willingness to engage in the process. If class reporting is not implemented effectively, it may not have a significant impact on students' academic performance.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, class reporting can be an effective tool in improving students' academic performance, but it needs to be implemented properly and with clear objectives to maximize its benefits.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Technology helps students become independent, proficient member and researchers. ... Increased implementation of technology will increase students' comprehension of content and development of skills in such areas as analytical reasoning, problem solving, information evaluation, and creative thinking</p><p>The results are generally consistent with past research: Online coursework generally yields worse student performance than in-person coursework. The negative effects of online course-taking are particularly pronounced for less-academically prepared students and for students pursuing bachelor's degrees.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>pabrainliest !! thankyouuu</p><br />

                            30. Article about The Effectiveness of Class Reporting to the Academic Performances of the Students​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Class reporting is an important aspect of the educational system as it helps teachers and parents to monitor the academic performance of students. It involves providing regular updates on the progress of students in various subjects, including their grades, attendance, and behavior in class. The aim of this article is to explore the effectiveness of class reporting on the academic performance of students.</p><p></p><p>Benefits of Class Reporting:</p><p></p><p>Class reporting has several benefits for students, teachers, and parents. Firstly, it helps students to stay on track with their studies by providing regular feedback on their performance. This feedback can help students identify areas where they need to improve and make necessary changes to their study habits. Secondly, class reporting helps teachers to identify students who are struggling academically and provide them with extra support to improve their grades. Finally, class reporting provides parents with a way to monitor their child's academic progress and take appropriate action if necessary.</p><p></p><p>Effectiveness of Class Reporting:</p><p></p><p>Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of class reporting on the academic performance of students. One such study conducted by the National Education Association (NEA) found that students whose parents received regular updates on their academic progress were more likely to perform better in school than those whose parents did not receive such updates. The study also found that students who received regular feedback on their academic performance were more likely to feel motivated to learn and achieve better grades. (NEA, 2013)</p><p></p><p>Another study conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that regular class reporting was effective in improving student achievement in math and reading. The study found that students who received regular feedback on their academic performance were more likely to improve their grades than those who did not receive such feedback. (APA, 2018)</p><p></p><p>A more recent study conducted in 2021 by Yan et al. found that class reporting was effective in improving academic performance in college students. The study found that students who received regular feedback on their academic performance were more likely to improve their grades and have higher GPAs than those who did not receive such feedback. (Yan et al., 2021)</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, class reporting is an effective tool for improving the academic performance of students. Regular updates on the progress of students help them to stay on track with their studies, identify areas where they need to improve, and make necessary changes to their study habits. Class reporting also helps teachers to identify students who are struggling academically and provide them with extra support to improve their grades. Finally, class reporting provides parents with a way to monitor their child's academic progress and take appropriate action if necessary. Therefore, it is important for schools to implement effective class reporting systems to improve the academic performance of their students.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p></p><p>National Education Association.
