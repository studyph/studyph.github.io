                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Experiment
</p><p>Molar Mass by Freezing Point Depression
</p><p>OBJECTIVES:
</p><p>In this experiment, you will determine the freezing point of cyclohexane and the freezing point of a solution
</p><p>containing a weighed amount of unknown solute and cyclohexane. You will determine the molar mass of the
</p><p>unknown solute based on the decrease in the freezing point.
</p><p>INTRODUCTION:
</p><p>Several important properties of solutions depend on the number of solute particles in the solution and not on
</p><p>the nature of the solute particles. These properties are called COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES, because they
</p><p>all depend on the number of solute particles present, whether these particles are atoms, molecules, or ions.
</p><p>The colligative properties are: vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression,
</p><p>and osmotic pressure.
</p><p>FREEZING POINT DEPRESSION:
</p><p>The addition of a solute to a solvent will decrease the freezing point (temperature) of the solvent. The
</p><p>decrease in freezing point, ∆ Tf, when a nonvolatile, nonionizing (nondissociating) solute is dissolved in a
</p><p>solvent is proportional to the molal concentration, m, of the solute present in the solution.
</p><p> ∆ Tf α m
</p><p> ∆ Tf = Kf m
</p><p>Kf is a constant for a given solvent. Kf is called the molal freezing point depression constant and
</p><p>represents how many degrees the freezing point of the solvent will change when 1.00 mole of a nonvolatile
</p><p>nonionizing (nondissociating) solute dissolves in one kilogram of solvent. The table below gives values of Kf
</p><p>for various solvents. The molal freezing point depression constant for H2O, Kf , is given as
</p><p>1.86 °C.kg/mole. Thus a1.00 m aqueous solution freezes at -1.86 °C instead of 0.00°C which is the normal
</p><p>freezing point for water.
</p><p>Table: Molal freezing point depression constants of several solvents
</p><p>Solvent Freezing point, °C Kf , °C.kg/mole
</p><p>acetone -95.4 2.4 0
</p><p>benzene 5.5 5.12
</p><p>cyclohexane 6.5 20.1
</p><p>water 0.0 1.86
</p><p>Notice that the freezing point of a substance or a mixture is the temperature at which the solid and liquid
</p><p>phases are in equilibrium at one atm of pressure. The next exercise illustrates how to use the experimentally
</p><p>measured decrease of freezing point, ∆Tf, to calculate the molar mass of an unknown nonvolatile
</p><p>nondissociating solution</p><p><strong>Explanation </strong></p><p><strong>Hope it Helps</strong></p><br />
