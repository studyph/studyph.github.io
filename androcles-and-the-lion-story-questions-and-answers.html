                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The story began with a slave named Androcles who had fled from his master and was hiding in the forest.While hiding, Androcles encountered a lion who had a thorn in its paw. Androcles helped to remove the thorn from the lion's paw, and the lion did not harm him.Androcles and the lion met again in an arena where Androcles was thrown in to be killed by other wild animals. However, when the lion recognized Androcles, it showed him affection and did not harm him.The story ended with the Emperor being impressed by what had happened and pardoning Androcles.The lion did not attack Androcles because he had shown kindness to it earlier by removing the thorn from its paw. As a result, the lion recognized Androcles and did not see him as a threat or prey.<br />

                        A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live.<br />But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days.<br /><br />The emperor and all his court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognized his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog.<br /><br />The emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the lion let loose to his native forest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                            12. how to make the narrative about the story about Androcles and the lion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Androcles who lived in ancient Rome. He was a slave who had been sold to a cruel and heartless master. Androcles was treated poorly and was often punished for the smallest mistakes.</p><p></p><p>One day, Androcles decided to escape from his master's house and fled into the forest. As he was wandering through the dense woods, he suddenly heard a loud roar. He looked around and saw a huge lion approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Androcles was terrified and thought that the lion would surely attack and kill him. But to his surprise, the lion stopped in front of him and began to lick his feet. Androcles realized that the lion was not trying to harm him, but was actually in pain.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the lion had a large thorn stuck in its paw and was unable to remove it. Androcles, who had once been a doctor, carefully removed the thorn from the lion's paw. The lion roared in pain at first, but then licked Androcles' hand as a sign of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Androcles and the lion became friends. They would often spend time together in the forest, and the lion would even bring Androcles food to eat. However, their happiness was short-lived as Androcles was eventually caught and taken back to his master's house.</p><p></p><p>As punishment for his escape, Androcles was sentenced to be thrown into the Colosseum to be devoured by wild animals. On the day of his execution, Androcles was thrown into the arena, and to his amazement, the lion he had befriended appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The lion recognized Androcles and ran towards him, licking his face and wagging his tail. The audience was stunned and moved by the sight of the lion's affection towards Androcles. The Emperor, who was watching the spectacle, was so impressed by the bond between the man and the lion that he ordered Androcles to be set free.</p><p></p><p>Androcles and the lion walked out of the Colosseum together, and the people cheered for them. From that day on, Androcles was a free man, and he and the lion continued to live together in the forest. Their friendship had conquered all obstacles, and they remained loyal to each other until the end of their days.</p><br />

The story starts out in a Roman city that Androcles escapes from and moves to the wilderness outside the city, where Androcles is hiding.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Lion and the Three Cows
</p><p>A fable from Afghanistan told by A. Naweed Aryan
</p><p>In a green and soft meadow, a brown, a black and a white cow lived happily together. 
</p><p>They liked their habitat and each other and most of the times browsed together. 
</p><p>One day a lion came to the meadow and saw the cows. He thought, “This is a good place. 
</p><p>I can stay here and hunt the cows. They can provide my food for a long time.”
</p><p>The next day he went to hunt one of the cows but the other two defended their friend and 
</p><p>during the battle the Lion was injured and escaped for his life. 
</p><p>“Oh, that was not easy. I was almost killed by those cows. I can not get even a bit of food 
</p><p>while these cows are together. I should do something about it,” thought the Lion. 
</p><p>The next day the Lion went to the cows and shouted, “Please listen to me. Yesterday I 
</p><p>wanted to talk to your friend and he thought that I was going to attack him. So you all attacked 
</p><p>me and nearly killed me. I came here for peace.”
</p><p>“You wanted to attack me when I was sleeping. You are lying and we don’t believe you,” 
</p><p>said the White cow. 
</p><p>“No I wasn’t going to attack you. I wanted to tell you what I have to tell now.”
</p><p>“So what do you want to say?” said the Brown cow.
</p><p>“When I saw this place for the first time, I liked it. I just wanted to ask you if you would 
</p><p>let me stay here and in return I will protect you against your enemies.”
</p><p>The cows talked to each other and said, “Ok, you can stay here but don’t come close too 
</p><p>us. We will let you stay here and you will have to protect us.”
</p><p>“Ok, don’t be afraid of me. I can hunt small animals and I will never harm you,” said the 
</p><p>Lion.
</p><p>So the Lion stayed there for some days. One day he saw that the White cow was 
</p><p>browsing farther away the Black and Brown cows. He came to the two cows and said, “You 
</p><p>know, I think this place is very nice but it will not remain like this if that fat cow keeps eating the 
</p><p>nice grasses. He eats a lot more than you. Also his color is different than you. We are dark and 
</p><p>he is white. Let me kill him so there will be enough grass for you.”
</p><p>After some talks the two cows agreed that the Lion could kill their friend and so the Lion 
</p><p>attacked and killed him. He ate his meat and had some food for quite a time. 
</p><p>Then another day he saw that the two cows were browsing separately. He came to the 
</p><p>Brown cow and said, “I want to be your personal friend but first you have to prove it.” 
</p><p>“How can I prove it?” said the Brown cow. 
</p><p>“Well, I thought for quite a while and I found out that I and you are very similar. My 
</p><p>color and yours is the same. Let me kill the Black cow so this wonderful place will be for the two 
</p><p>friends of one color.”
</p><p>The Brown cow agreed and the Lion attacked and killed the Black cow. He was happy 
</p><p>for sometime until he became hungry again. He came to the Brown cow and said, “You are my 
</p><p>best friend and of course I am your best friend. Now your best friend is hungry and there is no 
</p><p>meat for him except your meat. Get ready to be killed for I am too hungry and can not wait.”
</p><p>The Brown cow knew that he had no defense against the Lion, so he accepted his </p><p></p><br />
