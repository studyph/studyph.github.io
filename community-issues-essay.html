                            1. Example of community issues and concerns essay​</h2><br />
                        <p>Many people believe that our government should do more to solve our problems. Yet, when we expect our government, rather than ourselves, to come up with solutions for both our communities' and nations' ills, we have walked down a path which leads us away from being self-reliant and independent. Why can we not affect changes in our communities to everyone's benefit when it is within our abilities? Why must we always ask the government for help to solve community problems when there are more serious national problems to be dealt with? These community problems would ultimately distract the government from focusing on national problems. Indeed, each community must be more responsible for their problems, for example, crime, local pollution, inadequate transportation, and education.
</p><p>
</p><p>Crimes including burglaries, robberies, mugging, and car theft can disrupt and destroy communities. Such crimes can be prevented by effectively by recruiting more police officers to patrol streets, improving security with CCTV and locks within buildings, and increasing the citizens' awareness on how to protect themselves. Advertisements and lectures by the police or local community centers may help to raise awareness so that the local residents would know how to prevent thefts. Since there is a possibility that thefts may often be carried out by teenagers who have nothing to do during the day, youth centers may be set up by the local community using donations so that teenagers may have free recreational activities to keep them occupied.
</p><p>
</p><p>Apart from relying on the construction of youth centers, parents must realize that they are also responsible for their children's actions. By spending more time with their children and caring more about their personal life, parents may play an active role in decreasing the rate of teenage crimes since the teenagers would have adults to turn to when they meet financial and psychological difficulties. Apart from preventing crimes, parents' care may also help improve the education of the next generation. Likewise, inappropriate teaching methods such as wrong punishments may lead to crimes. Examples of children resenting their parents' inappropriate methods of teaching such as brutality and unreasonable punishments and turning to committing crimes in the end can often be seen in literatures and movies.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#learnwithbrainly</p><p>pa-brainly nalang po</p><br />

                            2. narrative essay about communication issues​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>narrative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Communication is a vital process in organizations and companies in today’s world. It has been defined as an activity that entails transmitting information through interexchange of views or messages by behavior, signals, writing, visuals, and speech. The process of communication requires a sender, the message to be sent, and a receiver. However, it is mandatory for the receiver to be aware of the sender’s intention to communicate. This means that a sender can be able to communicate with a receiver across vast distances (Wilson 2010).
</p><p>
</p><p>Normally, the communication the process is complete after it is clear that the receiver understood the message as intended by the sender. Communicative commonality is integral to effective communication between communicating parties. Effective communication is not only needed inside an organization but also when dealing with external stakeholders. It enables organization to achieve competitive edge considering the fact that it through it that an organization remains responsive to consumer needs (Jones &amp; George 2007). On the contrary, poor communication disrupts almost everything in an organization.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of barriers to effective communication (Huczynski &amp; Buchanan 2010). This paper intends to highlight the barriers and how three organizations (Professional Sports, Bernard Mathews, and NHS trust Hospital) have been able to handle the barriers to ensure effective communication. Barriers to Effective Communication Barriers to communication are factors that might hinder effective communication between parties in the workplace. According to Antony and MacVicar (2011), this includes language barriers, cultural barriers, organizational barriers, personal barriers, and interpersonal barriers.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Communication Issues
</p><p>Each of us communicate on a daily basis, but oftentimes we miscommunicate and do not get our intended point across. There are a lot of guidelines that help to make for more effective communications, one being is to have eye contact with the person you are communicating with. By looking at the person it shows that a you are interested in what the person is saying and are paying attention and is engaged with the conversation. By a lack of eye contact with another other person, it shows that you are disinterested in the conversation. By practicing direct eye contact with the person you are speaking to, will assist in maintaining good lines of communication. Besides, eye contact, it is important to be a good listener. By asking “What” and “Why” questions it will ensure that you are attentive to the what the person is saying. In effective communications between two people, it is important that each individual understand what message is being communicated. It also important to reflect upon what a person has said when there is a pause in the communication. This allows for each individual to think about the conversation and maintain a continuous flow of the conversation. It should be noted that good communications between individuals is a two-way street.
</p><p>As for me personally, there are a lot of situations that has made me a good listener. Oftentimes, I was interrupting the people who were speaking and not listening to what they were talking about. There was a problem for me to be attentive to the details of conversation and I had not listened to them during the conversation and forgetting most everything that was said. One day during a conversation, a friend told me that my problem was that I was not a good listener. They went on to say that I needed to develop more effective listening skills. They suggested that during a conversation, I should focus on a what is being said, remain silent until the speaker has completed what they were saying. In turn, it would show to the speaker that I was interested in what they were saying. It should also be noted that during a conversation, the subject should not be changed as it will disrupt the communication process. When engaged in conversation, I should put aside my own thoughts and intently listen to what the person is saying. I should place all of my attention to the speaker and not hurry the speaker before they have completed what they are saying.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps...</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my community, one of the most pressing issues that I have observed is the lack of proper waste management. Despite the presence of garbage bins and waste collection services, many people still dispose of their waste improperly, leading to unsanitary conditions and environmental degradation.</p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons for this problem is the lack of awareness and education on proper waste disposal methods. Many people do not understand the negative impact of their actions on the environment and their health. As a result, they do not take the necessary steps to ensure that their waste is disposed of properly.</p><p></p><p>Another factor contributing to the problem is the inadequate waste management infrastructure. In some areas, there are not enough garbage bins or waste collection services, leading to overflowing bins and littered streets. This not only creates an eyesore but also poses health risks to the community.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the lack of enforcement of waste management regulations is also a significant issue. Even if there are laws and regulations in place, they are not always enforced, leading to people disregarding them. This lack of enforcement also creates a sense of impunity, where people feel that they can dispose of their waste however they want without consequences.</p><p></p><p>To address this issue, there needs to be a concerted effort from the community, government, and private sector. Firstly, there needs to be more education and awareness campaigns on proper waste disposal methods. This can be done through schools, community centers, and social media platforms. By educating people on the negative impact of improper waste disposal, they will be more likely to take the necessary steps to dispose of their waste properly.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, there needs to be an improvement in waste management infrastructure. This can be done by increasing the number of garbage bins and waste collection services in the community. It is also essential to ensure that these services are efficient and reliable to encourage people to use them.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, there needs to be stricter enforcement of waste management regulations. This can be done by imposing fines and penalties on those who violate the regulations. By doing so, people will be more likely to comply with the regulations, knowing that there are consequences for their actions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the lack of proper waste management is a significant issue in my community that needs to be addressed urgently. By increasing awareness and education, improving waste management infrastructure, and enforcing regulations, we can create a cleaner and healthier environment for everyone. It is essential to work together as a community to address this issue and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It was the third week of April 2020, five weeks since Metro Manila and other provinces were put under “enhanced community quarantine” (ECQ). Under ECQ, school and university classes were suspended, mass gatherings were prohibited, government offices were run with a skeletal workforce, businesses were closed except for those providing essential goods and services, mass transportation was restricted, and people were ordered to observe social distancing measures and to stay at home. At that time, the Philippines had 6,456 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed cases, 426 deaths, and 612 recoveries. Quarantine rules specified that only one person was authorised to go out and buy essential goods for the rest of their family. As the designated “authorised person outside of residence” (APOR), I was given a “quarantine pass,” a document issued by the barangay. With my quarantine pass securely kept in my bag, I went out to buy food and medicine in a nearby market. Without any public transportation, I walked for nearly thirty minutes to get to the market. The street leading to the market was relatively empty. Apart from people who were, like me, walking towards the market, very few vehicles plied the road. Occasionally, an ambulance would pass by as well as illegal motorcycle taxis. As I neared the market, I saw slow-moving vehicles occupying the street. It was as if I had gone back to the “old normal.” Soon I saw police vehicles. I also saw several buses where people were being loaded. I thought the buses were there to transport frontline workers. I was later told that the buses were there to transport people apprehended for violating quarantine guidelines. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Once a country has reached the point of development where most deaths come not from infectious diseases (tuberculosis, dysentery, cholera, malaria, flu, pneumonia, etc.), but from chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes, cancer), the economic and social equality within the society is a greater determinant of death rates and average lifespan than the country’s position with regard to others.</p><p></p><p>Social connectedness. Many studies indicate that “belonging” – whether to a large extended family, a network of friends, a social or volunteer organization, or a faith community – is related to longer life and better health, as well as to community participation.</p><p></p><p>Sense of personal or collective efficacy. This refers to people’s sense of control over their lives.

                        <p><strong>Answer:Health was earlier said to be the ability of the body functioning well. However, as time evolved, the definition of health also evolved. It cannot be stressed enough that health is the primary thing after which everything else follows. When you maintain good health, everything else falls into place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>essay on health</strong></p><p><strong>Similarly, maintaining good health is dependent on a lot of factors. It ranges from the air you breathe to the type of people you choose to spend your time with. Health has a lot of components that carry equal importance. If even one of them is missing, a person cannot be completely healthy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Constituents of Good Health</strong></p><p><strong>First, we have our physical health. This means being fit physically and in the absence of any kind of disease or illness. When you have good physical health, you will have a longer life span. One may maintain their physical health by having a balanced diet. Do not miss out on the essential nutrients; take each of them in appropriate quantities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Secondly, you must exercise daily. It may be for ten minutes only but never miss it. It will help your body maintain physical fitness. Moreover, do not consume junk food all the time. Do not smoke or drink as it has serious harmful consequences. Lastly, try to take adequate sleep regularly instead of using your phone.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Next, we talk about our mental health. Mental health refers to the psychological and emotional well-being of a person. The mental health of a person impacts their feelings and way of handling situations. We must maintain our mental health by being positive and meditating.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Subsequently, social health and cognitive health are equally important for the overall well-being of a person. A person can maintain their social health when they effectively communicate well with others. Moreover, when a person us friendly and attends social gatherings, he will definitely have good social health. Similarly, our cognitive health refers to performing mental processes effectively. To do that well, one must always eat healthily and play brain games like Chess, puzzles and more to sharpen the brain.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Get the huge list of more than 500 Essay Topics and Ideas</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Physical Health Alone is Not Everything</strong></p><p><strong>There is this stigma that surrounds mental health. People do not take mental illnesses seriously. To be completely fit, one must also be mentally fit. When people completely discredit mental illnesses, it creates a negative impact.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For instance, you never tell a person with cancer to get over it and that it’s all in their head in comparison to someone dealing with depression. Similarly, we should treat mental health the same as physical health.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Parents always take care of their children’s physical needs. They feed them with nutritious foods and always dress up their wounds immediately. However, they fail to notice the deteriorating mental health of their child. Mostly so, because they do not give it that much importance. It is due to a lack of awareness amongst people.</strong></p><p><strong>Even amongst adults, you never know what a person is going through mentally.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Thus, we need to be able to recognize the signs of mental illnesses.

                            29. Essay Test *Discuss the ethical issues in communication​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In any organization, the workplace needs to be run in such a way that every person feels part of the organization. On many occasions, decisions are made by the leaders and supervisors, leaving the subordinates as mere observers. Self-initiative is crucial in solving some of the problems that arise and as such, every employee is expected to possess self initiative.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Communication ethics is an integral part of the decision making process in an organization. Employees need to be trained on the importance of ethics in decision making so as to get rid of the blame game factor when wrong choices are made. The working place has changed and the employees have become more independent in the decision making process.</p><p>The issue that arises is whether employees make the right decision that would benefit the company or they make the wrong choices that call for the downfall of the company. Some organizations have called for the establishment of an ethics program that can aid and empower employees so that unethical actions would be intolerable. This is because occasionally, bad decisions destroy organizations making the whole decision making process unethical.</p><p>Some programs on good ethics can help in guiding the employees in the process of decision making. This would ensure the smooth running of organizations and instances of unethical decision making would be null. An ethical decision making process is important in ensuring that the decisions made by the employees are beneficial to organization welfare and operations.</p><p>Ethical communication is prudent in both the society and the organizations. The society can remain functional if every person acted in a way that defines and satisfies who they are. However, this could be short lived because of the high probability of making unethical decisions and consequently, a chaotic society. For this reason, it would be of essence to make ethical rules based on a set guidelines and principles.</p><p>Ethical communications is defined by ethical behavioral principles that include honesty, concern on counterparts, fairness, and integrity. This cannot be achieved if everyone acted in isolation. The action would not be of any good to most people. Adler and Elmhorst (12) note that actions should be based on the professional ethics where other professionals have to agree that the actions in question are ethical and standard. If a behavior is standard there is nothing to fear if exposed to the media</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>IN </strong><strong>MY </strong><strong>OWN </strong><strong>OPINION)</strong></p><p><strong>ANSWER!</strong><strong>!</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p>    For me, It’s hard to be ethical if you don’t know your core values, so begin by making a list of those values. Do you strongly favour honesty? Do you support the “golden rule” of acting towards others the way you’d like them to act towards you? Are generosity and kindness high-priorities in your life?</p><p></p><p>    Once you’re clear with yourself about your values, you can communicate ethically because you won’t mistakenly betray those values. After all, being “ethical” simply means maintaining your values in everything you think, say, and do.</p><p></p><p>    Your values will evolve as you learn and grow, so your ethical conduct will evolve too. If you regret some of your past behaviour, remember that it’s okay to revisit and, if necessary, adjust your values and modify your ethical implementation of them.</p><br />
