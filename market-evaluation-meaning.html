                                            Ethical Dilemma For many months, your prospective ERP customer has been analysing the hundreds of assumptions built into the $900,000 ERP software you are selling. So far, you have knocked yourself out to try to make this sale. If the sale goes through, you will reach your yearly quota and get a nice bonus. On the other hand, loss of this sale may mean you start looking for other employment. The accounting, human resource, supply chain and marketing team’s puts together by the client have reviewed the specifications and finally recommended purchase of the software. However, as you looked over their shoulders and helped them through the evaluation process, you began to realize that their purchasing being done at hundreds of regional stores-were not a good fit for the software. At the very least, the customizing will add $250,000 to the implementation and training cost. The team is not aware of the issue, and you know that the necessary $250,000 is not in the budget. What you do? Please include answers on as many as relevant to the case. (maximum of 300 words​</a>

                            23. Ethical Dilemma For many months, your prospective ERP customer has been analysing the hundreds of assumptions built into the $900,000 ERP software you are selling. So far, you have knocked yourself out to try to make this sale. If the sale goes through, you will reach your yearly quota and get a nice bonus. On the other hand, loss of this sale may mean you start looking for other employment. The accounting, human resource, supply chain and marketing team’s puts together by the client have reviewed the specifications and finally recommended purchase of the software. However, as you looked over their shoulders and helped them through the evaluation process, you began to realize that their purchasing being done at hundreds of regional stores-were not a good fit for the software. At the very least, the customizing will add $250,000 to the implementation and training cost. The team is not aware of the issue, and you know that the necessary $250,000 is not in the budget. What you do? Please include answers on as many as relevant to the case. (maximum of 300 words​</h2><br />
