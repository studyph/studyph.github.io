                                            TASK 1 Directions: Read the sample methodology then answer the questions that follow. Any This research followed the quantitative research design, specifically probing the correlation between the classroom climate and anxiety of students in Mathematics as reflected from their performance. The researcher administered a survey questionnaire to the study participants; which measures students' perception of classroom climate as well as the instrument that measures their anxiety towards mathematics. The researcher adapted the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (RMARS) by Alexander and Martray (1989) to measure anxiety; and the What Is Happening in this Class? (WIHIC) instrument to know the classroom climate. The participants were the 75 selected respondents from Grade 10, coming from 5 heterogeneous classes. Utilizing random sampling, 15 students were chosen from every section which is composed of 55-60 students. All data gathered were given statistical treatment which is the Chi-Square to evaluate Tests of Independence when using a crosstabulation. The results were tabulated, analyzed, and interpreted.

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for women pilots-14,000 feet-in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and the press dubbed her "Lady Lindy." George P Putnam, who published many stories about Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next best seller. Earhart married Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and other promotions on many industries including womer's fashion, magazines and airline management. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set a world record for altitude, reaching 18.415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart and Putnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across the Atlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight On June 1, 1937, Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departed from Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east. After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea When Earhart and Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific with overcast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, they were unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on the island. Though the itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the search continued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart was declared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around the world is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.</p><br />

Any This research followed the quantitative research design, specifically probing the correlation between the classroom climate and anxiety of students in Mathematics as reflected from their performance. The researcher administered a survey questionnaire to the study participants; which measures students' perception of classroom climate as well as the instrument that measures their anxiety towards mathematics. The researcher adapted the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (RMARS) by Alexander and Martray (1989) to measure anxiety; and the What Is Happening in this Class? (WIHIC) instrument to know the classroom climate. The participants were the 75 selected respondents from Grade 10, coming from 5 heterogeneous classes. Utilizing random sampling, 15 students were chosen from every section which is composed of 55-60 students. All data gathered were given statistical treatment which is the Chi-Square to evaluate Tests of Independence when using a crosstabulation. The results were tabulated, analyzed, and interpreted.

This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By looking at the Y-axis or Y-intercept using the Cartesian Plane, You can determine who's taller between two students but since the other student is facing backward you can't be sure that the student that faces toward is taller so if you use a cartesian plane and point the origin in the center of the pic, and look at the Y-axis/Y-intercept you can see clearly that the student that faces forward is taller   than other student</p><br />
