                                            Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>It was a massive social, political, economic and cultural shift.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Metal Age Philippines - 500 BC-AD 1000</p><p>The ancient Filipinos settled beside bodies of water. Hunting and food gathering became supplementary activities as reliance on them was reduced by fishing and the cultivation of the soil. From the hinterland, coastal, and riverine communities, the people evolved an essentially homogeneous culture, a basically common way of life where nature was a primary factor. Community life throughout the archipelago was influenced by, and responded to, common ecology. The generally benign tropical climate and the largely uniform flora and fauna favored similarities, not differences. Life was essentially subsistence but not harsh.</p><p>The culture was essentially a river and water-based culture. Fishing and agriculture were predominant means of livelihood. Most of the ancient cultural centers of the Tagalog regions were founded on river banks, specifically near the delta and the "wawa" or the mouth of the river, where the river meets the sea. Riverine communities, especially those by the delta and river-mouth became centers of trade and commerce. In pre-Hispanic Philippines, some of these trade centers were Maynila, Tondo, Sapa, Pasig through the Pasig River; Talim, Bay, Pila, Lumbang through the Laguna de Bai; Balayan though Pansipit River; Lipa and Taal through Bonbon or Taal Lake.</p><p>The early Filipinos had a culture that was basically Malayan in structure and form. They had languages that traced their origin to the Austronesian parent-stock and used them not only as media of daily communication but also as vehicles for the expression of their literary moods. They fashioned concepts and beliefs about the world that they could not see, but which they sensed to be part of their lives. They had their own religion and religious beliefs. They believed in the immortality of the soul and life after death. Their rituals were based on beliefs in a ranking deity whom they called Bathalang Maykapal, and a host of other deities, in the environmental spirits and in soul spirits. The early Filipinos adored the sun, the moon, the animals and birds, for they seemed to consider the objects of Nature as something to be respected. They venerated almost any object that was close to their daily life, indicating the importance of the relationship between man and the object of nature.</p><p>Taro, yams, and millet were the staple cereals of the islanders. These were planted in swidden fields, and around the margins of swidden patches devoted to dry upland rice. In the preconquest period, rice was highly valued and perhaps considered the most esteemed cereal, but it was not a daily staple. Rice production was insufficient and did not allow year-round consumption: even datus with many slaves ate root crops in certain seasons. Since only in a few places could a year’s supply of rice be produced, root crops were the most common food for part of the year, or all of the year for part of the people. Subject to seasonal flooding, the alluvial plains produced large quantities of irrigated rice and supported a large population, but even there, despite the abundance of rice in some places and for some people, the staple food was root crops.</p><p>freestar</p><p>Laws were either customary or written. Customary laws were handed down orally from generation to generation and constituted the bulk of the laws of the barangay. They were preserved in songs and chants and in the memory of the elder persons in the community. The written laws were those that the chieftain and his elders promulgated from time to time as the necessity arose. The oldest known written body of laws was the Maragtas Code by Datu Sumakwel at about 1250 AD. Other old codes are the Muslim Code of Luwaran and the Principal Code of Sulu. Whether customary or written, the laws dealt with various subjects, such as inheritance, divorce, usury, loans, partnership, crime and punishment, property rights, family relations and adoption. Whenever disputes arose, these were decided peacefully through a court composed by the chieftain as "judge" and the barangay elders as "jury." Conflicts arising between subjects of different barangays were resolved by arbitration in which a board composed of elders from neutral barangays acted as arbiters.</p><p></p><br />

It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4. Is the creation of jeepney beneficial to Filipinos?5. Are you amenable to the proposed phase out of jeepney?​</h2><br />
                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />
