                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A force can change the direction in which an object is moving. A bigger force on an object will produce a bigger change in the motion. A heavier object requires a larger force than a lighter object in order to undergo the same change in motion.</p><p>2. When a force acts on an object, the object may change shape by bending, stretching or compressing</p><p>3. A force acting on an object causes the object to change its shape or size, to start moving, to stop moving, to accelerate or decelerate. When there's the interaction between two objects they exert a force on each other, these exerted forces are equal in size but opposite in direction.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>force</strong><strong> </strong>is a push or pull that can cause an object to move, stop, or change speed or direction.</p><p>2.<strong>Gravity as well as electrostatic and magnetic attraction and repulsion</strong><strong> </strong>provide real life examples of forces being exerted by one object on another without them being in contact with each other.</p><p>3. <strong>Force</strong><strong> </strong>can change the shape of an object. ... Works to slow down or stop motion due to surfaces rubbing against each other.</p><p>4. <strong>Friction</strong><strong> </strong> is directed opposite the direction of relative motion or the intended direction of motion of either of the surfaces. The force exerted by an object being pulled upon from opposite ends like a string, rope, cable, chain, etc. Tension is directed along the axis of the object.</p><p>5. <strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>none</strong><strong> </strong><strong>contact</strong><strong> </strong><strong>force</strong><strong> </strong>Many young students will have had memorable but often confusing experiences with magnets and magnetic materials. Magnetic materials are regularly encountered around the home, often holding small objects on the kitchen fridge or keeping cupboards and fridge doors closed. Many children’s toys employ weak magnets to ‘stick’ materials together (e.g. wooden train carriages) or are used in simple children’s construction toys to allow them to quickly assemble more complex structures without the need for messy adhesives or difficult connections. Toys very rarely make use of magnetic repulsion.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>5. All objects (living and non-living) can apply a force on or to another object; also all objects (living and non living) can be affected by forces. For example for non- contact forces are a magnet and a paperclip and the moon's gravity and the earth's tides. The two non- contact forces are magnetism and gravity.</p><p></p><p>6. A force acting on an object causes the object to change its shape or size, to start moving, to stop moving, to accelerate or decelerate. ... In such a case the object will move at a steady speed in a straight line. If the resultant force acting on the object isn't zero then: the object will either accelerate or decelerate.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. You Need a Force</p><p>2. When a force acts on an object, the object may change shape by bending, stretching or compressing - or a combination of all three shape changes. ... Pull an object's ends apart, eg when a rubber band is stretched. Push an object's ends together, eg when an empty drinks can is squashed.</p><p>3. Yes -  Depending on what type of object it is and how strong the force applicated is, if the object is solid it can break therefore changing thr object's shape and size</p><p>4. An object with no net forces acting on it which is initially at rest will remain at rest. If it is moving, it will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity.</p><p>5. In the absence of any forces, no force is required to keep an object moving.</p><p>6. If the forces are not balanced then the motion of the object changes. It may speed up, slow down and/or change direction. A large unbalanced force on an object will produce a bigger change in motion than a smaller unbalanced force on the same object.</p><p>7. A <strong>force</strong> can speed up or slow down an object. A force can change the direction in which an object is moving. A bigger force on an object will produce a bigger change in the motion. A heavier object requires a larger force than a lighter object in order to undergo the same change in motion.</p><p>8. <strong>Forces </strong>affect how objects move. They may cause motion; they may also slow, stop, or change the direction of motion of an object that is already moving. Since force cause changes in the speed or direction of an object, we can say that forces cause changes in velocity.  So forces cause acceleration</p><p>9 When force is applied on a stationary object, <strong>the object tends to move in the direction in which force is applied.</strong> For example, applying force on a stationary tennis ball will make it continue its motion in the direction of applied force.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>I hope it helps you.
