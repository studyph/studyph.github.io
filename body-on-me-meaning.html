Tell me who he is.” Surati was defenseless, she cried. “It is my brother‘s head dress. I met him several days ago when you went hunting. He gave me his head dress and told me to put it under my pillow. So I put it there to show my respect for him. It is Rupaksa who wants to kll you, not me.” But Raden no longer trust her. He decided to penalize Surati by giving her a death sentence near the riverbank. “Before I die, let me say a few words,” Surati pleaded. “Please do,” Raden granted Surati‘s request. Surati spoke calmly, “When I die, just throw my body into the river. If water becomes dirty and smelly, it means that I am guilty. But if the water becomes clear and fragrant, it means that I am innocent.” Then as Raden stabbed her wife with a kris, Surati threw herself into the river. Amazingly the water became clear and fragrant. Surati was innocent! Raden regretted what he had done. From then on, he changed the name of his kingdom into Banyuwangi. Banyu means water and Wangi means fragrance.guys  help  change  the ending story ​</a>

                            7. “Your not faithful to me. I know that you want me dead. This is the evidence. This is from a man who will help you kill me. Tell me who he is.” Surati was defenseless, she cried. “It is my brother‘s head dress. I met him several days ago when you went hunting. He gave me his head dress and told me to put it under my pillow. So I put it there to show my respect for him. It is Rupaksa who wants to kll you, not me.” But Raden no longer trust her. He decided to penalize Surati by giving her a death sentence near the riverbank. “Before I die, let me say a few words,” Surati pleaded. “Please do,” Raden granted Surati‘s request. Surati spoke calmly, “When I die, just throw my body into the river. If water becomes dirty and smelly, it means that I am guilty. But if the water becomes clear and fragrant, it means that I am innocent.” Then as Raden stabbed her wife with a kris, Surati threw herself into the river. Amazingly the water became clear and fragrant. Surati was innocent! Raden regretted what he had done. From then on, he changed the name of his kingdom into Banyuwangi. Banyu means water and Wangi means fragrance.guys  help  change  the ending story ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Raden realized that he had been wrong to accuse Surati and punished her without giving her a chance to defend herself. He was filled with regret and remorse for his actions. Raden decided to do everything he could to make amends for his mistake. He searched for Surati's brother, Rupaksa, and brought him to justice for trying to harm Raden. Raden also made sure that Surati's memory was honored and celebrated in his kingdom. He renamed the kingdom Banyuwangi in her honor, and made sure that the people of the kingdom knew the story of Surati's innocence and Raden's regret. Raden also vowed to always be fair and just in his rule, and to never again make a decision without considering all the facts and evidence.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>YES.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The poem is showing irony because it is talking about the piles of bodies from war and how they are being covered by grass and forgotten, but the grass is personified and speaks of how it is covering all of these bodies and the atrocities of war. The grass is saying that it will cover all of the bodies, no matter how many there are, and that it will continue to grow despite the violence and death. The literal meaning of the poem is about the aftermath of war and how nature continues on despite the human suffering.</p><p></p>Pa Brainliest po, Thanks<br />
