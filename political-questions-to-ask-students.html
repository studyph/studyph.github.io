                                            For this assignment, students must watch Episode # 7 from Season 17 of CBC’s “Dragons Den”. Dragons Den is a popular Canadian TV show, where Canadian entrepreneurs present their startup business plans and ask for funding from successful Canadian businesspeople. After watching the episode, students must answer a series of questions (found below) about one of the five segments (stories) in the episode that relate to topics presented in Chapter 5 of the textbook, “Entrepreneurship”. 
QUESTIONS:
1.	How did the entrepreneur(s) from your segment come up with the idea for his/her/their product? If he or she (or they) does not mention how they came up with the idea then tell me this in your answer (write “This information is not provided”) BUT I do want you to tell me how you think they came up with this idea, using all the information given in the segment.
2.	Using the information provided in the segment, describe, in all the detail provided, the offering (so a description of the product, its price, where it is sold and how it is promoted at the time of the airing of the show) that is being pitched (presented) by the entrepreneur(s) to the Dragons. 
3.	Did the Dragons like the product/business idea/entrepreneur? Tell me what each of the Dragons (you must name each of the Dragons in your answer) had to say about the offering/entrepreneur and proposal. Include all details provided in the segment 
4.	Using the information in the segment, identify the external business environment that, in your opinion, has contributed most to the success of the business to date? Explain your answer, and categorize this opportunity using the categories presented in our text (Chapter 1: economic, competitive, social, demographic, political and legal, global, technological, etc.)
5.	What do the Dragons want to know from the entrepreneur(s) before they will invest in this business? Again, provide the details! Identify at least two questions that the Dragons asked and provide the entrepreneur’(s) answers to those two specific questions.
6.	What else does the entrepreneur(s) want from the Dragons in addition to money? 
7.	What deal does the entrepreneur propose at the beginning of the show? Make sure you identify the type of financing using all the correct terminology from the textbook (Chapter 8), and support your answer with evidence from the segment. 
8.	If you could make one suggestion to the entrepreneur that you think would really help their business, what would it be? 
Cite the segment using MLA citation and any other resources you have used to complete the assignment. </a>

                            13. For this assignment, students must watch Episode # 7 from Season 17 of CBC’s “Dragons Den”. Dragons Den is a popular Canadian TV show, where Canadian entrepreneurs present their startup business plans and ask for funding from successful Canadian businesspeople. After watching the episode, students must answer a series of questions (found below) about one of the five segments (stories) in the episode that relate to topics presented in Chapter 5 of the textbook, “Entrepreneurship”. 
QUESTIONS:
1.	How did the entrepreneur(s) from your segment come up with the idea for his/her/their product? If he or she (or they) does not mention how they came up with the idea then tell me this in your answer (write “This information is not provided”) BUT I do want you to tell me how you think they came up with this idea, using all the information given in the segment.
2.	Using the information provided in the segment, describe, in all the detail provided, the offering (so a description of the product, its price, where it is sold and how it is promoted at the time of the airing of the show) that is being pitched (presented) by the entrepreneur(s) to the Dragons. 
3.	Did the Dragons like the product/business idea/entrepreneur? Tell me what each of the Dragons (you must name each of the Dragons in your answer) had to say about the offering/entrepreneur and proposal. Include all details provided in the segment 
4.	Using the information in the segment, identify the external business environment that, in your opinion, has contributed most to the success of the business to date? Explain your answer, and categorize this opportunity using the categories presented in our text (Chapter 1: economic, competitive, social, demographic, political and legal, global, technological, etc.)
5.	What do the Dragons want to know from the entrepreneur(s) before they will invest in this business? Again, provide the details! Identify at least two questions that the Dragons asked and provide the entrepreneur’(s) answers to those two specific questions.
6.	What else does the entrepreneur(s) want from the Dragons in addition to money? 
7.	What deal does the entrepreneur propose at the beginning of the show? Make sure you identify the type of financing using all the correct terminology from the textbook (Chapter 8), and support your answer with evidence from the segment. 
8.	If you could make one suggestion to the entrepreneur that you think would really help their business, what would it be? 
Cite the segment using MLA citation and any other resources you have used to complete the assignment. </h2><br />
                        Answer<br />Segment: “Barebottom Shoes”<br /><br />1. The entrepreneur, Alyssa Bertram, came up with the idea for Barebottom Shoes after experiencing discomfort and pain from wearing high heels for extended periods of time. She noticed a gap in the market for stylish and comfortable flat shoes that could be worn for both formal and casual events.<br /><br />2. Barebottom Shoes are a line of fashionable and comfortable flat shoes that are sold online and in select retail stores. The shoes are made with high-quality materials and feature a unique cushioning technology for added comfort. At the time of airing, the shoes were priced at $165 per pair and were being promoted through social media and influencer marketing.<br /><br />3. The Dragons were impressed with Bertram's business and product idea. All Dragons, with the exception of one, offered investment deals. Manjit Minhas offered $250,000 for a 25% stake, Arlene Dickinson offered $300,000 for a 20% stake, Jim Treliving offered $250,000 for a 20% stake, and Michele Romanow offered $250,000 for a 22.5% stake. However, Joe Mimran did not make an offer as he believed the business had not yet reached its full potential.<br /><br />4. The external business environment that has contributed most to the success of Barebottom Shoes is the social environment. There is a growing trend towards comfortable and practical footwear among women, especially as more people are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is reflected in the increasing demand for athleisure and casual wear.<br /><br />5. The Dragons wanted to know more about Bertram's marketing and sales strategy, as well as the scalability of the business. Two specific questions asked were: "How do you plan on scaling this business?" and "What are your sales numbers to date?" Bertram's answers included plans to increase production and expand her online presence, and sales numbers of over $200,000 in the previous year.<br /><br />6. In addition to money, Bertram also wanted mentorship and guidance from the Dragons to help grow her business.<br /><br />7. Bertram proposed a $250,000 investment in exchange for a 15% equity stake in her business. This is an example of equity financing, where investors provide funds in exchange for partial ownership of the company.<br /><br />8. One suggestion for Bertram would be to explore the potential of expanding her product line to include other types of comfortable footwear, such as sandals or boots.<br /><br />MLA citation:<br />CBC. “Barebottom Shoes: A Flat for Every Occasion.” Dragons' Den, season 17, episode 7, CBC Television, 14 Nov. 2019.<br /><br />Textbook reference:<br />Kuratko, D.
