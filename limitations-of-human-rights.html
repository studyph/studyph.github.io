Rest is as important as work for the fundamental growth of a person, and is a basic human right.

                            14. human rights are absolute and can be exercise without limitation​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Not all human rights principles enjoy the same level of protection. Instead, they can have different legal characteristics, being absolute or non-absolute in nature or having inherent limitations.</p><p></p><p>Some of the most fundamental human rights are "absolute". Such rights include the prohibitions on torture, on slavery and on retroactive criminal laws. The absolute character of these rights means that it is not permitted to restrict these rights by balancing their enjoyment against the pursuit of a legitimate aim. For example, article 2 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that "[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture". Similarly, in response to the practice of some States, the Human Rights Committee has stated that "[t]he prohibitions against the taking of hostages, abductions or unacknowledged detention are not subject to derogation. The absolute nature of these prohibitions, even in times of emergency, is justified by their status as norms of general international law" (Human Rights Committee General Comment CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, para. 13(b)).</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
