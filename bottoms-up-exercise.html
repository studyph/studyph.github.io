                                            Take 2 dice. Dice are made up so that opposite faces add up to 7. Make sure that 6 is opposite 1, the 5 is opposite 2, and the 4 is opposite 3. Roll the dice and then multiply the top two numbers multiply the bottom two numbers multiply the top of one die by the bottom of the other and now multiply the other top and bottom Now add up all of your (four) answers, and it always adds up to 49. Why? (In the text below, some words are omitted. These have been underlined. Click just above the line. See what happens.) First note that each die, a _________ , has _________ faces which are paired - a face and its opposite - into _________ pairs. Let's call a pair of faces relevant to a roll of a die, if this happens to be the top/bottom pair of faces after the roll. Thus, for a roll, one of the three possible pairs is relevant. When two dice are thrown, there are two relevant pairs: one for each die. An important question is, How many different combinations of two relevant pairs are there? There are _________ possibilities for one die and also _________ possibilities for the other. In all, there are 3×3 = _________ Let's take an example. Assume one die rolled 6 on the top, the other 2, which means that the first die's relevant pair is 6/1, that of the second 2/5, _________ and _________ being the numbers on the _________ faces. Following up on the instructions leads to the following sum: 6×2 + 1× _________ + 6× _________ + 1× _________ which is the sum 12 + 5 + 30 + 2 = 49. Which we should have expected, right? Now, if the first die showed 1 at the top, the relevant pair would be the same and the calculations would be just a little different: 1×2 + 6×5 + 1×5 + 6×2 with the sum 2 + 30 + 5 + 12 = 49. A simple rearrangement of the sum before: the _________ products are the same, their order in the sum is slightly different. What is the point of all this pair counting? Well, be patient, you'll see the light shortly. Denote the pairs (of faces) A, B, C. The possible combinations are: A-A, A-B, A-C, B-A, B-B, B-C, C-A, C-B, C-C. The pairs A-B and B-A lead to the same calculations (please verify this), as are the pairs A-C and _________ and B-C and _________ . The conclusion is that, in order to solve the problem, it is only necessary to carry out the calculations for six pairs: A-A, A-B, A-C, B-B, B-C, C-C. Not a big task actually and a good exercise, too. To sum up: in order to pake sagutan po Yung Blanco thank yousolve the problem, all one has to do is verify that in _________ cases indicated above the result is always 49. This is one solution. A more advanced (one can say algebraic) solution goes like that. Assume T and B are the top and the bottom numbers on one die, and their lower case counterparts _________ are the top and the bottom numbers on the second die. The instructions lead to the following sum: T×t + B×b + T×b + t×B. This sum can be modified using the commutative law (both for addition and multiplication): T×t + T×b + _________ = T×t + T×b + t×B + B×b = T×t + T×b + _________ Now, the distributive law enters the fray twice: T×t + T×b + B×t + B×b = T×(t + b) + B×(t + b) = _________ And finally comes the punch line: recollect that the dice are created so that in any pair of the opposite faces the numbers add up to _________ ! Therefore, T + B = 7 and also t + b = 7. And, as every one knows, 7×7 is _________ !​</a>

Digital IDs for Development: Access to identify and Services for All
Dahan, Mariana; Sudan, Randeep
Lack of Personal official identification (ID) prevents people from fully exercising their rights and isolated them socially and economically – voting, legal action, receipt of government benefits, banking, and borrowing are all virtually closed off. The widespread lack of ID in developing countries is a critical stumbling block to national growth. Digital ID, combined with the already extensive use of mobile devices in the developing world, offers a transformative solution to the problem – a simple means for capturing personal ID that can reach far more people; and new, more efficient ways of government and business to reach and serve the population. Robust digital ID system can produce huge savings for citizens, government, and business, increase transparency and accountability, and drive innovation. Harnessing their power will require strong political will and leadership, foreign assistance matched with local incentives, and a supportive institutional environment. Trust in data security will be critical to achieving tangible results.

                            13. Take 2 dice. Dice are made up so that opposite faces add up to 7. Make sure that 6 is opposite 1, the 5 is opposite 2, and the 4 is opposite 3. Roll the dice and then multiply the top two numbers multiply the bottom two numbers multiply the top of one die by the bottom of the other and now multiply the other top and bottom Now add up all of your (four) answers, and it always adds up to 49. Why? (In the text below, some words are omitted. These have been underlined. Click just above the line. See what happens.) First note that each die, a _________ , has _________ faces which are paired - a face and its opposite - into _________ pairs. Let's call a pair of faces relevant to a roll of a die, if this happens to be the top/bottom pair of faces after the roll. Thus, for a roll, one of the three possible pairs is relevant. When two dice are thrown, there are two relevant pairs: one for each die. An important question is, How many different combinations of two relevant pairs are there? There are _________ possibilities for one die and also _________ possibilities for the other. In all, there are 3×3 = _________ Let's take an example. Assume one die rolled 6 on the top, the other 2, which means that the first die's relevant pair is 6/1, that of the second 2/5, _________ and _________ being the numbers on the _________ faces. Following up on the instructions leads to the following sum: 6×2 + 1× _________ + 6× _________ + 1× _________ which is the sum 12 + 5 + 30 + 2 = 49. Which we should have expected, right? Now, if the first die showed 1 at the top, the relevant pair would be the same and the calculations would be just a little different: 1×2 + 6×5 + 1×5 + 6×2 with the sum 2 + 30 + 5 + 12 = 49. A simple rearrangement of the sum before: the _________ products are the same, their order in the sum is slightly different. What is the point of all this pair counting? Well, be patient, you'll see the light shortly. Denote the pairs (of faces) A, B, C. The possible combinations are: A-A, A-B, A-C, B-A, B-B, B-C, C-A, C-B, C-C. The pairs A-B and B-A lead to the same calculations (please verify this), as are the pairs A-C and _________ and B-C and _________ . The conclusion is that, in order to solve the problem, it is only necessary to carry out the calculations for six pairs: A-A, A-B, A-C, B-B, B-C, C-C. Not a big task actually and a good exercise, too. To sum up: in order to pake sagutan po Yung Blanco thank yousolve the problem, all one has to do is verify that in _________ cases indicated above the result is always 49. This is one solution. A more advanced (one can say algebraic) solution goes like that. Assume T and B are the top and the bottom numbers on one die, and their lower case counterparts _________ are the top and the bottom numbers on the second die. The instructions lead to the following sum: T×t + B×b + T×b + t×B. This sum can be modified using the commutative law (both for addition and multiplication): T×t + T×b + _________ = T×t + T×b + t×B + B×b = T×t + T×b + _________ Now, the distributive law enters the fray twice: T×t + T×b + B×t + B×b = T×(t + b) + B×(t + b) = _________ And finally comes the punch line: recollect that the dice are created so that in any pair of the opposite faces the numbers add up to _________ ! Therefore, T + B = 7 and also t + b = 7. And, as every one knows, 7×7 is _________ !​</h2><br />

Digital IDs for Development: Access to identify and Services for All
Dahan, Mariana; Sudan, Randeep
Lack of Personal official identification (ID) prevents people from fully exercising their rights and isolated them socially and economically – voting, legal action, receipt of government benefits, banking, and borrowing are all virtually closed off. The widespread lack of ID in developing countries is a critical stumbling block to national growth. Digital ID, combined with the already extensive use of mobile devices in the developing world, offers a transformative solution to the problem – a simple means for capturing personal ID that can reach far more people; and new, more efficient ways of government and business to reach and serve the population. Robust digital ID system can produce huge savings for citizens, government, and business, increase transparency and accountability, and drive innovation. Harnessing their power will require strong political will and leadership, foreign assistance matched with local incentives, and a supportive institutional environment. Trust in data security will be critical to achieving tangible results.

You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.

in malls and barangays. Acceptable valid IDs are: Employee ID, with signature of employer or his/her authorized representative, Postal ID, Person with disability (PWD) discount ID, Student’s ID or library card, signed by school authority, Senior Citizen’s ID, Driver’s license, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, Passport, SSS/GSIS ID, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) ID, Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) license and/or For indigenous Filipinos, a Certificate of Confirmation issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
