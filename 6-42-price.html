                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>1. 15</p><p>2. 10%</p><p>3. 480</p><p>4. 2.5%</p><p>5. 5.04</p><p>6. 4</p><p>7. 0.3%</p><p>8. 141</p><p>9. 176</p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>  
<p><strong>1. How to calculate percentage of a number. Use the percentage formula:</strong> P% * X = Y
</p><p><strong>Example: What is 10% of 150?</strong>
</p><p>
</p>Convert the problem to an equation using the percentage formula: P% * X = Y
P is 10%, X is 150, so the equation is 10% * 150 = Y
Convert 10% to a decimal by removing the percent sign and dividing by 100: 10/100 = 0.10
Substitute 0.10 for 10% in the equation: 10% * 150 = Y becomes 0.10 * 150 = Y
Do the math: 0.10 * 150 = 15
Y = 15
So 10% of 150 is 15
Double check your answer with the original question: What is 10% of 150? Multiply 0.10 * 150 = 15
<p><strong>2. How to find what percent of X is Y. Use the percentage formula: Y/X = P%</strong>
</p><p><strong>Example: What percent of 60 is 12?</strong>
</p><p>
</p>Convert the problem to an equation using the percentage formula: Y/X = P%
X is 60, Y is 12, so the equation is 12/60 = P%
Do the math: 12/60 = 0.20
Important! The result will always be in decimal form, not percentage form. You need to multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.
Converting 0.20 to a percent: 0.20 * 100 = 20%
So 20% of 60 is 12.
Double check your answer with the original question: What percent of 60 is 12? 12/60 = 0.20, and multiplying by 100 to get percentage, 0.20 * 100 = 20%
<p><strong>3. How to find X if P percent of it is Y. Use the percentage formula Y/P% = X</strong>
</p><p><strong>Example: 25 is 20% of what number?</strong>
</p><p>
</p>Convert the problem to an equation using the percentage formula: Y/P% = X
Y is 25, P% is 20, so the equation is 25/20% = X
Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.
Converting 20% to a decimal: 20/100 = 0.20
Substitute 0.20 for 20% in the equation: 25/0.20 = X
Do the math: 25/0.20 = X
X = 125
So 25 is 20% of 125
Double check your answer with the original question: 25 is 20% of what number? 25/0.20 = 125
<p><strong>Remember: How to convert a percentage to a decimal</strong>
</p>Remove the percentage sign and divide by 100
15.6% = 15.6/100 = 0.156
<p><strong>Remember: How to convert a decimal to a percentage</strong>
</p>Multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign
0.876 = 0.876 * 100 = 87.6%
