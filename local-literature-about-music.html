                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

The atmosphere was dense for all of my senses. The dimly lit room made it harder for my
eyes to bear the cigarette smoke which drew out stinging tears every time I squint. The crowd did
not help either, making the humid air even heaver on the skin.The melange of smoke, spicy food,
maybe sweat, and alcohol was nauseating. When I opened my mouth I could somehow taste the
air, or was it just the taste of beer and minced pork that lingered in my mouth. The sound of the
90s alternative worked effectively as exhilarant, but was numbing towards the end of the night.
Yet, in spite of this somewhat harsh environment, everything felt right and perfect for me and
seven of high school friends to have our “spur of the moment” reunion of some sort at Sammy’s
— a popular local watering hole for yuppies in Evergreen.
That is how I remember seeing Cathy once again, two years after I attended a party her
parents threw for her after getting her license to practice law. The soft spoken Cathy, that
captivated my heart all through-out high school was there — immaculate with her long black
hair, fair flawless skin, and eyes that glisten and smile at you as if you said something nice or
silly. She was there sitting in front of me wearing her lawyer outfit, turning her head ever so
gently from left to right, listening attentively to stories our friends have so longed held and
waited to share. She smiled and made cute faces, or looked puzzled, then surprised; but what I
considerably noticed about her was that she had become even more stunning and sophisticated.
I remember Cathy back in Evergreen Valley High School; slender and soft-spoken. Her
pretty face was envied by many. Boys would give her flowers and presents every Valentine’s day.
Those who could not find courage to approach her would just leave notes written in post-its
simply folded that half of the sticky part would seal the note and the other half would stick to her
table. Somehow she didn’t mind all that attention.
I, on the other hand, would just carefully observe and wondered what it would be like
having long conversations with her. I thought maybe it would be like just a dreamy exchange of
thoughts about school work and what it would be like in college, and just having to tell her how
sublime it was to spent time with her.
Though reserved with her words and actions, Cathy was very much active in school. She
was in stage plays, the choral, and the volleyball team. She excelled in Biology, Chemistry I
think, and Algebra. An upright student that would sometimes surprise you with unexpected acts
of mischief. I remember her one time helping me in our Algebra exam. I was seated next to her
and was having a hard time computing linear equations. Bitting the tip of my pen and wiping
beads of sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand, she noticed that I was struggling.
She then slightly kicked my foot and cautiously tilted her paper so that I could see her answers. I
keenly copied Cathy’s paper — on guard, alternately looking at Mrs. Harper our teacher
patrolling the aisle and understanding the hieroglyphic juxtaposition of numbers and letters.
I was never good with numbers. I was more into language and literature which my friends
thought was lame. I like arts, music, and writing. I’d rather read novels and magazines in
between practices when I was in the high school basketball varsity. And yes, I was in the
basketball varsity. My saving glory from the shunned and uneventful world of “nerdom.” I was
juggling sports and writing, representing the school in various contests, which eventually
affected my game. Nonetheless, I was an Evergreen Valley Cougar until I graduated.
I was quite popular during high school, but not as popular as Cathy. I did hung out with
the popular kids and even became a student president at one time.</a>

                            2. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

The atmosphere was dense for all of my senses. The dimly lit room made it harder for my
eyes to bear the cigarette smoke which drew out stinging tears every time I squint. The crowd did
not help either, making the humid air even heaver on the skin.The melange of smoke, spicy food,
maybe sweat, and alcohol was nauseating. When I opened my mouth I could somehow taste the
air, or was it just the taste of beer and minced pork that lingered in my mouth. The sound of the
90s alternative worked effectively as exhilarant, but was numbing towards the end of the night.
Yet, in spite of this somewhat harsh environment, everything felt right and perfect for me and
seven of high school friends to have our “spur of the moment” reunion of some sort at Sammy’s
— a popular local watering hole for yuppies in Evergreen.
That is how I remember seeing Cathy once again, two years after I attended a party her
parents threw for her after getting her license to practice law. The soft spoken Cathy, that
captivated my heart all through-out high school was there — immaculate with her long black
hair, fair flawless skin, and eyes that glisten and smile at you as if you said something nice or
silly. She was there sitting in front of me wearing her lawyer outfit, turning her head ever so
gently from left to right, listening attentively to stories our friends have so longed held and
waited to share. She smiled and made cute faces, or looked puzzled, then surprised; but what I
considerably noticed about her was that she had become even more stunning and sophisticated.
I remember Cathy back in Evergreen Valley High School; slender and soft-spoken. Her
pretty face was envied by many. Boys would give her flowers and presents every Valentine’s day.
Those who could not find courage to approach her would just leave notes written in post-its
simply folded that half of the sticky part would seal the note and the other half would stick to her
table. Somehow she didn’t mind all that attention.
I, on the other hand, would just carefully observe and wondered what it would be like
having long conversations with her. I thought maybe it would be like just a dreamy exchange of
thoughts about school work and what it would be like in college, and just having to tell her how
sublime it was to spent time with her.
Though reserved with her words and actions, Cathy was very much active in school. She
was in stage plays, the choral, and the volleyball team. She excelled in Biology, Chemistry I
think, and Algebra. An upright student that would sometimes surprise you with unexpected acts
of mischief. I remember her one time helping me in our Algebra exam. I was seated next to her
and was having a hard time computing linear equations. Bitting the tip of my pen and wiping
beads of sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand, she noticed that I was struggling.
She then slightly kicked my foot and cautiously tilted her paper so that I could see her answers. I
keenly copied Cathy’s paper — on guard, alternately looking at Mrs. Harper our teacher
patrolling the aisle and understanding the hieroglyphic juxtaposition of numbers and letters.
I was never good with numbers. I was more into language and literature which my friends
thought was lame. I like arts, music, and writing. I’d rather read novels and magazines in
between practices when I was in the high school basketball varsity. And yes, I was in the
basketball varsity. My saving glory from the shunned and uneventful world of “nerdom.” I was
juggling sports and writing, representing the school in various contests, which eventually
affected my game. Nonetheless, I was an Evergreen Valley Cougar until I graduated.
I was quite popular during high school, but not as popular as Cathy. I did hung out with
the popular kids and even became a student president at one time.</h2><br />
