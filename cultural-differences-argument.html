Winners of pageants such as Miss America are icons, representations of the ideal woman, and positive role models for young girls. So, society says. More recently, however, a new type of pageant has increased in popularity to the point of being considered a national phenomenon. These pageants are just as glitzy, and the competition is just as fierce; the only difference is that these contestants are the miniature model. They are child beauty queens. The world of child beauty pageants has become a source of fascination, as well as contention, in our society. Networks such as TLC and WE TV have produced hit reality shows featuring the munchkin-sized divas because it sells, but one cannot help but wonder, how can parading children about on stage like show ponies be a positive thing? The truth is it is not. Beauty pageants are not a healthy activity for children because they force young girls to act like little adults, exhibit age-inappropriate sexuality, and have negative body image and mental health problems later in their lives. Children are the future of society, and even those who do not have children should be concerned about the direction of the culture they have to live in. Just because child beauty pageants are socially acceptable does not mean they should be. Our culture needs to eliminate child beauty pageants, at least in their current form. ​</a>

                                            INTRODUCTION Belief vs Conviction A belief is something that is considered correct and true. For example, a person can believe in various things such as cultural or personal faith, morality, or values. It expresses viewpoints, but it is not based on facts or other evidences. A belief is also an opinion, which is why it cannot serve as the basis for a formal argument. Beliefs are very personal ideas and cannot be rejected because they express an opinion. Also, these beliefs are not mandatory to change completely with new experiences. A conviction, is a bit different to a belief. A conviction is something that an individual is convinced of. To be convinced, you need to obtain all the related information. Based on the information that the a conviction is built, a belief changes with time and new experiences, yet, a conviction remains the same. However, conviction is more complex than belief as it becomes a point of view of the world. Basic Signal Phrases in Expressing Beliefs or Convictions I believe... In my opinion... I think...

The truth is it is not. Beauty pageants are not a healthy activity for children because they force young girls to act like little adults, exhibit age-inappropriate sexuality, and have negative body image and mental health problems later in their lives. Children are the future of society, and even those who do not have children should be concerned about the direction of the culture they have to live in. Just because child beauty pageants are socially acceptable does not mean they should be. Our culture needs to eliminate child beauty pageants, at least in their current form. ​</h2><br />

                            23. INTRODUCTION Belief vs Conviction A belief is something that is considered correct and true. For example, a person can believe in various things such as cultural or personal faith, morality, or values. It expresses viewpoints, but it is not based on facts or other evidences. A belief is also an opinion, which is why it cannot serve as the basis for a formal argument. Beliefs are very personal ideas and cannot be rejected because they express an opinion. Also, these beliefs are not mandatory to change completely with new experiences. A conviction, is a bit different to a belief. A conviction is something that an individual is convinced of. To be convinced, you need to obtain all the related information. Based on the information that the a conviction is built, a belief changes with time and new experiences, yet, a conviction remains the same.
