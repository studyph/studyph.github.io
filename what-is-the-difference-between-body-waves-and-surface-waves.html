Refers to the emission of electromagnetic waves that carry energy away from the surface of the emitting body or object. _____2 Can take place even in a vacuum. _______3. Depends on the temperature of the emitting object. ______4. Takes place when the particles between objects or places that are in contact vibrate and collide at different speeds due to the difference in their temperature. ______5. When these particles collide, some of the energy from the more energetic particles is transferred to the less energetic particles, in the form of heat _____6. The particles at a higher temperature are more energetic and thus vibrate faster than the particles at a lower temperature.______ 7. This will then be replaced by the cooler water that goes down from above, which will, in turn, become warmer and also will rise to the top. _____8. Takes place only in fluids because it involves the movement of particles themselves from one place to another 9. The heat from the bottom part of the water is transferred to the upper part. ________10. As the water gets warmer, it expands and becomes lighter and so it rises at the top of the cooler water. ​</a>

                        Difference between body waves and surface waves<p>Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth. Body<strong> waves</strong> are moderately low-abundancy, incautious signs that, at teleseismic distances, proliferate along an assortment of ways through the profound mantle and center. Direct <strong>waves</strong>, surface reflections, and center reflections give inspecting of the mantle along interesting ways. Surface wave is a seismic <strong>wave</strong> that movements across the outside of the Earth instead of through it. Surface <strong>waves </strong>ordinarily have bigger amplitudes and longer frequencies than body <strong>waves, </strong>and they travel more leisurely than body waves do.surface waves propagate only at the interface between two different media, like the interface between Earth and atmosphere (i.e. the surface of the Earth).</p><p>What are waves? what are two types of waves?​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/2592838</p><p>#LetsStudy</p><br />

On the other hand, surface waves propagate only at the interface between two different media, like the interface between Earth and atmosphere (i.e. the surface of the Earth). . S-waves are shear waves. They only propagate in solid material.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

These waves are of a higher frequency than surface waves.<br /><br />SURFACE WAVES<br /><br />Travelling only through the crust, surface waves are of a lower frequency than body waves, and are easily distinguished on a seismogram as a result. Though they arrive after body waves, it is surface waves that are almost enitrely responsible for the damage and destruction associated with earthquakes. This damage and the strength of the surface waves are reduced in deeper earthquakes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Refers to the emission of electromagnetic waves that carry energy away from the surface of the emitting body or object. _____2 Can take place even in a vacuum. _______3. Depends on the temperature of the emitting object. ______4. Takes place when the particles between objects or places that are in contact vibrate and collide at different speeds due to the difference in their temperature. ______5. When these particles collide, some of the energy from the more energetic particles is transferred to the less energetic particles, in the form of heat _____6. The particles at a higher temperature are more energetic and thus vibrate faster than the particles at a lower temperature.______ 7. This will then be replaced by the cooler water that goes down from above, which will, in turn, become warmer and also will rise to the top. _____8. Takes place only in fluids because it involves the movement of particles themselves from one place to another 9. The heat from the bottom part of the water is transferred to the upper part. ________10. As the water gets warmer, it expands and becomes lighter and so it rises at the top of the cooler water. ​</h2><br />
