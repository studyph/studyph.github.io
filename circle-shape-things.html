                                            A Dream of School Supplies I had a dream of school supplies, where paperclips could talk; where poster paper hung around with marking pens and chalk. The stationery idled while the pencils madly raced. The clocks went ’round in circles, and the glue sticks merely paced. The binders were inseparable. They bonded with the tape. The workbooks exercised and helped the stencils stay in shape. Some calculators added to the numbers in this land, and music was provided by a singing rubber band. My dream was strange and truly cool, but this was even cooler: The dictionaries all looked up to me. I was the ruler. Comprehension Questions: 1. What can the paperclips do? 2. Which two things were inseparable? 3. What did the person talking in the poem become? 4. Can this happen in real life? Why or why not? 5. How should you take care of your school supplies?</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Solid figures are three-dimensional objects. What this means is that solid figures have a width, a depth, and a height. For example, look at your computer, laptop, phone, or whatever else you are using to view this lesson. Notice that it has a width, a depth, and a height.</p><p></p><p>This may make you think that solid figures are probably quite common in the environment around us, and you are right! Anything with those three dimensions (width, depth, and height) is a solid figure, and because we live in a three-dimensional world, these figures are all around us. In mathematics, there are many solid figures.</p><p></p><p>Let's look at these figures and some examples of them in our everyday life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            17. A lot of quadrilaterals are used in our daily life. In fact, many of the things we see in our daily life resemble geometric shapes like circle, quadrilateral, triangle, etc. Buildings, transportations, tools, toys, clothing, and even food, take some of these shapes for aesthetic appeal or for some practical reasons. Quadrilaterals are used in electronic devices like mobile phones, laptops, computers, TVs, etc. Why do you think these devices take the shape of a quadrilateral? How can these devices help in facing the challenges of the "new normal"?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quadrilaterals are used in electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, computers, TVs, etc. because they provide a basis for optimal design. By designing a device with a quadrilateral shape, it is possible to make more efficient use of space, create a more aesthetically pleasing form and make the device easier to use. </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the current "new normal" challenges, these devices can help in a number of ways. For example, they can provide access to online education, work-from-home support, social interaction, entertainment, and other activities. Additionally, they can be used to help people stay connected and informed, enabling them to perform their daily activities without having to leave their homes.</p><br />

                            18. A Dream of School Supplies I had a dream of school supplies, where paperclips could talk; where poster paper hung around with marking pens and chalk. The stationery idled while the pencils madly raced. The clocks went ’round in circles, and the glue sticks merely paced. The binders were inseparable. They bonded with the tape. The workbooks exercised and helped the stencils stay in shape. Some calculators added to the numbers in this land, and music was provided by a singing rubber band. My dream was strange and truly cool, but this was even cooler: The dictionaries all looked up to me. I was the ruler. Comprehension Questions: 1. What can the paperclips do? 2. Which two things were inseparable? 3. What did the person talking in the poem become? 4. Can this happen in real life? Why or why not? 5. How should you take care of your school supplies?</h2><br />
