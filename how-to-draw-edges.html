When creating an exploded assembly drawing, start by drawing the pictorial view of the object. _____4.Piece by piece, redraw the parts of the object spacing them equally. The pieces should all line up with their original position on the drawing. ______5. To draw exploded pictorial assembly drawing of the given pictorial view, first is to study the given pictorial view on how to detach one piece to the other to show the assembly. _____6. For final drawing, check the accuracy of your drawing and trace the visible edges with heavy lines. _____7.

                                            EXPLORE Using your bare hands will not guarantee that you will be able to draw a perfect circle. In drawing circles, we need a compass. A compass is an instrument used in drawing circles. Here are the steps in drawing circles using a compass. Insert a sharp pencil into the holder of the compass. Open the compass to the radius desired for your circle. The radius is the distance from the center point of the circle to the outer edge. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Place the compass point on a piece of paper where you would like the center point of the circle to be. Place the point of the pencil on the paper. Rotate the compass to mark a circle on the paper with the pencil. Draw without lifting the point of the compass off the paper. Try drawing circles with radii (plural form of the word radius) of 5 cm, 7 cm, and 8 cm, respectively. How about if you are tasked to draw very big circles? How will you do it?​</a>

The architect's side view drawing of a saltbox-style house shows a post that supports the roof ridge The support post is 10 ft tall. How far from the front of the house is the support post positioned? 2. To estimate the height of a stone figure, Anya holds a small square up to her eyes and walks backward from the figure. She stops when the bottom of the figure aligns with the bottom edge of the square and the top of the figure aligns with the top edge of the square. Her eye level is 1.84 m from the ground. She is 3.50 m from the figure. What is the height of the figure to the nearest hundredth of a meter? ? 3.50 m​</a>

Press the head of the T-square against the working edge of the drawing table and lean the pencil to the desired direction of the line inclined at more or less 60 degrees with the drawing table. Maintain the position of the pencil while you glide lightly on the blade of the T-square. 2. Drawing a Vertical Line Place the triangle on top of the blade of the T-square with the vertical edge on the left. Use 45 degrees triangle or 30 degrees x 60 degrees to draw vertical lines. With the left hand pressing the T-square and the triangle against the drawing board, draw the line upward, rotating the pencil slowly between the thumb and forefinger. See figure below. 3 Setting up Drawing Paper on the Drawing Table Press firmly the T-square against the working edge of the drawing table. on you if you are right or left-handed, while the paper is placed on top edge of the T-square. Fasten the upper left portion of the drawing paper followed by the lower right portion and finally the remaining corners.

We say the graph is planar if this is <strong>possible</strong> (since you can draw it on the plane). When a planar graph is drawn without the edges crossing, the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. Each area will be called a "<strong>face</strong>."

                            11. EXPLORE Using your bare hands will not guarantee that you will be able to draw a perfect circle. In drawing circles, we need a compass. A compass is an instrument used in drawing circles. Here are the steps in drawing circles using a compass. Insert a sharp pencil into the holder of the compass. Open the compass to the radius desired for your circle. The radius is the distance from the center point of the circle to the outer edge. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Place the compass point on a piece of paper where you would like the center point of the circle to be. Place the point of the pencil on the paper. Rotate the compass to mark a circle on the paper with the pencil. Draw without lifting the point of the compass off the paper. Try drawing circles with radii (plural form of the word radius) of 5 cm, 7 cm, and 8 cm, respectively. How about if you are tasked to draw very big circles? How will you do it?​</h2><br />
                        <p>To draw very big circles, use a template of a circle. You can easily find a template online, or you can purchase a template from a local store. Place the template on the paper and use a pencil to draw along the outline of the template. Trace the outline of the circle and draw as many circles as you need. This method will help you draw large circles quickly and precisely.</p><p></p><br />

She stops when the bottom of the figure aligns with the bottom edge of the square and the top of the figure aligns with the top edge of the square. Her eye level is 1.84 m from the ground. She is 3.50 m from the figure. What is the height of the figure to the nearest hundredth of a meter? ? 3.50 m​</h2><br />

                            21. Set-up 2Step 1: Roll the ball on the surface of the table. With your stop watch, take the time for the ball to reach the ground upon leaving the table’s edge and mark the point on the groundwhere the ball landed.Step 2: Repeat step 1 but this time, roll the ball at faster rate.Step 3: Record your observationsGuide Questions:1. How would you compare the time of fall when you rolled the ball at varied rates?2. How would you compare the distances of the point where the ball landed on the ground from the table’s edge?3. What relationship can you draw between the initial rolling speeds of the ball and the distances where the ball landed on the ground?​</h2><br />

Calculate the square root of the Step 2 result to find the time it takes the object to fall in seconds</p><p></p><p>2.For example, if the two points have coordinates (-3, 7) and (1, 2), then the difference between 7 and 2 is 5, and so Y = 5. Thus, the square of the distance between the coordinates is 41.

Maintain the position of the pencil while you glide lightly on the blade of the T-square. 2. Drawing a Vertical Line Place the triangle on top of the blade of the T-square with the vertical edge on the left. Use 45 degrees triangle or 30 degrees x 60 degrees to draw vertical lines. With the left hand pressing the T-square and the triangle against the drawing board, draw the line upward, rotating the pencil slowly between the thumb and forefinger. See figure below. 3 Setting up Drawing Paper on the Drawing Table Press firmly the T-square against the working edge of the drawing table. on you if you are right or left-handed, while the paper is placed on top edge of the T-square.
