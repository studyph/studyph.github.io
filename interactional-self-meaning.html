                                            The interaction between the Self and the other is related to the philosophical concept of intersubjectivity Similar to the word interpersonal, the word intersubjectivity is also comprise of three groups of letters and/or words, namely a inter = again this is a prefix which means 'between b subject = this refers to a person or thing that is being discussed with city = a suffix used to form nouns which expresses state or condition From this, we can conclude that intersubjectivity means a condition of relationship between subjects or persons. If I relate with a friend for example, and he or she relates back to me, intersubjectivity occurs Philosophically, this means that when the Self recognizes the Other and the other recognizes the Self, intersubjectivity happens.
