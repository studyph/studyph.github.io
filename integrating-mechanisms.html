Extreme cold may cause some types of nonmetallic conduits to become brittleand therefore, more susceptible to damage from physical contact.2. FPN in NEC and PEC means flexible print note.3. LTFNC can be used for areas or environment that are likely to get moist or wet.4. LTFNC can also be buried underground, as corrosion is not an issue in it.5. It is not advisable to use flexible nonmetallic conduit because it is moreexpensive than other types of conduit.6. Flexible nonmetallic conduit is used as mechanical protection for electricalconductors because it has a smooth interior and wall of non-conducting fibrousmaterials.7. A corrugated internal and external surface without integral reinforcementwithin the conduit wall is designated as type LFNC-B.8.

                                            AbstractCollagen is the main structural protein of most hard and soft tissues in animals and the human body, which plays an important rolein maintaining the biological and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provides physical support to tissues.Collagen can be extracted and purified from a variety of sources and offers low immunogenicity, a porous structure, goodpermeability, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen scaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering due to theseexcellent properties. However, the poor mechanical property of collagen scaffolds limits their applications to some extent. Toovercome this shortcoming, collagen scaffolds can be cross-linked by chemical or physical methods or modified withnatural/synthetic polymers or inorganic materials. Biochemical factors can also be introduced to the scaffold to further improve itsbiological activity. This review will summarize the structure and biological characteristics of collagen and introduce the preparationmethods and modification strategies of collagen scaffolds. The typical application of a collagen scaffold in tissue engineering(including nerve, bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament, blood vessel and skin) will be further provided. The prospects and challengesabout their future research and application will also be pointed out. View Full-TextKeywords collagen, biomaterial; scaffold; tissue engineering, extracellular matri​</a>

                                            3. Germany's centrality to all the key debates past and present which have preoccupied EU and Member State policy-makers - not the least of which is securing the future of the single currency is clear. It is and will remain essential to the success of integration in all its guises. However, its evolution as an actor in foreign and security policy represents perhaps the most interesting example of how it has changed since 1990. Having initially been anxious to reassure its neighbors and European partners that unification would not threaten the peace and stability of Europe, the trajectory of change within Germany has been dramatic in the post-unification period. While it has not been alone in seeking to wrestle with the security challenges thrown up first by the collapse of Yugoslavia, then the War on Terror, and more recently by the need for a coherent and effective crisis management mechanism to respond to instability in the EU's near-abroad, these have posed an additional and unique set of political and moral dilemmas.answer this.•Topic:  Торіс Focus: Field / Discipline: Terminilogies:​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Intermolecular force accounts for the many differences between substances. The three basic types you see in general chemistry are dipoles-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces occur from differences in charge and account for polarity.
</p><p>
</p><p>(In higher levels or more specific chem classes you’ll may talk about metallic bonding. Metals when grouped together form an “electron sea” where electrons move at will throughout a lattice of positively charged metal atoms. The sharing of making the lattices neutral but make it hard to separate. This is why metals have unique properties like high conductivity or strength.)
</p><p>
</p><p>The positive dipole of one molecule has an electric to the respective negative dipole in another molecule. This causes the molecules in a group to stick together “tighter” and be harder to separate. Because of this, substances with high IMF have higher melting/boiling points and lower vapor pressure.
</p><p>
</p><p>One can imagine that the molecules form polar magnet bars. If you mix them up, the respective ends will stick together and it will be hard to detangle them again like what happens when a substance changes into a higher energy state (solid to liquid/liquid to gas). Especially compare to non magnetized bars.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Pre-TestDirections: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if the statement is incorrect.1. Extreme cold may cause some types of nonmetallic conduits to become brittleand therefore, more susceptible to damage from physical contact.2. FPN in NEC and PEC means flexible print note.3. LTFNC can be used for areas or environment that are likely to get moist or wet.4. LTFNC can also be buried underground, as corrosion is not an issue in it.5. It is not advisable to use flexible nonmetallic conduit because it is moreexpensive than other types of conduit.6. Flexible nonmetallic conduit is used as mechanical protection for electricalconductors because it has a smooth interior and wall of non-conducting fibrousmaterials.7. A corrugated internal and external surface without integral reinforcementwithin the conduit wall is designated as type LFNC-B.8. Type LFNC-A has a smooth inner surface with integral reinforcement withinthe conduit's wall.9. Liquid tight flexible nonmetallic conduit shall not be used if there is physicaldamage.10. A smooth seamless inner core and cover bonded together and having one ormore reinforcement layers between the core and cover is designated as typeLFNC-B.​</h2><br />

                            19. AbstractCollagen is the main structural protein of most hard and soft tissues in animals and the human body, which plays an important rolein maintaining the biological and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provides physical support to tissues.Collagen can be extracted and purified from a variety of sources and offers low immunogenicity, a porous structure, goodpermeability, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen scaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering due to theseexcellent properties. However, the poor mechanical property of collagen scaffolds limits their applications to some extent. Toovercome this shortcoming, collagen scaffolds can be cross-linked by chemical or physical methods or modified withnatural/synthetic polymers or inorganic materials. Biochemical factors can also be introduced to the scaffold to further improve itsbiological activity. This review will summarize the structure and biological characteristics of collagen and introduce the preparationmethods and modification strategies of collagen scaffolds. The typical application of a collagen scaffold in tissue engineering(including nerve, bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament, blood vessel and skin) will be further provided. The prospects and challengesabout their future research and application will also be pointed out.

                            27. 3. Germany's centrality to all the key debates past and present which have preoccupied EU and Member State policy-makers - not the least of which is securing the future of the single currency is clear. It is and will remain essential to the success of integration in all its guises. However, its evolution as an actor in foreign and security policy represents perhaps the most interesting example of how it has changed since 1990. Having initially been anxious to reassure its neighbors and European partners that unification would not threaten the peace and stability of Europe, the trajectory of change within Germany has been dramatic in the post-unification period. While it has not been alone in seeking to wrestle with the security challenges thrown up first by the collapse of Yugoslavia, then the War on Terror, and more recently by the need for a coherent and effective crisis management mechanism to respond to instability in the EU's near-abroad, these have posed an additional and unique set of political and moral dilemmas.answer this.•Topic:  Торіс Focus: Field / Discipline: Terminilogies:​</h2><br />
