Starting from the school, a procession has to take the following route: 50m, north; 40m, cast; and 60 m, north. To go back, it has to follow the same route but in the opposite direction. (a) What is the total distance travelled? (b) What is the total displacement? 2. Maria walks to her school 360 m away at a constant speed of 3.0m/s. Ten seconds later, her brother Angelito follows at a constant speed of 4.0m/s. (a) How fast will Maria and Angelito reach their school? (b) Who will reach the school first? 3. A lady passenger steps on one end of a moving sidewalk in an airport terminal. The sidewalk is 50.0m long and is moving at 1.25 m/s. Find the time taken by the lady to reach the other end of the side walk (a) if the lady is standing still and (b) if she walks at 1.50 m/s relative to the moving side walk and in the same direction as the moving side walk. 4. Pedro is driving at 6.0 m/s when a traffic enforcer signals that he should speed up. He then steps on the gas and accelerated uniformly to a speed of 15 m/s in 4.5 s. Find the total distance Pedro travelled. 5. A 5.0 kg body has an acceleration of 2.5 m/s². How much force is acting on the body? 6. An astronaut weighs 931N here on Earth. (a) What is his mass on Earth? (b) What is his mass on the surface of the moon? (c) What is weight or how much force is acting on his body on the surface of the moon? (Hint: Use acceleration due to gravity as your acceleration. Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Earth is 9.8 m/s² while acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the moon is 1.62 m/s².) 7. A fireworks shell is accelerated from rest to a velocity of 65.0m/s over a distance of 250 m. (a) Calculate the acceleration. (b) How long did the acceleration last?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.(a) The total distance travelled by the procession is the sum of the distances travelled in each direction. The procession travels 50 m north, 40 m east, 60 m north, and 50 m south, for a total of 200 m. It also travels 40 m west and 60 m south, for a total of 100 m. Therefore, the total distance travelled is 200 m + 100 m = 300 m.</p><p>(b) The total displacement of the procession is the distance and direction from the starting point to the ending point. The starting point is at the school, and the ending point is at the school, so the total displacement is 0 m.</p><p></p><p>2. (a) The total distance travelled by Maria and Angelito is 360 m, and the time taken is 10 s + 360 m / 3.0 m/s = 120 s. Therefore, the average speed of Maria and Angelito is 360 m / 120 s = 3.0 m/s.</p><p>(b) Maria reaches the school at t = 360 m / 3.0 m/s = 120 s, and Angelito reaches the school at t = 360 m / 4.0 m/s = 90 s. Therefore, Angelito reaches the school first.</p><p></p><p>3. (a) If the lady is standing still, the time taken to reach the other end of the moving sidewalk is 50.0 m / 1.25 m/s = 40.0 s.</p><p>(b) If the lady walks at 1.50 m/s relative to the moving sidewalk, the time taken to reach the other end of the sidewalk is 50.0 m / (1.25 m/s + 1.50 m/s) = 25.0 s.</p><p></p><p>4. The acceleration of Pedro's car is 15 m/s - 6.0 m/s / 4.5 s = 2.0 m/s². The distance travelled during the acceleration can be calculated using the formula:</p><p></p><p>d = vt + 0.5at^2</p><p></p><p>5. Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the distance travelled is:</p><p></p><p>d = 6.0 m/s * 4.5 s + 0.5 * 2.0 m/s² * (4.5 s)^2</p><p></p><p>= 27 m + 40.5 m</p><p></p><p>= 67.5 m</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total distance travelled by Pedro is 67.5 m.</p><p></p><p>6. The force acting on a body is equal to the mass of the body multiplied by its acceleration. Therefore, the force acting on the 5.0 kg body is 5.0 kg * 2.5 m/s² = 12.5 N.</p><p></p><p>(a) The mass of the astronaut on Earth is given by the formula:</p><p></p><p>m = F/a</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the mass of the astronaut on Earth is:</p><p></p><p>m = 931 N / 9.8 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 95.3 kg</p><p></p><p>(b) The mass of the astronaut on the moon can be calculated using the same formula, with the acceleration due to gravity on the moon:</p><p></p><p>m = 931 N / 1.62 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 573 kg</p><p></p><p>(c) The weight of the astronaut on the surface of the moon can be calculated using the formula:</p><p></p><p>F = ma</p><p></p><p>Plugging in the values given in the problem, we find that the weight of the astronaut on the moon is:</p><p></p><p>F = 573 kg * 1.62 m/s²</p><p></p><p>= 931 N</p><p></p><p>7.
