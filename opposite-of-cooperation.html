Create an appropriategraphic organizer of your choice that highlights the author's idea about competitionand cooperationCompetition and Cooperation(1) Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation haveevolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined eachof them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was detinedas a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance,cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards aredistributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behavior among individuals. Bythis definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for eachcompetitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all membersof the group receive it(2) Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based uponrewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based uponrewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewedas opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component ofcompetition Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sportingevent or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important tounderstand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that samesporting event or ground rules of the15 game or election in order to compete.(3) Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "toseek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supportsthe understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the oppositeextreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor incompetition​</a>

                                            Competition and Coperation Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation have evolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined each of them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance, cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behaviour among individuals. By this definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for each competitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all members of the group receive it. Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based upon rewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based upon rewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewed as opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component of competition. Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sporting event or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important to understand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that same sporting event or ground rules of the game or election in order to compete. Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "to seek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supports the understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the opposite extreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor in competition.QUESTIONS 1.

Profits are also often returned back to the members of the cooperative, however, cooperatives are often more focused on services for members than for investments.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Cooperatives can be created for a number of different reasons or to fulfill a number of different needs: jointly process goods, split costs, split control over work, purchasing power (bulk buys), shared employees, shared wages, etc.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. Competition and Coperation Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation have evolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined each of them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance, cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behaviour among individuals. By this definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for each competitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all members of the group receive it. Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based upon rewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based upon rewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewed as opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component of competition. Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sporting event or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important to understand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that same sporting event or ground rules of the game or election in order to compete. Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "to seek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supports the understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the opposite extreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor in competition.QUESTIONS 1.

The units may be electrons per mole, atoms per mole, ions per mole, or molecules per mole. Determining which unit you'll have to use depends on the nature and character of the substance and of the reaction (if there's any involved reaction). Its value is approximately 6.022142 × 10²³.</p><p></p><p>In our case, we are given with the number of atoms, hence, the unit of Avogadro's constant we are going to use is atom per mole (atom/mol).</p><p></p><p>Now solving for the number of moles we have:</p><p></p><p>number of moles = 6,000,000 atoms ÷ 6.022142 × 10²³ atom/mol</p><p>number of moles = \frac{6,000,000 atom}{6.022142 x 10^2^3 atom/mol}</p><p>number of moles = 9.9632 × 10⁻¹⁸ moles (9.9632×10^-18 moles)</p><p>Notice that I've made the second line in terms of fraction so that the cancellation of the unit atom can be visible. The unit atom will be cancelled and the unit mole will be remain as it is what we are looking for.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there are 9.9632 × 10⁻¹⁸ moles of copper in 6,000,000 atoms of copper.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more example problems using moles here:</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2062141</p><p></p><p>Read more about Avogadro's constant here: https://brainly.ph/question/992008</p><p></p><p></p><p>#LetsStudy</p><p></p><br />
