Being fit is a way of saying a person eats well, gets a lot of physical activity and has a healthy weight. If you're fit, your body works well, feels good and can do all the things you want to do like running around with your friends. What does it feel like to be full? When you're eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Sometimes people eat too much because they don't notice when they need to stop eating. Eating too much can make you feel uncomfortable and over a period of time can lead to unhealthy weight gain. -Avenues in English 6 p.65 </a>

                        1. Your BMI is a measurement that is a ratio of your weight and height. It's a good way to gauge whether your weight is in healthy proportion to your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you – and your GP – determine any health risks you may face if it's outside of the healthy range.<p></p>2. To be physically fit you should have: 1) aerobic (cardiovascular) endurance, which is the ability of your heart and lungs to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity; 2) muscular endurance and strength to perform activity without fatigue and with the force needed to do the job; and 3) healthy body composition<br />

Errors in these areas require revising. Let us go back to the text we just read. Let us revise it together. Note: Teacher guides the pupils in revising the text. Being fit is a way of saying a person eats well, gets a lot of physical activity and has a healthy weight. If you're fit, your body works well, feels good and can do all the things you want to do like running around with your friends. What does it feel like to be full? When you're eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Sometimes people eat too much because they don't notice when they need to stop eating. Eating too much can make you feel uncomfortable and over a period of time can lead to unhealthy weight gain. -Avenues in English 6 p.65 </h2><br />
