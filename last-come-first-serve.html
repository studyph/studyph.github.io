                                            1 / 2Case Study #4BUILDING COST-SAVING CAPABILITIESRyanair is one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers and one of the world’s most profit- able airlines. Founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan, Liam Lonergan, and Tony Ryan, the original airline offered service from Waterford in southeastern Ireland to Gatwick in London. In its first full year of operation under partial European Union (EU) deregulation, the small airline obtained permission to challenge the duopoly of Air Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin–London route. With two routes and two planes, this small Irish airline was off and running. By 1991, the airline had been running continuous losses; it abandoned its business-class product and discontinued its frequent flyer club.To save the company from ruin and make the airline profitable, Michael O’Leary, the CEO, visited America to borrow ideas from Southwest Airlines, a well-established low- cost carrier. He returned with several key elements for a no-frills model, including the importance of quick turnaround times, no extras, and a single aircraft for operating efficiency. With an additional Ryan family investment of ð20 million, the firm emerged from restructuring as Europe’s first low-fare airline, making a profit for the first time. Deregulation of the European airline industry in 1992 gave carriers from any EU country the right to operate a schedule between other EU states, paving the way for Ryanair to begin launching new routes throughout Europe.Today the airline serves more than 42 million passengers, with 2007 profits of ð401.4 million. A comparison of 2007 to 2006 performance shows profit growth of 33 percent, traffic growth of 22 percent, revenue growth of 32 percent, and yield increases of 7 per- cent. Ryanair’s passenger numbers have grown by up to 25 percent per year for most of the last decade. With plans to double traffic and profits by 2012, Ryanair continues to execute on its low-cost strategy by offering low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a dedication to cost containment and operating efficiencies.The key elements of Ryanair’s strategy are low fares to stimulate demand, and customer service in the form of punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its primary competitors had. To accomplish these activities, Ryanair stresses quick turn- around times for aircraft, and chooses point-to-point short-haul routes to secondary and regional airports versus hub-and-spoke service. Short-haul and point-to-point service allows for direct nonstop service and avoids the cost of service for connecting passengers, including baggage transfer and passenger assistance. These regional airports offer lower landing and handling charges, faster turnaround times, less congestion, and fewer terminal delays. Ryanair negotiates extremely aggressive contracts with its airports, demanding low fees as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline plays airports off against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere if the airport does not make further concessions.Lower operating costs also come from aircraft equipment costs and personnel productivity. Operating a fleet of aircraft with a single model, the Boeing 737-800 series pro- vides operating efficiencies in maintenance and pilot scheduling. Taking advantage of the slump in airplane2 / 2sales, the company ordered Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 2001 at a substantial discount. Additional savings have come from more recent orders of aircraft without window shades, seat-back recline, or seat-back pockets. Reduced cleaning and repair costs for these planes have accompanied the savings of several hundred thousand dollars per aircraft when purchasing these bare-bones planes. Third parties are used at certain airports for passenger and aircraft handling, further lowering costs. Taking advantage of the Internet, direct selling to passengers through online bookings cuts out the cost of using travel agents, with the web site now handling 96 percent of all reservations. Ryanair does not employ an advertising agency, instead producing all of its advertising material in-house.With a clear and focused strategy as a low-cost carrier, future plans include manageable growth, continuing efforts to appeal the EU commission decision to prevent acquisition of Aer Lingus, and the possibility of entering into the long-haul market with a transatlantic low-cost airline.1.

                                            Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                            8. 1 / 2Case Study #4BUILDING COST-SAVING CAPABILITIESRyanair is one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers and one of the world’s most profit- able airlines. Founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan, Liam Lonergan, and Tony Ryan, the original airline offered service from Waterford in southeastern Ireland to Gatwick in London. In its first full year of operation under partial European Union (EU) deregulation, the small airline obtained permission to challenge the duopoly of Air Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin–London route. With two routes and two planes, this small Irish airline was off and running. By 1991, the airline had been running continuous losses; it abandoned its business-class product and discontinued its frequent flyer club.To save the company from ruin and make the airline profitable, Michael O’Leary, the CEO, visited America to borrow ideas from Southwest Airlines, a well-established low- cost carrier. He returned with several key elements for a no-frills model, including the importance of quick turnaround times, no extras, and a single aircraft for operating efficiency. With an additional Ryan family investment of ð20 million, the firm emerged from restructuring as Europe’s first low-fare airline, making a profit for the first time. Deregulation of the European airline industry in 1992 gave carriers from any EU country the right to operate a schedule between other EU states, paving the way for Ryanair to begin launching new routes throughout Europe.Today the airline serves more than 42 million passengers, with 2007 profits of ð401.4 million. A comparison of 2007 to 2006 performance shows profit growth of 33 percent, traffic growth of 22 percent, revenue growth of 32 percent, and yield increases of 7 per- cent. Ryanair’s passenger numbers have grown by up to 25 percent per year for most of the last decade. With plans to double traffic and profits by 2012, Ryanair continues to execute on its low-cost strategy by offering low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a dedication to cost containment and operating efficiencies.The key elements of Ryanair’s strategy are low fares to stimulate demand, and customer service in the form of punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its primary competitors had. To accomplish these activities, Ryanair stresses quick turn- around times for aircraft, and chooses point-to-point short-haul routes to secondary and regional airports versus hub-and-spoke service. Short-haul and point-to-point service allows for direct nonstop service and avoids the cost of service for connecting passengers, including baggage transfer and passenger assistance. These regional airports offer lower landing and handling charges, faster turnaround times, less congestion, and fewer terminal delays. Ryanair negotiates extremely aggressive contracts with its airports, demanding low fees as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline plays airports off against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere if the airport does not make further concessions.Lower operating costs also come from aircraft equipment costs and personnel productivity. Operating a fleet of aircraft with a single model, the Boeing 737-800 series pro- vides operating efficiencies in maintenance and pilot scheduling. Taking advantage of the slump in airplane2 / 2sales, the company ordered Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 2001 at a substantial discount. Additional savings have come from more recent orders of aircraft without window shades, seat-back recline, or seat-back pockets. Reduced cleaning and repair costs for these planes have accompanied the savings of several hundred thousand dollars per aircraft when purchasing these bare-bones planes. Third parties are used at certain airports for passenger and aircraft handling, further lowering costs. Taking advantage of the Internet, direct selling to passengers through online bookings cuts out the cost of using travel agents, with the web site now handling 96 percent of all reservations. Ryanair does not employ an advertising agency, instead producing all of its advertising material in-house.With a clear and focused strategy as a low-cost carrier, future plans include manageable growth, continuing efforts to appeal the EU commission decision to prevent acquisition of Aer Lingus, and the possibility of entering into the long-haul market with a transatlantic low-cost airline.1. What are the major contributors to Ryanair’s profitability?2. Would the acquisition of Aer Lingus complement Ryanair’s key capabilities?pls Po​​​</h2><br />

                            12. Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.
