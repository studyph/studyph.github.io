                                            The following are some lines from Helen Keller. Analyze each of them; then restate their meanings in your own words.1. " The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. "2. " when one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us. "3. " Believe, when you are most unhappy, that there is something for you to do in the world. So as long as you can sweeten another's pain, life is not in vain. "4. " Lifes is either a daring adventure or nothing. Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature. " ​</a>

Activity 3: Terraforming Mars Directions: Write a 200 word report/essay on the following topic: 'Can man alter Mars environment to make it more suitable for human habitation? How? Note: To “terraform" means to transform another planet to resemble the Earth in several aspects, specifically the ability to support life.​</h2><br />
                        <p>To a point, yes. It’s called terraforming, and its been written about extensively for over 50 years. I did an article on it a few years ago - How Do We Terraform Mars? - Universe Today - but it’s long and detailed, so here are the bullet points of it. Basically, if you’re going to alter the Martian environment for the sake of human habitation, you need to do three things.</p><p></p><p>Warm up the atmosphere</p><p></p><p>Thicken the atmosphere</p><p></p><p>Make the atmosphere breathable (i.e. a 70/30 oxygen/nitrogen gas split)</p><p></p><p>Luckily, all three of these goals are complementary, meaning the more you do to enhance one, the more you do to enhance the other two. And there are lots of ways of going about this, depending upon how much you’re willing to spend and what kind of space infrastructure you got at your disposal.</p><p></p><p>First, as Carl Sagan proposed, you could darken the surface of Mars around the poles so that they would absorb more solar radiation and melt. These could include dark, powdered minerals (like coal) or dark plants. Elon Musk has also recommended using nuclear devises to melt the polar ice caps, and others have suggested hurling meteors at them.</p><p></p><p>This would cause the ice caps to melt, releasing tons of vaporized water into the air and frozen carbon dioxide. The release of both would result in a thickening of the atmosphere and causing a Greenhouse Effect, which would warm the planet and allow more ice and permafrost beneath the surface to melt. In time, standing waters would form on the surface, covering much of the northern hemisphere.</p><p></p><p>Another way would be to hurl ammonia ices and frozen methane (which could be harvested from the outer Solar System) at the Martian surface. The impact would kick up dust and also sublimate the ices and release them into the atmosphere. Dust would allow for more solar radiation to be absorbed, and methane and ammonia are both super-greenhouse gases. Again, this would trigger a Greenhouse Effect and allow for liquid water to once again exist on the surface. And the ammonia could be converted to nitrogen gas, which would act as a buffer gas before oxygen gas could be produced.</p><p></p><p>The third step, which involves converting the atmosphere would be the longest and trickiest part. The Martian atmosphere is already mostly CO2, and with all the frozen CO2 released from the polar regions, you would be able to convert it to oxygen gas and carbon over time. This could be done by slowly introducing plants and vegetation to the surface, which would take root thanks to the presence of water and some serious nutrient solutions. Atmospheric processing stations could also be set up to slowly convert the CO2, or cyanobacteria could do the job (as it did on primordial Earth).</p><p></p><p>Another major issue is ensuring that the atmosphere is protected from solar wind, which was how Mars lost its primordial atmosphere billions of years ago. One way to do this would be to try and restart action in the core, which would be very costly and difficult. Another way would be to position a magnetic shield in orbit around Mars L1 Lagrange Point, which would shield its atmosphere from solar wind and also allow it to thicken naturally over time.</p><p></p><p>There are other means, but the ones listed above cover all the basics. After you’ve done all that, and allowed for a few centuries or even millennia for the process to take hold, Mars would no longer be the Red Planet, it would be a second “Blue Marble”. And with people there to ensure that the atmosphere was monitored and thickened from time to time, it would be able to remain the war.</p><br />

                        <p>There is already, compared to the hundreds of billions of buying for long term and buying for short term profits, minimal short selling.</p><p></p><p>Short selling is a limited profit opportunity that is used by one of the smallest market participant groups.</p><p></p><p>Any reduction, either by regulation, by short sellers halting their activity, or the natural decline in short selling due to a strong moderately trending stock market, is likely to have minimal to no visible impact for retail investors and retail traders.</p><p></p><p>You won’t see much difference. The ebb and flow of selling short is based on the bear to bull market cycles. When a bear market is causing stocks to fall OR when a bull market is nearing the end of its cycle with huge speculation in stock prices and massive risk taking, enormous leveraging, and investors buying into rising risk prior to the peak of a bull cycle.</p><p></p><p>Those are the two times when selling short increases for a brief period of time.</p><p></p><p>If there were no sell shorting, then when a market was stressed, the prices would fall faster, deeper, and the losses would be greater. WHY? When there are more sellers than buyers, aka the demand is collapsing someone must be on the BUY SIDE to buy what everyone wants to sell.</p><p></p><p>That role, has traditionally been the responsibility of the Market Makers of the stock market. Market Makers are the original short sellers. When a market is obviously speculated beyond all reasonable common sense, Market Makers will set up sell shorts to prepare for the avalanche of sellers. As panicked investors sell, the Market Makers Buy to Cover, thereby making some profit on their Market Making responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Short Sellers who are Hedge Funds enter similarly with a similar intent. However, the Hedge Funds are not a huge market group. The Market Makers actually have more capital in action.</p><br />

                            12. The following are some lines from Helen Keller. Analyze each of them; then restate their meanings in your own words.1. " The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. "2. " when one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us. "3. " Believe, when you are most unhappy, that there is something for you to do in the world. So as long as you can sweeten another's pain, life is not in vain. "4. " Lifes is either a daring adventure or nothing. Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature. " ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The things that are most valuable and beautiful in the world cannot be perceived by our senses, but rather, they are felt through our emotions and experiences.</p><p></p><p>2. When we face disappointment or failure, we should not dwell on what we cannot change. Instead, we should keep an open mind and look for new opportunities that may arise.</p><p></p><p>3. Even when we are going through difficult times, we can find purpose and meaning in our lives by helping others and making a positive impact on the world.</p><p></p><p>4. Life is a journey that should be approached with courage and a willingness to take risks, as seeking security in life is a futile effort due to its unpredictable nature.</p><br />
