For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,For ever panting, and for ever young; All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,tongue.A burning forehead, and a parchingWho are these coming to the sacrifice? To what green altar, O mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken flanks with garlandsdrest?What little town by river or sea shore, Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this folk, this piousmorn?And, little town, thy streets for evermore Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e'erreturn.O Attic shape!

                                            The following is a part of a literature review from the study of Avilla (2012) entitled “On Life, Music and Meanings: An Ethnographic Account of a Blind Street Musician.”DIRECTIONS: Read the selection provided below and answer the guide questions that follow. Use your own words and write your answers on a separate word file and submit it via LMS.Music is melodic; it moves the passions (for good or ill) and is a fundamental human activity affecting our emotions by being stirring and martial, or beautiful and enticing. Its purposes could thus be considered as aligned with those of the science of rhetoric, which aimed to bend human minds and actions to the purposes of the orator. On the other side, music, in the theories erected on the basis of the laws of number and could thus be viewed as reflecting abstract and immanent of the universe such as the principles of natural order, or the workings of the divine (James, 1993 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolber, 2008).This is the dichotomous view of music that persisted until the first millennium. However, in the medieval world, music can be thought of as having meaning in at least two domains, the human and the divine. The domains now possessed quite different values; that which was oriented towards the divine has immeasurably higher value than that which was merely secular or bodily. At the extreme, it was not so much music as the theory of music that had meaning in the sphere of the divine order or cosmos in its proportions and forms could be allowed as having meaning in the appropriate domain (Sparshott &amp; Goehr, 2001 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).Music came to be seen as a foundationally human activity with its values and its meanings requiring to be expressed and interpreted in human rather than in divine forms (Palisca, 1985 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008). Music’s meanings were bound to the product and processes of human reason as well as to the music’s effects on human emotions, allowing for the possibility that music might express of bear types of meanings that were proper only to music as an art (Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).GUIDE QUESTIONS:1. What do you think is the study all about?2. What constructs or theme can you draw from the excerpt?3. What citation did the author use?

Land of the morning, child of the sun returning,
With fervor burning, Thee do our souls adore.
Land dear and holy, Cradle of noble heroes,
Ne’er shall invaders trample thy sacred shore.
Ever within thy skies 
And through thy clouds
And o’er thy hills and sea,
Do we behold the radiance 
Feel and throb of glorious liberty.
Thy banner, dear to all our hearts,
Its sun and stars alight,
O never shall its shining field
Be dimmed by tyrant’s might!
Beautiful land of love, O land of light,
In thine embrace ’tis rapture to lie,
But it is glory ever, when thou art wronged,
For us, thy sons to suffer and die.</a>

A</p><p></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p><strong>Landscape painting, </strong>also known as landscape art, is the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view—with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects.</p><p>The ideologist of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism played important roles in <strong>East Asian art. </strong><strong>Chinese art</strong> does not express the human understanding of the relationship between nature and humans. These are the Principles of Chinese Painting established by Xie HE to make the painting interesting and realistic, except.</p><p><strong>Landscape painting </strong>represents both a portrayal of nature itself and a codified illustration of the human view of nature and the world. Within the powerful, awe-inspiring landscape, the human figure appears in diminutive form, or not at all.</p><p><strong>Calligraphy, </strong>the art of beautiful writing, was long considered the supreme art form in China, Japan, and Korea. This elevated status reflects the importance of the written word in East Asian cultures.</p><p><strong>Straight inclined</strong>: Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures.</p><p><strong>Multi-inclined</strong>: Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces. Sweeping: Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof.</p><p>The subject matter that is widely regarded as most characteristic of <strong>Japanese painting</strong>, and later printmaking, is the depiction of scenes from everyday life and narrative scenes that are often crowded with figures and detail.</p><p><strong>Korean painting</strong> includes paintings made in Korea or by overseas Koreans on all surfaces. It includes art as old as the petroglyphs through post-modern conceptual art using transient forms of light. Calligraphy rarely occurs in oil paintings and is dealt with in the brushwork entry, Korean calligraphy.</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong> <strong>#</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>S</strong></p><p></p><p>- PxtriciaHeart</p><br />

What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wildecstasy?Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, playon;Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leaveThy song, nor ever can those trees be bare; Bold Lover, never, never canst thoukiss,Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,For ever wilt thou love, and she befair!Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed Your leaves, nor ever bid the Springadieu:And, happy melodist, unwearied,For ever piping songs for ever new; More happy love! more happy, happy love!

                            18. The following is a part of a literature review from the study of Avilla (2012) entitled “On Life, Music and Meanings: An Ethnographic Account of a Blind Street Musician.”DIRECTIONS: Read the selection provided below and answer the guide questions that follow. Use your own words and write your answers on a separate word file and submit it via LMS.Music is melodic; it moves the passions (for good or ill) and is a fundamental human activity affecting our emotions by being stirring and martial, or beautiful and enticing. Its purposes could thus be considered as aligned with those of the science of rhetoric, which aimed to bend human minds and actions to the purposes of the orator. On the other side, music, in the theories erected on the basis of the laws of number and could thus be viewed as reflecting abstract and immanent of the universe such as the principles of natural order, or the workings of the divine (James, 1993 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolber, 2008).This is the dichotomous view of music that persisted until the first millennium. However, in the medieval world, music can be thought of as having meaning in at least two domains, the human and the divine. The domains now possessed quite different values; that which was oriented towards the divine has immeasurably higher value than that which was merely secular or bodily. At the extreme, it was not so much music as the theory of music that had meaning in the sphere of the divine order or cosmos in its proportions and forms could be allowed as having meaning in the appropriate domain (Sparshott &amp; Goehr, 2001 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).Music came to be seen as a foundationally human activity with its values and its meanings requiring to be expressed and interpreted in human rather than in divine forms (Palisca, 1985 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008). Music’s meanings were bound to the product and processes of human reason as well as to the music’s effects on human emotions, allowing for the possibility that music might express of bear types of meanings that were proper only to music as an art (Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).GUIDE QUESTIONS:1. What do you think is the study all about?2. What constructs or theme can you draw from the excerpt?3. What citation did the author use?

Filipinas by Jose Palma
Land of the morning, child of the sun returning,
With fervor burning, Thee do our souls adore.
Land dear and holy, Cradle of noble heroes,
Ne’er shall invaders trample thy sacred shore.
Ever within thy skies 
And through thy clouds
And o’er thy hills and sea,
Do we behold the radiance 
Feel and throb of glorious liberty.
Thy banner, dear to all our hearts,
Its sun and stars alight,
O never shall its shining field
Be dimmed by tyrant’s might!
Beautiful land of love, O land of light,
In thine embrace ’tis rapture to lie,
But it is glory ever, when thou art wronged,
For us, thy sons to suffer and die.</h2><br />
