Relative book values</p><p>Relative book value is the value of something as shown on bookkeeping records as distinguished from market value. The book value of a company is the difference in value between that company's total assets and total liabilities on its balance sheet. Value investors use the price-to-book (P/B) ratio to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value to identify potentially overvalued and undervalued stocks.</p><p><strong>B. Relative Market Values</strong></p><p>Market value is the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace, or the <strong>value that the investment community gives to a particular equity or business.</strong> The primary goal of determining market value is to provide a fair assessment of the worth or value of the asset. In simple terms, it is the price at which the item would normally be sold. Buyers have the option of paying, while <strong>sellers also have the option of accepting more or less than market value.</strong></p><p>C. Relatives Par Values</p><p>Par value is the value of a single common share as set by a corporation's charter. It is not typically related to the actual value of the shares. In fact it is often lower. Any stock certificate issued for shares purchased shows the par value. When authorizing shares, a company can choose to assign a par value or not.</p><p></p><p>Based on the description above <strong>Relative Market Value</strong> is the correct answer</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>Market prices tend to be relatively low in a very competitive business for thereason that https://brainly.ph/question/10242293</p><p>#SPJ4</p><p></p><br />
