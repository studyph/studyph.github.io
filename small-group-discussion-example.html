Examples of light physical activityinclude walking slowly, playing pool (billiards), croquet, fishing, and light housework such ascooking, dusting, ironing, folding laundry, washing dishes, and putting away groceries. Thestudy found that replacing 30 minutes a day of sitting time with light activity was linked with alonger life expectancy. More intense activity was linked with even greater health benefits. Thestudy was published March 25, 2019 in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Lots of research links physical activity with a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease,and death. Research also shows that long hours spent sitting, no matter how much exerciseyou get otherwise, is linked with a higher risk of disease and death. That prompted the AmericanCancer Society to study the effect of replacing sitting time with light levels of activity, and withmoderate-to-vigorous levels of activity. Examples of moderate activity include brisk walking anddancing. Vigorous activity includes jogging, running, and soccer.The study included almost 38,000 men and almost 55,000 women in the Cancer PreventionStudy-Il Nutrition Cohort from 1999 - 2014.Among those who got 17 minutes a day or less of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity- the least active group -- replacing 30 minutes of sitting a day with light physical activity was-linked with a 14% lowered risk of dying during the study period. Replacing sitting with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was linked with a 45% lower risk of dying. For the most activegroup, those who got more than 38 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,the researchers did not see a benefit.The authors conclude that replacing small amounts of sitting time with even lightphysical activity may help less active adults live longer, including older adults. ErikaRees Punia, PhD, lead author of the study and Post-Doctoral Fellow at the American CancerSociety, suggests less active adults should include more light activities during their leisure timeas well as working it into their work and home routines.​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 2. READ AND LEARN LESSON FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNICATION Communication plays an important role in your life. It serves many functions in order to help you share thoughts and ideas with individuals and with groups of people. Basically, the functions of communication are as follows: control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. 1. Every communication situation bears any of the following functions discussed below. Communication functions as a form of CONTROL. Communication helps regulate actions and behavior. A traffic enforcer calling your attention whenever you, as a pedestrian or a driver, violate traffic rules, is an example of this function. This function may likely happen whenever your parents at home or your teachers at school impose rules and regulations to follow and abide to. If you happen to violate these rules and regulations, a corresponding punishment may be given to you in order to establish the value of discipline on your part. 2. Communication functions to allow SOCIAL INTERACTION. Communication is meant for sharing and conveying messages, expressions and information. There is no better way to share your thoughts and ideas but through social interaction. This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</a>

What is itTpluActivity 3: This must be newProcedure: Read the paragraph and make markings on the important things discussedA new study from researchers at the American Cancer Society finds that even lightlevels of physical activity are healthier than just sitting. Examples of light physical activityinclude walking slowly, playing pool (billiards), croquet, fishing, and light housework such ascooking, dusting, ironing, folding laundry, washing dishes, and putting away groceries. Thestudy found that replacing 30 minutes a day of sitting time with light activity was linked with alonger life expectancy. More intense activity was linked with even greater health benefits. Thestudy was published March 25, 2019 in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Lots of research links physical activity with a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease,and death. Research also shows that long hours spent sitting, no matter how much exerciseyou get otherwise, is linked with a higher risk of disease and death. That prompted the AmericanCancer Society to study the effect of replacing sitting time with light levels of activity, and withmoderate-to-vigorous levels of activity. Examples of moderate activity include brisk walking anddancing. Vigorous activity includes jogging, running, and soccer.The study included almost 38,000 men and almost 55,000 women in the Cancer PreventionStudy-Il Nutrition Cohort from 1999 - 2014.Among those who got 17 minutes a day or less of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity- the least active group -- replacing 30 minutes of sitting a day with light physical activity was-linked with a 14% lowered risk of dying during the study period. Replacing sitting with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was linked with a 45% lower risk of dying. For the most activegroup, those who got more than 38 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,the researchers did not see a benefit.The authors conclude that replacing small amounts of sitting time with even lightphysical activity may help less active adults live longer, including older adults. ErikaRees Punia, PhD, lead author of the study and Post-Doctoral Fellow at the American CancerSociety, suggests less active adults should include more light activities during their leisure timeas well as working it into their work and home routines.​</h2><br />

This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</h2><br />
