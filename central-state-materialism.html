This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</a>

Which conditiondoes not distinctly describe an El Niño event?A. It is an oscillation of the ocean-temperature system in the tropical Pacific having important consequences for weatherand climate around the globe.B. The trade winds blow towards the west across the tropical Pacific. These winds pile up warm surface water in the westPacific, so that the sea surface is about 1/2 meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador.C. The trade winds relax in the central and western Pacific leading to a depression of the thermocline in the easternPacific, and an elevation of the thermocline in the west.D. The easterly trade winds weaken. Rainfall follows the warm water eastward, with associated flooding in Peru anddrought in Indonesia and Australia.8.

‘Ambo’ intensifies into severe tropical storm
MANILA - Weather disturbance Ambo has intensified into a severe tropical storm, as it moved closer towards Eastern Visayas and the Bicol Region, the state weather bureau said Wednesday.
In its 5 p.m. bulletin, PAGASA said Ambo was spotted at 4 p.m. approximately 315 kilometers east of Borongan City, Eastern Samar. It was packing maximum sustained winds of up to 95 kilometers per hour near the center with 115 kph gusts.
It was last seen moving west northwest at 10 kph.
PAGASA said Ambo is expected to further intensify as it approaches Eastern Visayas and the Bicol Region.
On Wednesday night, scattered light to moderate with at times heavy rainshowers during thunderstorms will prevail over Eastern Visayas.
On Thursday, moderate to heavy rains will be experienced in Eastern Visayas, Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon and Masbate.

"The BNPP was already high-tech when it was constructed in the early 1980s and before it was set to operate, upgrades were made, particularly the cooling system. only the best materials, components and design were used for the facility. safety protocols that were implemented here at par with other nuclear power plants in the world" ani punzalan. dagdag pa niya, kabilang sa istruktura ang BNPP ang umano'y state-of-the-art seismic design na kung saan ang mga dingding nito ay hindi pantay-pantay upang maiwasan ang pagbbiyak ng mga konkreto nito sakaling lumindol. ​</a>

                                            vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</h2><br />

                            27. vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!
