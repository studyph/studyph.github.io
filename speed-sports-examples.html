                                            l-Related Physical Fitness 1. Agility - is the ability to change and control the direction and position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid motion; for example, changing directions to hit a tennis ball. 2. Balance - is the ability to control or stabilize the body when a person is standing still or moving; for example, in-line skating. 3. Coordination - is the ability to use the senses together with body parts during movement; for example, dribbling a basketball. Using hands and eyes together is called hand-eye coordination. 4. Speed - is the ability to move your body or parts of your body swiftly. Many sports rely on speed to gain advantage over your opponents; for example, a basketball player making a fast break to perform a lay-up, a tennis player moving forward to get to a drop shot, and a football player outrunning the defense to receive a pass. 5. Power - is the ability to move the body parts swiftly while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power is a combination of both speed and muscular strength; for example, fullbacks in football muscling their way through other players and speeding to advance the ball and volleyball players getting up to the net and lifting their bodies high into the air.6. Reaction Time - is the ability to reach or respond quickly to what you hear, see, or feel; for example, an athlete quickly coming off the blocks early in a swimming or track relay, or stealing a base in baseball.

                            20. l-Related Physical Fitness 1. Agility - is the ability to change and control the direction and position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid motion; for example, changing directions to hit a tennis ball. 2. Balance - is the ability to control or stabilize the body when a person is standing still or moving; for example, in-line skating. 3. Coordination - is the ability to use the senses together with body parts during movement; for example, dribbling a basketball. Using hands and eyes together is called hand-eye coordination. 4. Speed - is the ability to move your body or parts of your body swiftly. Many sports rely on speed to gain advantage over your opponents; for example, a basketball player making a fast break to perform a lay-up, a tennis player moving forward to get to a drop shot, and a football player outrunning the defense to receive a pass. 5. Power - is the ability to move the body parts swiftly while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power is a combination of both speed and muscular strength; for example, fullbacks in football muscling their way through other players and speeding to advance the ball and volleyball players getting up to the net and lifting their bodies high into the air.6. Reaction Time - is the ability to reach or respond quickly to what you hear, see, or feel; for example, an athlete quickly coming off the blocks early in a swimming or track relay, or stealing a base in baseball.

But where performance is concerned, the greatest improvements arise from training that develops the skills specifically related to your activity of choice.</p><p></p><p>For instance, you need cardiovascular endurance and flexibility to play tennis. But to become good at tennis, you have to work on skill-related fitness components like agility, power, speed, and hand-eye coordination. It's this focus on activity-related skills that differentiate two distinct areas of fitness development.</p><p></p><p>Getting Fit vs. Improving Performance</p><p>The health-related components of fitness are important for everyone, in all walks of life, regardless of whether they have a desire to compete in or perform a physical activity at an optimum level. They are:</p><p></p><p>Body composition</p><p>Cardiovascular endurance</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>Muscular endurance</p><p>Muscular strength</p><p>When you improve your cardiovascular endurance, you reduce the risk of heart disease. When you improve your flexibility, you maintain a healthy range of motion, which improves your ability to perform activities of daily living, like picking things up off the floor or stretching to reach items on high shelves.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
