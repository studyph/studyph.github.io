Principles and Elements of design will greatly The personality of the wearer shows the kind of image she/he projects. Introvert persons prefer clothes of simple yet classical cut with pastel or light colors. Extrovert persons are creative, artistic, expressive and energetic. They prefer clothing that is comfortable, attractive and fashionable. They can wear all kinds of clothing of varied style, colors and design with confidence. In this lesson you will be able to assess the appropriateness of design based on the clients' features and read specification and apply the principle of design and color harmonies. Principles of Design •Symmetrical or the formal balance -having equal "weight" on equal sides of a From the centrally placed like a see saw. This is an easy way of balancing but lends mo centered of notony to the design. the dress, •Asymmetrical or the informal balance - The structure decoration and accesso design should ries are different both sides from the center of the design. be identified •Radial the design are at equal distance from a central point;A man wearing a on both sides sun design on the front of his shirt may have this kind of design. RHYTHM These are smooth movement lines repeated again and again. It is created by repeated use of the design. If there is rhythm in a de- sign, the eye would move easily from one part to the other EMPHASIS Every pleasing design has one part that is more interesting than any other. The center of interest. HARMONY It is the blending of all components of design. When the structural lines, decorative lines, colors and accessories all relate to each other comfortably, harmony results PROPOR- The pleasing relationship of all parts of the object with one anoth- TION er. Proportion refers to the relative size and scale of the various elements in a design. The issue is the relationship between ob- jects, or parts, of a whole. ELEMENTS OF DESIGN 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The principles of design are the rules a designer must follow to create an effective and attractive composition. The fundamental principles of design are Emphasis, Balance and Alignment, Contrast, Repetition, Proportion, Movement and White Space.</p><p></p><p>Design differs from art in that it has to have a purpose. Visually, this functionality is interpreted by making sure an image has a center of attention, a point of focus. Maybe you’re thinking, ‘But wait! I thought design was all about creativity?’ If you’re an entrepreneur or designer who’s just starting out, you might be tempted to go wild and combine the first five typefaces and colors that catch your eye, believing you’re creating something fresh and new. You will probably find yourself with a design that is muddled, unfinished, or well, just plain ugly.</p><p></p><p>Graphic design, like any discipline, adheres to strict rules that work beneath the surface to make the work stable and balanced. If the work is missing that balance, it will be weak and ineffective.</p><p></p><p>This article will take you through 7 basic principles of design that will make your next project stand outSay you’re creating a poster for a concert. You should ask yourself: what is the first piece of information my audience needs to know? Is it the band? Or the concert venue? What about the day and the cost of attending?</p><p></p><p>Make a mental outline. Let your brain organize the information and then lay out your design in a way that communicates that order. If the band’s name is the most essential information, place it in the center or make it the biggest element on the poster. Or you could put it in the strongest, boldest type. Learn about color theory and use strong color combinations to make the band name pop.</p><p></p><p>Like writing without an outline or building without a blueprint, if you start your composition without a clear idea of what you’re trying to communicate, your design will not succeed.</p><br />
