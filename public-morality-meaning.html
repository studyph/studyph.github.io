                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                                            Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3. Who should be involved in developing employee outcomes/objectives? 4. How do you think the problem will be addressed using proper communication?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Catholic Church proclaims that human life is sacred and that the dignity of the human person is the foundation of a moral vision for society. This belief is the foundation of all the principles of our social teaching. In our society, human life is under direct attack from abortion and euthanasia. The value of human life is being threatened by cloning, embryonic stem cell research, and the use of the death penalty. The intentional targeting of civilians in war or terrorist attacks is always wrong. Catholic teaching also calls on us to work to avoid war. Nations must protect the right to life by finding increasingly effective ways to prevent conflicts and resolve them by peaceful means. We believe that every person is precious, that people are more important than things, and that the measure of every institution is whether it threatens or enhances the life and dignity of the human person.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps<strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>D</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>K</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p>Thank u</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>he would certainly punish the young farmer for disobeying his order</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I'M NOT SURE</p><br />

                            21. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                            23. Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3. Who should be involved in developing employee outcomes/objectives? 4. How do you think the problem will be addressed using proper communication?​</h2><br />
