                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7.

                            7. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                            15. ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7. CNOCRETE This diction refers to the use of words for their literal meanings and often refer to things that appeal to the senses. The meaning is not open to interpretation because the writer is specific and detailed in their phrasing. For example, the sentence: “I ate an apple.” 8. POEITC This is driven by lyrical words that relate to a specific theme reflected in a poem, and create a euphonious, or harmonious, sound. It usually involves the u​</h2><br />
