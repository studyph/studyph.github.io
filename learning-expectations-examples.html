                                            What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.

Edwards (2007) explored the process of college men’s gender identity development. In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.

To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle, often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager's expectation of success or failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. (Adapted from Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4'e © Cengage Learning) Main Idea: Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees.Support 1. People are likely to live up to a manager or superior expectations.2. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you will get it. 3.a. leader who expects the best gets high achievementb. leader who doesn't expect much gets low achievementC.d. pays for leaders to expect the best​</a>

                            3. explain how teachers expectation can influence students motivation and learning performance.give examples​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Culturally diverse students, like all students, are vulnerable to teacher expectations. The Rosenthal and Jacobson study of 1968 was the first full-length study to suggest that teacher expectations, even when based on erroneous information, can influence the academic performance of children. This harmful practice is commonly known as the Pygmalion Effect.
</p><p>
</p><p>The educational difficulties that they experience later on in life can be correlated with a lack of motivation or encouragement from teachers while they were in elementary school. If no interventions are implemented early on, this will manifest itself into learned helplessness later on in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also damaging are the comments often heard in the teacher’s lounge such as “That Maurice never does his homework” or “Malcolm is always causing problems.” Instead of permitting negative first impressions to become permanent opinions, teachers can attempt to build a classroom environment in which every child is valued, challenged, and expected to succeed.
</p><p>
</p><p>In my early years, I remember the teachers who encouraged me to live up to my academic potential, but I also remember others who only paid attention to those children they deemed worthy of their attention—the children of professionals and business owners. It was as if the rest of us were destined to work at the neighborhood fast food restaurant or at a local factory, so we weren’t worth the time and effort.
</p><p>
</p><p>Teachers must realize that even the child with poor manners and aggressive tendencies has potential. Even though they might get on your nerves from time to time, never forget that you have been charged with a duty to educate every child. You don’t choose the profession; the profession ultimately chooses you. You must take a vow to change the world without letting the world change you.
</p><p>
</p><p>Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) originally proposed that teacher expectations act as self-fulfilling prophecies because student achievement reflects expectations. Once teachers form expectations, they convey them to students through smiles, eye contact, and supportive and friendly actions. Low teacher expectations have been identified as a significant obstacle to academic achievement for disenfranchised learners.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is difficult to put aside our biases concerning the abilities of disadvantaged students, but it is a critical first step toward effectively educating disenfranchised youth. Teachers must enter the instructional arena with the belief that all students can and will learn. Lowering academic standards and giving students easy, watered-down assignments set the stage for reduced student achievement.
</p><p>
</p><p>Teachers should not accept excuses for poor performance, nor should they develop expectations based on ethnicity or family income or any other factor unrelated to student performance. What did we miss?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Things I already know:</strong></p><p>I already know that dressmaking is the craft of sewing clothes and dresses. Also, I already know that the craft requires  concentration and hand-eye coordination.</p><p><strong>Things I want to know:</strong></p><p>I want to know how to sketch patterns, pick the desired fabric and cut out the patterns.</p><p><strong>Things I expect to know: </strong></p><p>I expect to know how to cut the patterns out and put the pieces together. Also, I expect to know how to utilize my sewing skills in making unique outfits. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Dressmaking courses teach the art of creating unique garments to suit an individual's specific requirements, body shape, fitting preferences, and/or personal taste. Because dressmakers are specialists in the many elements of garment creation, their skills can also be used to customize, alter and repair older clothing.</p><p>Note: The assessment tool is used by the teacher to diagnose your knowledge and skills and to determine how to better help you as you go through the course. </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps you.

                            5. What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.
What did you learn from the selection?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I learned that values are taught at home. It starts in the family. Parents will plant the values in their children, then school will cultivate the seed. Then both parents and teachers help the students' value grow</p><br />

In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.

                            28. Activity 3 Read each paragraph. Then fill in the blanks in the outlines that follow.1. What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle, often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager's expectation of success or failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. (Adapted from Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4'e © Cengage Learning) Main Idea: Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees.Support 1. People are likely to live up to a manager or superior expectations.2. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you will get it. 3.a. leader who expects the best gets high achievementb. leader who doesn't expect much gets low achievementC.d. pays for leaders to expect the best​</h2><br />
