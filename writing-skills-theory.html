TRUE OR FALSE. In a piece of paper, write TRUE if the statement tells of a
truth about organization theories and its applications to business; otherwise,
write FALSE

temporary theories.
2. Under the modern theories are organizational designs such as the
team design, matrix-project design and the boundary-less design.
3. Simple design is the most basic where the owner also serves as the
manager of the business and all authority and responsibilities rest on

4. A boundary-less design is an organizational structure that requires a
project member/employee to report and communicate to two
superiors.
5. Functional design takes into consideration the employees&#039; expertise
and skills in grouping or assigning them into specific units.</p>

Creativity broadly refers to an ability or activity that produces something new and useful. It's assessments appears to become increasingly important because creativity has enduring effects throughout the individual's lifespan (Mouchiroud &amp; Lobart 2001). However attempts to devise a unitary measure of overall creativity have not been successful (Fishikin &amp; Johnson, 1998). It is therefore preferable to adopt a systems approach to the assessment by using multiple measures to tap various dimensions of creativity (Fishikin &amp; Johnson, 1998). As such, creativity involves skills enabling an individual to reconstruct a fuller picture. B.Creativity is a hot topic in Hong Kong nowadays. What does being creative mean actually? if you come up with a new useful idea, we can say that you are creative!! But how can we measure it? We should think of a way to measure creativity because it's having a bigger and bigger effect on our lives all the time. But we have not still succeeded in finding a good way. Gestalt theory gives us a better idea of what being creative means. For example it means that you can improve things or 'think out of the box' or be very open-minded and curious about things, etc. In a nutshell, creative people are able to use skills to fill in the gaps.​</a>

Creativity broadly refers to an ability or activity that produces something new and useful. It's assessments appears to become increasingly important because creativity has enduring effects throughout the individual's lifespan (Mouchiroud &amp; Lobart 2001). However attempts to devise a unitary measure of overall creativity have not been successful (Fishikin &amp; Johnson, 1998). It is therefore preferable to adopt a systems approach to the assessment by using multiple measures to tap various dimensions of creativity (Fishikin &amp; Johnson, 1998). As such, creativity involves skills enabling an individual to reconstruct a fuller picture. B.Creativity is a hot topic in Hong Kong nowadays. What does being creative mean actually? if you come up with a new useful idea, we can say that you are creative!! But how can we measure it? We should think of a way to measure creativity because it's having a bigger and bigger effect on our lives all the time. But we have not still succeeded in finding a good way. Gestalt theory gives us a better idea of what being creative means. For example it means that you can improve things or 'think out of the box' or be very open-minded and curious about things, etc. In a nutshell, creative people are able to use skills to fill in the gaps.​</h2><br />
