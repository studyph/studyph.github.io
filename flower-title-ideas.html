Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.

What means that noise, that bustle we hear?
Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.
3
There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!

My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.

With the music of drums and gongs.

There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!

This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.

Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.

I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.

The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!

My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.

I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.
