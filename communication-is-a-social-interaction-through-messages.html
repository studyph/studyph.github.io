                                            ACTIVITY 2. READ AND LEARN LESSON FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNICATION Communication plays an important role in your life. It serves many functions in order to help you share thoughts and ideas with individuals and with groups of people. Basically, the functions of communication are as follows: control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. 1. Every communication situation bears any of the following functions discussed below. Communication functions as a form of CONTROL. Communication helps regulate actions and behavior. A traffic enforcer calling your attention whenever you, as a pedestrian or a driver, violate traffic rules, is an example of this function. This function may likely happen whenever your parents at home or your teachers at school impose rules and regulations to follow and abide to. If you happen to violate these rules and regulations, a corresponding punishment may be given to you in order to establish the value of discipline on your part. 2. Communication functions to allow SOCIAL INTERACTION. Communication is meant for sharing and conveying messages, expressions and information. There is no better way to share your thoughts and ideas but through social interaction. This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</a>

                                            2. Communication is social interaction through messages.Think of someone telling, "It is very warm today." In this case, we arecommunicating what we experience'. The weather being warm is what we feel orexperience physically. In this scenario, we are sharing our feeling or experience withsomeone else. Thus, we may say that "communication is a sharing of experience." Inour society, we all interact with messages. Without interactions, a society cannotsurvive. Social interaction is always through messages.​</a>

                            23. ACTIVITY 2. READ AND LEARN LESSON FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNICATION Communication plays an important role in your life. It serves many functions in order to help you share thoughts and ideas with individuals and with groups of people. Basically, the functions of communication are as follows: control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. 1. Every communication situation bears any of the following functions discussed below. Communication functions as a form of CONTROL. Communication helps regulate actions and behavior. A traffic enforcer calling your attention whenever you, as a pedestrian or a driver, violate traffic rules, is an example of this function. This function may likely happen whenever your parents at home or your teachers at school impose rules and regulations to follow and abide to. If you happen to violate these rules and regulations, a corresponding punishment may be given to you in order to establish the value of discipline on your part. 2. Communication functions to allow SOCIAL INTERACTION. Communication is meant for sharing and conveying messages, expressions and information. There is no better way to share your thoughts and ideas but through social interaction. This function is always present whenever you talk with your family members at home; whenever you excitedly gush about your common interests with friends; whenever you discuss about lessons with your teachers and classmates at school; and whenever you find yourself in small conversations with acquaintances or even strangers.​</h2><br />

                            29. 2. Communication is social interaction through messages.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The study of social interaction involves the careful assessment of the practices of everyday communicating between people in various (usually) real-life contexts, such as doctor-patient visits, organizations, and human-computer communication.</p><p>Communication is one of those human activities that everyone recognizes but few can define satisfactorily. Communication is talking to one another, it is television, it is spreading information, it is our hair style, it is literary criticism: the list is endless. This is one of the problems facing academics: can we properly apply the term 'a subject of study' to something as diverse and multi-faceted as human communication actually is? Is there any hope of linking the study of, say, facial expression with literary criticism? Is it even an exercise worth attempting?
</p><p>The doubts that lie behind questions like these may give rise to the view that communication is not a subject, in the normal academic sense of the word, but is a multi-disciplinary area of study. This view would propose that what the psychologists and sociologists have to tell us about human communicative behaviour has very little to do with what the literary critic has.
