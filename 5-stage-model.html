C. Shannon-Weaver Model</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Further explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Linear communication model</strong> is a very simple communication model and describes communication takes place in one direction. Message flow is described as direct from the sender of the message to the recipient of the message. In the linear communication model there is no concept of feedback and the recipient of the message is passive in receiving the message. <strong>Communication models that refer to linear communication models include Aristotle's communication model, Lasswell's communication model, Berlo's SMCR communication model, and Shannon and Weaver's communication model.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>9.
