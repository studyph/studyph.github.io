                                            Philippine economy was badly hurt by the pandemic Covid-19. Entrepreneurs were forced to close down temporarily their businesses to control the spreading of the virus. As a result, ordinary people lose their sources of income and purchasing power. In order to ease the current situation, the Congress enacted in a special session and grants the President additional powers to manage the crisis. This is Republic Act No. 11469 known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.” The law gives the President the authority to divert and use the P275 billion or 62% of the approved P438 billion budget for 2020. As an economist, can the decision to use the 62% of the approved budget solve the problem? ​</a>

                                            # 1 The Philippine tarsier, (Tarsius syrichta or Carlito syrichta) is one of the smallest kinds of primates or monkeys. It lives on trees and can be found in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Mindanao in the Philippines. The locals call the tarsier “mamags” or “malmags”.  The tarsier is slowly getting endangered. Although the government has banned the hunting and selling of tarsiers to tourists, they are still in danger due to deforestation and illegal logging. Luckily, the government is now doing ways to preserve tarsiers. The Philippine Tarsier Foundation in Bohol is one place where people can visit tarsiers in their normal habitat.   Source # 2  The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) or the monkey-eating eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds in the whole world. It is a native of the Philippines and can only be found in the forests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the Philippine eagle is considered an endangered species, with only 400 pairs alive in the wild. They are the victims of shooting and hunting; they are also dying because of deforestation. The Philippine government already have several laws that provide protection to the Philippine eagle.   Source # 3  The Tamaraw, known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis is an animal endemic or native to Mindoro, a province located in Region IVA of Luzon.  It belongs to the family of buffalos, like the carabao which is more common. People used to call Mindoro the “Land of Tamaraws” but sadly, that was a long time ago. In the 1990s, around 10, 000 tamaraws were roaming in the province. This number decreased to 369 during the 1980s and in the present time, only around 20 tamaraws are said to exist in Mindoro. The tamaraws are indeed in great danger of getting extinct.   My synthesis: __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                            9. Philippine economy was badly hurt by the pandemic Covid-19. Entrepreneurs were forced to close down temporarily their businesses to control the spreading of the virus. As a result, ordinary people lose their sources of income and purchasing power. In order to ease the current situation, the Congress enacted in a special session and grants the President additional powers to manage the crisis. This is Republic Act No. 11469 known as “Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.” The law gives the President the authority to divert and use the P275 billion or 62% of the approved P438 billion budget for 2020. As an economist, can the decision to use the 62% of the approved budget solve the problem? ​</h2><br />

" Legislative power is given to a bicameral body, the Philippine Congress, which consists of two chambers - the Senate House (upper chamber) and the House of Representatives flower room). The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>1. Three Generations of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights have been categorized into three generations based on the time period and the focus of the rights.</p><p></p><p>First Generation: Civil and Political Rights</p><p>The first generation of human rights includes civil and political rights, which were first recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>Second Generation: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</p><p>The second generation of human rights emerged in the mid-20th century and focused on economic, social, and cultural rights. These rights include the right to education, work, social security, healthcare, and a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and their family.</p><p></p><p>Third Generation: Collective Rights</p><p>The third generation of human rights arose in the latter half of the 20th century and focuses on collective rights. These include the right to peace, a clean and healthy environment, and the right to self-determination of peoples and their cultures.</p><p></p><p>2. Sources of Human Rights Law in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution and laws are the primary sources of human rights law in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution specifically enumerates the civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights of all Filipino citizens. The Bill of Rights, in particular, outlines the fundamental rights of individuals and imposes limitations on the power of the state to ensure the protection of these rights.</p><p></p><p>International law is also a source of human rights law in the Philippines. The Philippines has ratified several international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. These treaties have become part of Philippine law and are recognized as sources of human rights law.</p><p></p><p>3. Personal Opinion on Human Rights Issues in our Country</p><p></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, I can provide a general statement on human rights issues in the Philippines. Despite the existence of laws and treaties protecting human rights, violations of these rights still occur in the Philippines. Human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture continue to be reported. There is a need for the government to uphold its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and for individuals to be aware of their rights and actively advocate for them.</p><br />

                        <strong>CYBERCRIME LAW</strong><p>On September 12, 2012, <strong>Republic Act No. 10175</strong>, sometimes referred to as the "<strong>Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012,</strong>" was enacted by the Philippine Congress. This law targets all forms of cybercrime performed against and through computer systems. Rules for international collaboration as well as substantive penal regulations are included.</p><p></p><p><strong>FIRST PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Everyone assumes that cybercrime exclusively refers to the theft of private information. However, in terms of definition, we can state that "Cyber Crime refers to the use of an <strong>electronic device (computer, laptop, etc.) for stealing someone's data</strong> or attempting to harm them via a computer. Additionally, it is an illegal activity that entails a number of problems, including theft and the use of your machine or IP address as a weapon for criminal action.</p><p></p><p><strong>SECOND PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Speaking generally, we may say that there are four main categories of cybercrime. These include c<strong>yber terrorism, hacking, financial, and privacy issues.</strong> They steal money from users or account holders in financial crimes. They also took data from businesses, which might result in financial crimes. Due to them, transactions are also highly risky. Millions and billions of rupees are stolen annually by hackers from businesspeople and the government.</p><p></p><p><strong>THIRD PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Stealing your private information that you do not want made public is considered a privacy offense. Additionally, because of the <strong>exploitation of personal data,</strong> people suffer greatly as a result, and some even end their lives. In order to harm the public or the website owner, hackers willfully deface websites. In addition, they alter or destroy the value of the already-existing websites.</p><p></p><p><strong>FOURTH PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>Compared to few years ago, modern-day terrorism has significantly increased. Cyber terrorism, however, is not merely a problem for <strong>terrorists or terrorist groups</strong>. However, it is also considered a kind of cyber terrorism to seriously threaten someone or their property.</p><p>We are not powerless to combat cybercrime on our own. Similarly, we may prevent cybercrimes from occurring by using a little common sense and reasoning.</p><p></p><p><strong>FIFTH PARAGRAPH</strong></p><p>As a conclusion, we may state that <strong>cybercrime is a serious offense </strong>against anyone's privacy or property. Additionally, we can prevent cybercrime by adhering to certain fundamental logic and utilizing common sense. Above all, cybercrime is against both the law and human rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about cybercrime law: </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22950998?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>pa brainliest, 5 star and hearth po :)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, I can provide general information and arguments that are often presented by different groups or individuals in favor or against these issues. Here are some common reasons that are often presented in debates or discussions:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Same-Sex Marriage:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>Marriage equality is a basic human right and should be extended to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</strong></p><p><strong>Same-sex couples should have the same legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples, including the right to marry, adopt children, and access health care benefits.</strong></p><p><strong>Same-sex marriage can strengthen families and promote social acceptance of diversity and inclusion.</strong></p><p><strong>Against:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman, and allowing same-sex marriage would undermine traditional values and religious beliefs.</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing same-sex marriage could lead to social and moral degradation, and harm the well-being of children raised in same-sex households.</strong></p><p><strong>Same-sex marriage is not necessary, as same-sex couples can already enjoy legal protections and benefits through civil unions or domestic partnerships.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Implementation of Reproductive Health Law:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law promotes access to family planning services, education, and information, which can improve maternal and child health outcomes, reduce poverty, and empower women.</strong></p><p><strong>Reproductive health is a fundamental human right, and individuals should have the freedom to make informed choices about their own reproductive health.</strong></p><p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law can help address the population growth and demographic challenges facing the country.</strong></p><p><strong>Against:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law promotes immoral and anti-life practices, such as contraception and abortion, which go against traditional and religious values.</strong></p><p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law is a violation of the right to life and the protection of the unborn.</strong></p><p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law imposes a burden on taxpayers and the government, and may lead to the promotion of irresponsible behavior and sexual promiscuity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Legalization of Divorce in the Philippines:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce would provide individuals in abusive, dysfunctional, or irreconcilable marriages with a legal remedy to end their suffering and start anew.</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce would promote gender equality and empower women who are trapped in unhappy or violent marriages.</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce would bring the Philippines in line with other countries that recognize the right to divorce, and reduce the social stigma and discrimination against divorced individuals.</strong></p><p><strong>Against:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce would undermine the sanctity of marriage and traditional family values, and encourage a culture of divorce and infidelity.</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce would lead to the breakdown of families, harm the well-being of children, and increase social and economic costs.</strong></p><p><strong>Legalizing divorce is unnecessary, as there are already legal remedies available, such as annulment, legal separation, and psychological incapacity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Death Penalty Implementation:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>The death penalty serves as a deterrent to crime and can reduce the</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>SOGIE Bill/Anti-Discrimination Bill:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill can protect the rights and dignity of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ and provide them with legal remedies for discrimination, harassment, and violence.</strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill can promote inclusivity and diversity in society, and create a more accepting and tolerant environment for all.</strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill can align the Philippines with international human rights standards and obligations.</strong></p><p><strong>Against:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill promotes immoral and un-Christian behavior and undermines traditional values and gender norms.</strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill can lead to confusion and conflict, especially in schools and public restrooms, and infringe on the privacy and safety of others.</strong></p><p><strong>The SOGIE bill is unnecessary, as existing laws already protect against discrimination based on age, sex, race, religion, and disability.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Face to Face Classes or Online Distance Learning:</strong></p><p><strong>In favor:</strong></p><p><strong>Face-to-face classes provide a more interactive, engaging, and personalized learning experience, and can enhance social skills and peer relationships.</strong></p><p><strong>Face-to-face classes can reduce the burden on parents and caregivers who may not have the time, resources, or skills to facilitate online learning.</strong></p><p><strong>Face-to-face classes can promote equity and accessibility, especially for students who

                            29. # 1 The Philippine tarsier, (Tarsius syrichta or Carlito syrichta) is one of the smallest kinds of primates or monkeys. It lives on trees and can be found in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Mindanao in the Philippines. The locals call the tarsier “mamags” or “malmags”.  The tarsier is slowly getting endangered. Although the government has banned the hunting and selling of tarsiers to tourists, they are still in danger due to deforestation and illegal logging. Luckily, the government is now doing ways to preserve tarsiers. The Philippine Tarsier Foundation in Bohol is one place where people can visit tarsiers in their normal habitat.   Source # 2  The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) or the monkey-eating eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds in the whole world. It is a native of the Philippines and can only be found in the forests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the Philippine eagle is considered an endangered species, with only 400 pairs alive in the wild. They are the victims of shooting and hunting; they are also dying because of deforestation. The Philippine government already have several laws that provide protection to the Philippine eagle.   Source # 3  The Tamaraw, known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis is an animal endemic or native to Mindoro, a province located in Region IVA of Luzon.  It belongs to the family of buffalos, like the carabao which is more common. People used to call Mindoro the “Land of Tamaraws” but sadly, that was a long time ago. In the 1990s, around 10, 000 tamaraws were roaming in the province. This number decreased to 369 during the 1980s and in the present time, only around 20 tamaraws are said to exist in Mindoro. The tamaraws are indeed in great danger of getting extinct.   My synthesis: __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
