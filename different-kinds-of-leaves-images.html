We could not resist gobbling a few berries as we picked, because the hunters had not had a succesful day out yesterday,and we had only had a baby deer to share between our large families of twenty four so we were so ravenously hungry.Note:tipi-less common spelling TEPEEComprehension questions:1.

DIARY OF A STONE AGE CHILD Dear Diary, Today was the most incredible day of my life. Shall I tell you what I did? I woke feeling cold and looked up to see my younger brother, Stoat, leaving. The fire had gone out and the deer skin that my mother, Fennel, had draped carefully over me last night had fallen off, so may bare feet could feel the autumn breeze blowing in. It was time to get up. Emerging from the tipi, I looked out at the hills beyond our camp to see the sun slowly rising. I had jobs to do that morning but first I had to help my brother to gather some breakfast. We took our rabbit skin back to the edge of the wood where the blackberries grew and filled them up to the brim. We could not resist gobbling a few berries as we picked, because the hunters had not had a successful day out yesterday, and we had only had a baby deer to share between our large families of twenty four so we were so ravenously hungry.
