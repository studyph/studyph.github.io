                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.  Globalization has had a significant impact on religious practices and beliefs. The spread of technology, transportation, and communication networks has made it easier for religions to spread beyond their traditional borders, resulting in a more diverse and interconnected religious landscape. This has led to increased awareness and understanding of different religious beliefs and practices. For example, the spread of Buddhism from its traditional base in Asia to other parts of the world is a clear indication of globalization's impact on religious practices.</p><p></p><p>2.  Various media platforms, such as social media, television, and online streaming, have contributed significantly to the globalization of religious congregations. For instance, some religious congregations use these platforms to broadcast their sermons and teachings, reach a broader audience, and interact with their followers. One example is the Lakewood Church, a megachurch in Houston, Texas, which uses various media platforms, including television and social media, to reach millions of people globally.</p><p></p><p>3.  The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in most democratic societies. This separation ensures that the government does not endorse or favor any particular religion, and all individuals are free to practice their chosen faith without fear of persecution or discrimination. However, the interpretation and implementation of this principle are often controversial, and different groups have varying opinions on how it should be applied. Nonetheless, the separation of church and state remains a vital aspect of democratic governance and religious freedom.</p><br />
