Slopes facing the sun are warmer than those that are not6. In the southern hemisphere, the current flows incounterclockwise direction7. At night, soil cools down faster than water, so the airtemperature above ground is lower than the above sea.8. Places that are far from the bodies of water have extremeClimates.9.

Derived from the Spanish term which

Derived its name from the Spanish term
which represents ‘little girl’
the warming phase of the El
Niño Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)
sea surface temperature
decreases of more than 0.9°
Fahrenheit for at least five
successive three-month seasons
westward-blowing trade winds weaken
along the Equator
eastward-blowing trade winds
strengthen along the Equator
It is laden with high air surface
pressure in the western Pacific.
Enhanced upwelling of nutrient-rich
water leading to more fish
Reduced upwelling of
nutrient-rich water leading to
less fish
It contains low air surface
pressure in the eastern Pacific
It is warmer than normal sea-surface
temperatures. It is a warming of the
Pacific Ocean between South America
and the International Date Line, centered
directly on the Equator, and moves
towards several degrees of latitude to
either side of the equator.
Winters are wetter and cause
above-average precipitation
across the Northwest of the
pacific and drier and below
average precipitation in
Southwest of the Pacific.
It has a great impact on the
season pattern because it makes
warmer and drier than average
in the Northwest of the Pacific
during winters and wetter in the
Southwest of the Pacific and
experiences reduced snowfalls.
It is cooler than normal sea-surface
temperatures. It originated when cooler
than usual ocean temperatures occur on
the equator between South America and
the International Date Line.
the warm pool of water moves
eastward, and the slope of the
thermocline flattens
the warm pool moves westward,
and the slope of the thermocline
steepens</a>

                        <p><strong>Continental slope – The slope is “the deepening sea floor out from the shelf edge to the upper limit of the continental rise, or the point where there is a general decrease in steepness” (IHO, 2008).  Compared with the relatively flat surface and gentle inclination of the continental shelf, the continental slope dips steeply into the ocean basins at an average angle of around 4° although it may be much steeper locally (35 to 90°).  The continental slope (often referred to simply as “the slope”) is commonly dissected by submarine canyons; faulting, rifting and slumping of large blocks of sediment can form steep escarpments, relatively flat terraces and (under certain conditions) basins perched on the slope.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hope</strong><strong> </strong><strong>this</strong><strong> </strong><strong>helped</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p><strong>#AnswersForTrees</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>–</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Arrietty</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Derived from the Spanish term which
represents “little boy”
the cooling phase of the El
Niño-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)

successive three-month seasons
Derived its name from the Spanish term
which represents ‘little girl’
the warming phase of the El
Niño Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)
sea surface temperature
decreases of more than 0.9°
Fahrenheit for at least five
successive three-month seasons
westward-blowing trade winds weaken
along the Equator
eastward-blowing trade winds
strengthen along the Equator
It is laden with high air surface
pressure in the western Pacific.
Enhanced upwelling of nutrient-rich
water leading to more fish
Reduced upwelling of
nutrient-rich water leading to
less fish
It contains low air surface
pressure in the eastern Pacific
It is warmer than normal sea-surface
temperatures. It is a warming of the
Pacific Ocean between South America
and the International Date Line, centered
directly on the Equator, and moves
towards several degrees of latitude to
either side of the equator.
Winters are wetter and cause
above-average precipitation
across the Northwest of the
pacific and drier and below
average precipitation in
Southwest of the Pacific.
It has a great impact on the
season pattern because it makes
warmer and drier than average
in the Northwest of the Pacific
during winters and wetter in the
Southwest of the Pacific and
experiences reduced snowfalls.
It is cooler than normal sea-surface
temperatures. It originated when cooler
than usual ocean temperatures occur on
the equator between South America and
the International Date Line.
the warm pool of water moves
eastward, and the slope of the
thermocline flattens
the warm pool moves westward,
and the slope of the thermocline
steepens</h2><br />
