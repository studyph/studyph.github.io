The researcher must be competent and careful in composing the essential elements of the research paper2. A research title must be effective, concise, and limited only to substantive words with high consideration to the key variables.3. While considering the external and internal criteria, being familiar with potential sources like theory, practitioner, personalexperience, and relevant literature may also help the researcher to come up with a good research problem4. In writing the rationale of the study, the researcher must provide the readers with critical background or contextualinformation that introduces the research topic along with why the proposed study actually matters.5. The statement of the problem contains a general topic and specific problems.6. In writing the research problem, the researcher needs to include both researchable and non-researchable questions at alltimes7. Research locale and specific duration must not be included in defining the scope of the study8. Researchers need to follow a step-by-step procedure in conducting any study9. In writing the scope and delimitation of the study, the researcher must be able to present the valuable contribution of thestudy to a particular body of knowledge or area of specialization10 Benefits that can be gained from the study are classified as academic and non-academic​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Scope and delimitations are two elements of a research paper or thesis. The scope of a study explains the extent to which the research area will be explored in the work and specifies the parameters within which the study will be operating. For example, let's say a researcher wants to study the impact of mobile phones on behavior patterns of elementary school children. However, it is not possible for the researcher to cover every aspect of the topic.</p><p>So the scope will have to be narrowed down to a certain section of the target population. In this case, the scope might be narrowed down to a group of 50 children in grades 3-5 of one specific school. Their behavior patterns in school may have been observed for a duration of 6 months. These would form the delimitations of the study.</p><p>Thus, delimitations are the characteristics that limit the scope and describe the boundaries of the study, such as the sample size, geographical location or setting in which the study takes place, population traits, etc. Additionally, the researcher might also choose to use some research tools and methodologies to collect data but not others. These delimitations might be imposed for practical reasons, such as lack of time or financial resources to carry out a more thorough investigation. The delimitation section of the study should explain why specific choices were made while others were excluded and how this might affect the outcome of the research.</p><p>In the example mentioned above, the researcher might state why he/she chose to study a sample population of 50 students, why he/she selected students from Grades 3-5 and not grades 1-2, and why he/she chose students of Billabong Elementary Public School over other schools.</p><p>To learn in depth how to write a persuasive Introduction for your research paper, check out this course designed exclusively for researchers: How to write a strong introduction for your research paper.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlies po please po </p><p></p><br />
