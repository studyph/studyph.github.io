                                            Number the sentences in the correct order of events during Marcos’ Presidency.
_____1. On September 21, 1972, Marcos imposed martial law on the Philippines. Holding that
communist and subversive forces had precipitated the crisis, he acted swiftly;
opposition politicians were jailed, and the armed forces became an arm of the
regime.
_____2. To reassert his mandate, Marcos called for presidential elections to be held in 1986.
But a formidable political opponent soon emerged in Aquino’s widow, Corazon
Aquino, who became the presidential candidate of the opposition. It was widely
asserted that Marcos managed to defeat Aquino and retain the presidency in the
election of February 7, 1986, only through massive voting fraud on the part of his
supporters.
_____3. Marcos ran as the Nationalist Party candidate for president against the Liberal
president, Diosdado Macapagal.
PHILIPPINE POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE 7
_____4. Under martial law the president assumed extraordinary powers, including the ability
to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.
_____5. Marcos won and was inaugurated as president on December 30, 1965.
_____6. In desire to fight against Marcos and the increasingly powerful New People’s Army
Benigno Aquino, Jr., returned to Manila on August 21, 1983, only to be shot dead as
he stepped off the airplane.
_____7. A tense standoff that ensued between the two sides (Marcos’ supporters and
Aquinos’) ended only when Marcos fled the country on February 25, 1986, at U.S.
urging. He went into exile in Hawaii, where he remained until his death.
_____8. In 1969 he was re-elected, becoming the first Philippine president to serve a second
term.
_____9. After Marcos’ death, Imelda was acquitted of all charges by a federal court. She was
allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991, and in 1993 a Philippine court found her
guilty of corruption (the conviction was overturned in 1998).
_____10. An independent commission appointed by Marcos concluded in 1984 that high
military officers were responsible for Aquino’s assassination.</a>

election of February 7, 1986, only through massive voting fraud on the part of his
supporters.
_____3. Marcos ran as the Nationalist Party candidate for president against the Liberal
president, Diosdado Macapagal.

he stepped off the airplane.

Aquinos’) ended only when Marcos fled the country on February 25, 1986, at U.S.
urging. He went into exile in Hawaii, where he remained until his death.
_____8. In 1969 he was re-elected, becoming the first Philippine president to serve a second
term.
_____9. After Marcos’ death, Imelda was acquitted of all charges by a federal court. She was
allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991, and in 1993 a Philippine court found her
guilty of corruption (the conviction was overturned in 1998).
