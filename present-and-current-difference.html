spreading theory? Explain how they differ.
Hint question:
What do the continental drift theory and the seafloor spreading theory say
about the oceans/seafloor?
2) How does the concept of convection current support seafloor-spreading
theory?
Hint question:
Which important material mentioned in seafloor spreading theory is also
present in convection currents?
3) Elaborate how the interior structure of the Earth implicitly explains the
existence of convection currents.
Hint:
What does temperature have to do with convection currents?</a>

What are the different ocean currents that carry cold water? Give at least three Examples: 4. How does occan current affects climate? Now, you have learned that distance from the ocean sea is another factor that affects climate The amount of water vapor present in the air of our surroundings is known as humidity increases as the temperature also increases. And since water vapor produced through heat from the sun, we will be expecting that water vapor is having high temperature. And if this vapor stays in in the surroundings it will make us uncomfortable and warm. It's time for you to explore more factors that influence climate​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Electrical potential difference is also called voltage.

                        <p><strong>COVID-19 AND BIOLOGY AS THE SOLUTION</strong></p><p></p><p>To limit the spread of <strong>COVID-19</strong>, doctors advise isolating infected patients and encouraging regular hand washing and mask use. In the wake of the<strong> COVID-19 epidemic</strong>, governments are going for statewide <strong>lockdown</strong> as<strong> the only preventive</strong> measure to avert community propagation of this disease, affecting the general population economically, socially, and psychologically. This review covers the evolution of human coronaviruses, treatment and control options for <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and its impact on <strong>human life</strong>.</p><p>In the past months, the transmission of <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>, the cause of <strong>COVID-19</strong>, has become a global concern. It began in Wuhan, China, and is thought to have spread through Rhinolophus bats. There is no clinically validated vaccine for<strong> SARS-CoV-2</strong>. Thus doctors are using different strategies that have worked for other human coronaviruses. </p><p>Several <strong>antiviral medicines</strong> are being tested for their efficacy and safety against the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. Several<strong> therapeutic</strong> and <strong>preventive </strong>treatments are recommended for<strong> SARS-CoV-2 patients</strong>. Double-stranded RNAs can decrease viral genome expression through RNA interference, an endogenous<strong> biological mechanism</strong>. RNA interference can be utilized to treat HIV and hepatitis, according to genomic studies.</p><p>Treatments standard Complete isolation of the infected patient with an N95 or FFP3 mask, sterilized gown, and <strong>regular monitoring</strong> of body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, pulse, sputum screening, respiration rate, and other apparent symptoms are standard COVID-19 control techniques. The following subsections cover additional therapeutic and prophylactic <strong>SARS-CoV-2 therapy options</strong>.</p><p><strong>Virology Interferon-</strong> (IFN-) is effective against COVID-19 in many circumstances. IFN- stimulates innate and adaptive immune responses in infected patients, preventing SARS-CoV replication. Infected cynomolgus monkeys responded well to IFN-. In a pilot treatment trial, synthetic recombinant IFN- healed SARS patients. If IFN- studies are successful, it will be suggested for COVID-19 patients.</p><p><strong>Lopinavir and ritonavir</strong>, protease inhibitors, can impede HIV reproduction by producing antibodies. Ritonavir and lopinavir can inhibit COVID-19 protein synthesis by binding the <strong>SARS-CoV-2 protease</strong>. To use this medicine to combat COVID-19, more study is needed.</p><p></p><p>Above are examples of <strong>the Biology</strong> that can be used for this COVID-19 problem, and I'll attach <strong>the example of a presentation</strong> too about WHO (WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION) suggestions about the virus.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the presentation here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5547381</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ6</strong></p><br />

Present Value measures the current value of an amount of money or a stream of cash flows that is expected in the future. 2. Present value is important because it will not give hint investors to compare values over time. 3. Present value is the comparable value today of cash sometime in the future. 4. Future value is the value of a current asset in the future date based on an assumed rate of growth. 5. Future Value calculation allows investors to predict with varying degrees of accuracy the amount of profit that car be generated by different investments.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The curriculum content is of social relevance when the learning experiences are related to the disciplines (subjects) taught in schools. ... When learners are educated on this aspect they tend to be change in behavior in human beings; therefore, the curriculum should bring about change in behavior, attitude and value.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Problem-solving, creative thinking, digital skills and collaboration are in greater need every year yet are not taught in our schools. ... To prepare all students with the creative, collaborative and digital problem-solving skills of the future, schools must teach computer science as part of the core curriculum.</p><br />

                            24. Questions:
1) What aspect of the continental drift theory is opposed by the seafloor
spreading theory? Explain how they differ.
Hint question:
What do the continental drift theory and the seafloor spreading theory say
about the oceans/seafloor?
2) How does the concept of convection current support seafloor-spreading
theory?
Hint question:
Which important material mentioned in seafloor spreading theory is also
present in convection currents?
3) Elaborate how the interior structure of the Earth implicitly explains the
existence of convection currents.
Hint:
What does temperature have to do with convection currents?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.) Similar to Wegener's theory that continents do in fact move, Hess' seafloor spreading contradicted Wegener's continental drift in that it involved the ocean sea floor moving as it expanded—instead of continents ploughing through the sea.</p><p></p><p>2.) Convection currents also “recycle” lithospheric materials back to the mantle. Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent plate boundaries. As tectonic plates slowly move away from each other, heat from the mantle's convection currents makes the crust more plastic and less dense.</p><p></p><p>3.) </p><br />

What are the different ocean currents that carry cold water? Give at least three Examples: 4. How does occan current affects climate? Now, you have learned that distance from the ocean sea is another factor that affects climate The amount of water vapor present in the air of our surroundings is known as humidity increases as the temperature also increases. And since water vapor produced through heat from the sun, we will be expecting that water vapor is having high temperature. And if this vapor stays in in the surroundings it will make us uncomfortable and warm. It's time for you to explore more factors that influence climate​</h2><br />
