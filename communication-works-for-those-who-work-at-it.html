                            20. "Communication work for those who work at it" by john powell what is your 3 insights about the quotation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Three insights from the quotation "Communication works for those who work on it" by John Powell.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Communication is not just talking.</strong></p><p>The first insight is that communication is not just an activity where two or more people talk to each other. More than that, communication is an effort made by people to convey or give information or messages to others. Therefore, there are aspects that we must pay attention to ensure that communication can run efficiently and effectively so that messages or information can be conveyed and received properly.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Focus is one of the most important things when communicating</strong></p><p>The second insight is that we must focus when communicating. Both parties who communicate must pay attention to each other and their efforts so that communication can occur effectively and efficiently. If only one of the parties focuses on communicating, it is very likely that messages and information are not conveyed properly.</p><p>For example, when a mother tells her child to turn off the stove after fifteen minutes but the child is listening while playing games or on a cellphone, there is a possibility that the child will forget and not carry out his mother's message.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Communication must be two-way.</strong></p><p>The third insight is that communication must be two-way. This means that when communicating, the people involved must give their efforts to achieve the goal of communication, not just one person. For example, when two friends are in conflict, they both have to make an effort to communicate well to resolve the conflict. Because if only one person tries, then the purpose of communication will not succeed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about communication</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2796727</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Social work tends to focus on people whose circumstances have put them at a disadvantage to others in society as a whole. Therefore it’s probably true to say that technically social work does not improve society but tries to restore it to a normal conditionTo protect themselves and also given proper educationSocial workers must communicate with clients to gain information, thereby causing detrimental effects to clientsYes, because social work is all about listening to people's needs, not assuming their needs. This simple skill makes a lot of people's lives easier because we live in a world where everyone wants control and is always talkingMany social workers work for state and local government agencies to provide social services to their local community. A few examples include child welfare social workers, school social workers, and probation officers. These professionals may also work in healthcare settings like clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Consecrated life is a state of life in the Catholic Church lived by those faithful who are called to follow Jesus Christ in a more exacting way. ... They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious families.</p><p></p><p>2. When something is consecrated it is declared to be sacred or holy. Many Catholics, for example, believe that bread and wine are consecrated, or made sacred during Holy Communion, becoming the body and blood of Christ. ... It's not just bread and wine that people believe to be consecrated</p><p></p><p>3. What are the evangelical counsels, and how are they a significant aspect of consecrated life? The Evangelical counsels are vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. They are meant to imitate the poverty Christ experienced to become closer to Him. Describe the role of consecrated life within a Church.</p><p></p><p>4. In the Christian tradition the eremitic life is an early form of monastic living that preceded the monastic life in the cenobium. ...
