                        <p> </p><p>1) An activity can be legal but not ethical. Ethics do not have a specific definition, it depends on a persons knowledge on things's right or wrong. ... It can be effective by how an person is educated.</p><p></p><p>2)  I would prefer to be known as more of a person with modest means and impeccable ethical character rather than an unscrupulous person of wealth. ... Someone who places a greater value on ethics will form bonds with everyone they do business with by having a higher level of trust, improved morale, and greater loyalty.</p><p> </p><p>3) In some cases, the breaching party could be ordered to correct the breach that occurred, so his performance matches contractual terms. If a material breach happened, the non-breaching party could be absolved of responsibility to perform his/her or its part of the contract.</p><p></p><p>4)  ● First is managing our store. sometimes i manage our store when i have a free time or if i don not have class.many customers who are very slow in pointing their needs and they always wanted me to wait and there are customers also like they are in a hurried always and sometimes I got annoyed, irritated, and angry. So I learned I got to be patience and I have to relax because if you have to hold a particular business, you just have a good communication to your costumers and every business holders should have virtue.</p><p></p><p>●Second is conducting training in different schools. one of the instructors of Leadership Development Training(LDP) picked me as one of the facilitators of the training.

                            28. 1. Which door would you enter? Why? 2. Why do you think God created two different genders - a "he" and a "she"? 3. What is your feeling if a boy enters through a "she" door and a girl enters through a "he" door? Why would you feel that way? 4. In your list, are there characteristics that maybe shared by both a "he" and a "she" person? What are those? 5. Which characteristics that should not be shared? Which characteristics are for the boys only or for the girls only? 6. What is the basic difference between a "He" and a "She" person? Is it in behavior? Way of thinking? Interests? Roles and Responsibilities?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(the answer if your school is not homophobic)</p><p></p><p>1. I would enter the door that identifies with my gender identity because that is who i am.</p><p></p><p>2. God did not only create two genders as each one of us are design by God and we are meant to be this way. It is on God's plan that we may identify a different gender from a "he" and a "she" or identify as the opposite.</p><p></p><p>3. I would not mind because that is the door that was meant for them if they identify as the opposite gender. It would only be a problem if they start harassing other people the same as if the other gender starts to harass people too.</p><p></p><p>4. I believe that everyone have their own femenine and masculine traits and would not be considered as a "he" or a "she". They can do whatever they want regardless of their gender.</p><p></p><p>5. All characteristics can be shared with either gender. This won't define who they are and they are free to do whatever they want. Gender as well is a social construct and one's masculinity and femininity doesn't define who they are, only they can define it.</p><p></p><p>6. There aren't really any difference between them and "he" and "she" are pronouns. Any person with any gender identity can do anything what they want and identify as what they trully are.</p><br />
