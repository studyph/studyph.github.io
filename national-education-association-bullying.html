Parents and teachers can help children understand what bullying is and explain to the children that bullying is bad while the teachers too should get involved directly and educate children on the harmful effects that might bullying can cause to someone.</a>

                                            Experiences of Cyber bullying 
The teachers were not aware of the extent of cyber bullying 
Another common theme was that the teachers did not seem to know the 
extent of cyber bullying. The students did not think that the teachers had enough 
knowledge about the issue and that they are from a generation that has not 
experienced this kind of dilemmas and situations that internet can cause. The 
students argued that the teachers need education in the subject of cyber bullying in 
order to get an understanding about it. 
“The teachers are from another generation; they do not know how affected 
the victim becomes.” (Student C1)
“The teachers should be educated about cyber bullying in order to tackle it.” 
(Student A4)
“There is a new generation that are growing up in this technological 
environment, teachers need to learn and be educated in order to understand this 
generation. Cyber bullying is something new teachers and other adults needs to get 
information about.” (Student C4)
“Teachers do not understand much about cyber bullying and how much 
harm it can cause, they should be educated.” (Student C2) 
Based on the comments from the interviewed students, this issue of teachers 
being unaware of the extent of cyber bullying among students, could be connected 
to age. According to Berger and Luckmann (1966 in Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2009) 
experiences and knowledge are stored in memory of individuals and between 
individuals. The teachers who are grown up in a time where technologies were not 
as developed as today might have difficulties with relating to this issue of cyber 
7 bullying because they have no memories or experiences of cyber bullying and 
therefore they cannot understand it fully. Reality is constructed differently due to 
age. (Kakai, 2016)

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Education:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Education is crucial in preparing individuals for their future and giving them the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their personal and professional lives. It opens up opportunities and empowers people to make informed decisions and contribute positively to society.</p><p>Viewpoint 2: While education is important, the traditional education system may not be the best fit for everyone. Some people may learn better through experiential or vocational learning, and there is a need for more flexibility and creativity in the education system to accommodate diverse learning styles and interests.</p><p></p><p>Bullying:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Bullying is a serious issue that can have long-lasting effects on the mental and emotional well-being of individuals. It is important to raise awareness, promote empathy and kindness, and implement strict anti-bullying policies in schools and communities to prevent and address bullying.</p><p>Viewpoint 2: While bullying is a problem, some people argue that it is a natural part of growing up and toughens individuals up for the challenges of the real world. They also believe that anti-bullying measures may go too far and stifle free speech or overprotect individuals from necessary challenges.</p><p></p><p>Vaping:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Vaping can be harmful to health and has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It is important to educate people on the risks of vaping and regulate the marketing and availability of vaping products, especially to youth.</p><p>Viewpoint 2: Some people believe that vaping is a less harmful alternative to smoking and can help individuals quit smoking. They also argue that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices and that excessive regulation can be overly paternalistic.</p><p></p><p>Garbage:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Proper waste management and reduction is crucial in protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. It is important to reduce waste at the source, promote recycling and composting, and properly dispose of hazardous waste to minimize the impact of garbage on our ecosystems.</p><p>Viewpoint 2: While waste reduction is important, some people argue that the burden should not solely be on individuals and that systemic change is necessary to address the root causes of waste production, such as overconsumption and planned obsolescence.</p><p></p><p>Earthquake:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Earthquakes are natural disasters that can cause significant damage and loss of life. It is important to have proper earthquake preparedness and response measures in place, such as earthquake drills, building codes, and emergency supplies, to minimize the impact of earthquakes on communities.</p><p>Viewpoint 2: While earthquakes are a concern, some people argue that they are a natural part of the earth's cycles and cannot be prevented. They also believe that excessive focus on earthquakes can distract from other important issues, such as climate change.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Education:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Education is the most important aspect of an individual's life as it has the power to transform lives and create a better future. Education is not just about gaining knowledge, but it is also about developing skills, values, and attitudes that help individuals become responsible citizens and contribute to the society at large.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: Although education is essential, the current education system is flawed and needs significant reforms. The focus on grades and exams leads to a stressful and competitive environment that may not be conducive to learning. Additionally, the curriculum may not be relevant or up-to-date, leading to a gap between what is taught and what is required in the real world.</p><p></p><p>2. Bullying:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Bullying is a serious issue that can have long-lasting negative effects on the victim's mental and physical health. It is crucial to raise awareness about the impact of bullying and implement preventive measures to create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: While bullying is unacceptable, some argue that it is a natural part of growing up and can help prepare individuals for the real world. Others may argue that the focus on bullying takes away from other important issues that affect students, such as mental health or academic performance.</p><p></p><p>3. Vaping:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Vaping is a harmful habit and should be discouraged, especially among young people. It can lead to addiction, respiratory issues, and other health problems. Education and awareness campaigns should be implemented to highlight the dangers of vaping and promote healthier alternatives.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: Vaping can be a safer alternative to smoking for individuals who are trying to quit. It is less harmful than traditional cigarettes and may even have some health benefits. However, it is essential to use vaping products responsibly and not to glamorize the habit.</p><p></p><p>4. Garbage:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Garbage and waste management is a significant environmental issue. The improper disposal of waste can lead to pollution, health hazards, and harm to wildlife. It is essential to reduce waste production, recycle and dispose of waste responsibly to protect the environment.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: Waste management can be expensive, and some argue that it is not a priority in terms of funding and resources. Others may argue that the focus should be on developing new technologies that can help reduce waste production and find new uses for waste materials.</p><p></p><p>5. Earthquake:</p><p>Viewpoint 1: Earthquakes are a natural disaster that can cause significant damage to property and loss of life. It is essential to be prepared for earthquakes by taking necessary precautions, such as securing furniture, having emergency supplies, and knowing evacuation routes.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: While earthquakes are unpredictable, some argue that the focus on earthquake preparedness takes away from other important issues, such as poverty or healthcare. Others may argue that earthquake preparedness should be the responsibility of individuals and not the government.</p><br />

                            29. Experiences of Cyber bullying 
The teachers were not aware of the extent of cyber bullying 
Another common theme was that the teachers did not seem to know the 
extent of cyber bullying. The students did not think that the teachers had enough 
knowledge about the issue and that they are from a generation that has not 
experienced this kind of dilemmas and situations that internet can cause. The 
students argued that the teachers need education in the subject of cyber bullying in 
order to get an understanding about it. 
“The teachers are from another generation; they do not know how affected 
the victim becomes.” (Student C1)
“The teachers should be educated about cyber bullying in order to tackle it.” 
(Student A4)
“There is a new generation that are growing up in this technological 
environment, teachers need to learn and be educated in order to understand this 
generation. Cyber bullying is something new teachers and other adults needs to get 
information about.” (Student C4)
“Teachers do not understand much about cyber bullying and how much 
harm it can cause, they should be educated.” (Student C2) 
Based on the comments from the interviewed students, this issue of teachers 
being unaware of the extent of cyber bullying among students, could be connected 
to age. According to Berger and Luckmann (1966 in Alvesson &amp; Sköldberg, 2009) 
experiences and knowledge are stored in memory of individuals and between 
individuals. The teachers who are grown up in a time where technologies were not 
as developed as today might have difficulties with relating to this issue of cyber 
7 bullying because they have no memories or experiences of cyber bullying and 
therefore they cannot understand it fully. Reality is constructed differently due to 
age. (Kakai, 2016)
