The Socratic philosophers in ancient Greece were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  Studied ethics, virtue, justice, and other ideas relating to human behavior. Following in Socrates' footsteps, he became a teacher and inspired the work of the next great Greek philosopher, Aristotle.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Business ethics refers to the moral principles that guide the operations of a company or business. Common issues that fall under this umbrella include employer-employee relations, discrimination, environmental issues, bribery, insider trading, and social responsibility.3. The poorest members of society are not necessarily the greatest beneficiaries under the Difference Principle. According to the Difference Principle, inequalities can be justified only if they make the least well-off better off than they would be under a more egalitarian arrangement.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Aristotle believed that wisdom was virtuous, but that achieving virtue was neither automatic nor did it grant any unification (acquiring) of other virtues. Vision of the virtue's source can be considered as more realistic in comparison with Socrates' one. He is the first philosopher who develops the moral principles with focusing on the voluntary aspect of personality. The knowledge has the general character, and the action is a result of the personal will.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility, the final essential virtue, can be considered the foundation of the whole moral life. Humility is necessary for the acquisition of the other virtues because it makes us aware of our imperfections and leads us to try to become a better person.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I hope this helps, i</strong><strong> </strong><strong>dont </strong><strong>know </strong><strong>if it's right, but I hope it helped you. </strong><strong>thanks!</strong></p><br />
