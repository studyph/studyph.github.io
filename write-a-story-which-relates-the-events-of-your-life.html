                        In the past, I was born just like a star, a small, insignificant thing in a vast universe. I had no idea what my future held or what kind of impact I would make.<br /><br />In the present, I have gone through a series of transformations, just like a star does in its life cycle. I have grown and changed, sometimes violently, sometimes peacefully. I have learned, loved, lost, and gained. My life has been full of both light and darkness.<br /><br />In the future, like a star nearing the end of its life, I will eventually burn out. But even then, my legacy will live on, just as a star's death gives birth to new stars and planets. The cycle will continue, and my life will have played a small but significant role in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Brainliest moto!!<br />

Socrates patiently listened to the man’s question and told him to meet him near the river the following day for the answer. So the next day, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him toward the river. As they went into the river, the water got up to their neck. But to the young man’s surprise, Socrates ducked him into the water.</p><p></p><p>The young man struggled to get out of the water, but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Finally, Socrates pulled the man’s head out of the water. The young man gasped and took a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ‘What did you want the most when your head was in the water?” The young man replied, “Air.” Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air while you were in the water, then you will get it. There is no other secret.”</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I used to be a bundle of energy, almost like a newborn star, full of light. Then I grew, and that energy was wasted as I grew. Still, I have enough energy to fantasize about having children in the future. When I have them and they grow up, they will form their own lives and become independent of me. As with the “planetary nebula,” that part of me will separate from my body. But, at the very least, I know that when I’m no longer here, I’ll have enlightened everyone around me with the love and shine that has always defined me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>sana po maka tulong ako</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Reflective essay: My past, present and future life Introduction When I was growing up, I remember my family situation as extremely chaotic. I was one of eight children and my father and mother had little time to devote to me individually. Most of the time they spent trying to earn enough to support us with their meager resources. I was often called upon to act as a surrogate mother to my siblings. I felt I had little time to develop my own unique perspective and voice when I was very young. Even as a preschooler I remember doing chores to help out at home. However, this situation did foster some positive aspects of my character. I learned to be mature at an early age and gained a sense of competence because of my responsibilities. But I also was taught put the needs of others second to my own. I feel that I did not learn to value my own, legitimate desires to an adequate degree as a young girl and have only recently acquired a true sense of worth [THESIS]. Past According to the developmental theorist Erik Erikson, every child proceeds through a series of social stages in which there is a core, essential conflict that must be addressed. If that conflict is not fully resolved, the child carries that unresolved issue into the next stage, and cannot truly mature.</strong></p><br />
