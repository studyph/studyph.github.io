In the Kingdom, there lived a king with only one leg and one eye. However, he was very intelligent and kind to his people. Everyone in the kingdom lived a happy and healthy life because of their king. One day, as the king was walking through the palace hallway, he saw the portraits of his ancestors. He thought that one day his children will walk in the same hallway and remember all the ancestors through these portraits. But, the king did not have his portrait painted. This was so because he wasn’t so sure how his physical disabilities will be portrayed in the painting. The next day, the King invited famous painters from all across the world. The king said, “I want a beautiful portrait of me to be placed in the palace. Any painter who can carry out this should come forward. He will be rewarded based on how the painting turns up.” All the famous painters thought for a while and stepped back. “How can this picture be made very beautiful? He has only one leg and one eye! It is impossible and if the picture does not turn out to look beautiful then the king will get angry and punish us.” So all the painters started to make excuses one by one and politely said no to make a painting of the king. Suddenly, one painter raised his hand and said, “I will make a very beautiful portrait of you which you will definitely like, my King.” The king was very happy to hear that. However, the other painters got puzzled and wanted to see what the other painter would make. The king granted him permission and the painter started to make his portrait. He then filled the portrait with different colors. At last, after a long time, he said, “My King, the portrait is ready!” All of the courtiers were very excited to see what the painter has made. When the painter finally presented the portrait, everyone in the court, including the King, was stunned. In the portrait, the King was sitting on the horse, on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one eye closed. The King was very pleased to see that the painter has made a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding his abilities. The King rewarded him with a lot of gold and gave him the title “Best Painter of the Kingdom”.​</a>

                                            What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                                            The Land of the Blue Flower The Land of the Blue Flower was not called by that name until the tall, strong, beautiful King Amor came down from his castle on the mountain crag and began to reign. Only once, when he was a boy of twelve, a strange and painful thing happened to him. From his kingdom in the plains below there had been sent to him a beautiful young horse which had been bred for him. Never had so magnificent an animal been born in the royal stable. When he was brought into the courtyard the boy King's eyes shone with joy. He spent the greater part of the morning in exercising and leaping him over barriers. The Ancient One in his tower chamber heard his shouts of exultation and encouragement. At last the King went out to try him on the winding mountain road. . When he returned he went at once to the tower chamber to the Ancient One, who, when he raised his eyes from his great book, looked at him gravely. "Let us climb to the battlements," the boy said. "We must talk together." So they went, and when they stood looking out on the world below, the curving turquoise sky above them, the eyes of the Ancient One were still more grave. "Tell me, young King." "Something strange has happened," King Amor answered. "I have felt something I have not felt before. I was riding my horse around the field on the plateau and he saw something which he refused to pass. It was a young leopard watching us from a tree. My horse reared and snorted. He would not listen to me, but backed and wheeled around. I tried in vain to persuade him, and suddenly, when I saw I could not make him obey me, this strange new feeling rushed through all my body. I grew hot and knew my face was scarlet, my heart beat faster and my blood seemed to boil in my veins. I shouted out harsh, ugly sounds—I forgot that all things are brothers--I lifted my hand and clenched it and struck my horse again and again. I loved him no longer, I felt that he no longer loved me. I am hot and wearied and heavy from it still. I feel no more joy. Was it pain I felt? I have never felt pain and do not know. Was it pain?" "It was a worse thing," answered the Ancient One. "It was anger. When a man is overcome by anger he has a poisone fever. He loses his strength, he loses his power over himse and over others, he throws away time in which he might ha gained the end he most desires.

                                            What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

                                            In olden times, on a faraway island of Palawan, there lived a cruel Sultan
who created a game for justice. The accused had to choose from two identical doors. One contained a beautiful suited lady for the man to marry, the other, a ferocious crocodile to devour them. The fate was to be decided by chance alone, and no one who knew of the placement behind the doors was allowed to inform him which to elect. The Sultan was highly satisfied with this system.
Now, the Sultan had a daughter, and he loved her very much. Dayang Marikit had fallen in love with one of her father's helper, and Sultan became so angry when he found out that he threw him in jail.
The Sultan searched for the most savage of crocodiles and the most beautiful maiden in all his land. No matter which door the young man selected, he would have the best that could be offered.
Dayang Marikit was distraught. Her love was either going to die, or be married to someone else! She has secretly bribed people to tell her who the
woman was, and it was someone who had tried to win over her love before, someone that Dayang Marikit deeply hated. The princess achieved something no one had before: She knew which fate was behind each door. She worked hard to learn the secret, using the power of her will and gold to secure it.
The day had come, and many had gathered. As the accused bowed to Sultan, he looked at the princess. He knew that she had found out where the crocodile and the lady were, and he asked with his eyes, "Which one?" She quickly lifted her hand to the right.
The young man approached the door on the right. He had no idea what was held inside, but either would make him unhappy. He only wanted the princess. He slowly opened the door.
Did the crocodile or the lady come out of the doorway? The princess
loved the young man, but she was also cruel like her father. The story stops exactly at the point at which the young man opens the door. It does not tell his fate.</a>

                            10. Read the given texts. Summarize each text using the appropriate graphic organizer. n A King’s Painting A long time ago, there was a Kingdom. In the Kingdom, there lived a king with only one leg and one eye. However, he was very intelligent and kind to his people. Everyone in the kingdom lived a happy and healthy life because of their king. One day, as the king was walking through the palace hallway, he saw the portraits of his ancestors. He thought that one day his children will walk in the same hallway and remember all the ancestors through these portraits. But, the king did not have his portrait painted. This was so because he wasn’t so sure how his physical disabilities will be portrayed in the painting. The next day, the King invited famous painters from all across the world. The king said, “I want a beautiful portrait of me to be placed in the palace. Any painter who can carry out this should come forward. He will be rewarded based on how the painting turns up.” All the famous painters thought for a while and stepped back. “How can this picture be made very beautiful? He has only one leg and one eye! It is impossible and if the picture does not turn out to look beautiful then the king will get angry and punish us.” So all the painters started to make excuses one by one and politely said no to make a painting of the king. Suddenly, one painter raised his hand and said, “I will make a very beautiful portrait of you which you will definitely like, my King.” The king was very happy to hear that. However, the other painters got puzzled and wanted to see what the other painter would make. The king granted him permission and the painter started to make his portrait. He then filled the portrait with different colors. At last, after a long time, he said, “My King, the portrait is ready!” All of the courtiers were very excited to see what the painter has made. When the painter finally presented the portrait, everyone in the court, including the King, was stunned. In the portrait, the King was sitting on the horse, on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one eye closed. The King was very pleased to see that the painter has made a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding his abilities. The King rewarded him with a lot of gold and gave him the title “Best Painter of the Kingdom”.​</h2><br />

                            15. What I Can Do Read the story and do what is asked. The Legend of the Lizard Long ago, there was a mother who loved her only son deeply. She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked. She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end Directions: After reading a story, write about how the story is similar or different from your own life by using the questions in the chart.

She therefore asked that he should - if he loved her as truly as he declared - cut out his mother's heart and bring it to her. The young man, blinded by love, dutifully slaughtered his beloved mother. It was exactly six o'clock in the evening, and his mother was reciting the Angelus then. He held the still beating heart in his hands as he rushed to where he knew the girl stood waiting. But when he got to their meeting-place, the girl was not there. Nothing was there - save for the realization of what he had done. The heart still beat, though it tarried long in the hands of the prodigal son. And then it began to speak. In his shock, the boy dropped the heart, and it fell into a crack in the ground. "Are you in pain, my child?" the mother's heart inquired. "Let me sing you a lullaby, to soothe you to sleep." The heart softly started singing, as lovingly as its owner would have done. And in the son's remorse he fell flat on his belly and kissed the ground that the heart lay on. The boy was so filled with guilt and grief that he did not notice himself changing, growing smaller, losing all his hair and clothing so that he was a tiny web-footed thing, that kissed and kissed at the ground as if begging for someone's forgiveness. At exactly six o'clock every night, when the Angelus strikes, the lizard comes down from the walls of the house, and crawls down to the floor, where it would make slight ticking sounds like quick kisses. It has been said that the lizard has not yet redeemed itself in its own eyes, and that with its tiny ears it could hear an ancient beating, and a lullaby that does not end.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The exposition of "Legend of the Lizard" is the introduction of the characters and the situation.

                            21. The Land of the Blue Flower The Land of the Blue Flower was not called by that name until the tall, strong, beautiful King Amor came down from his castle on the mountain crag and began to reign. Only once, when he was a boy of twelve, a strange and painful thing happened to him. From his kingdom in the plains below there had been sent to him a beautiful young horse which had been bred for him. Never had so magnificent an animal been born in the royal stable. When he was brought into the courtyard the boy King's eyes shone with joy. He spent the greater part of the morning in exercising and leaping him over barriers. The Ancient One in his tower chamber heard his shouts of exultation and encouragement. At last the King went out to try him on the winding mountain road. . When he returned he went at once to the tower chamber to the Ancient One, who, when he raised his eyes from his great book, looked at him gravely. "Let us climb to the battlements," the boy said. "We must talk together." So they went, and when they stood looking out on the world below, the curving turquoise sky above them, the eyes of the Ancient One were still more grave. "Tell me, young King." "Something strange has happened," King Amor answered. "I have felt something I have not felt before. I was riding my horse around the field on the plateau and he saw something which he refused to pass. It was a young leopard watching us from a tree. My horse reared and snorted. He would not listen to me, but backed and wheeled around. I tried in vain to persuade him, and suddenly, when I saw I could not make him obey me, this strange new feeling rushed through all my body. I grew hot and knew my face was scarlet, my heart beat faster and my blood seemed to boil in my veins. I shouted out harsh, ugly sounds—I forgot that all things are brothers--I lifted my hand and clenched it and struck my horse again and again. I loved him no longer, I felt that he no longer loved me. I am hot and wearied and heavy from it still. I feel no more joy. Was it pain I felt? I have never felt pain and do not know. Was it pain?" "It was a worse thing," answered the Ancient One. "It was anger. When a man is overcome by anger he has a poisone fever. He loses his strength, he loses his power over himse and over others, he throws away time in which he might ha gained the end he most desires. THERE IS NO TIME FOR ANGER IN THE WORLD." nasa itaas ang story ☝️☝️☝️☝️ nasa picture ang sasagutan ​</h2><br />

She was a pious woman and her son imitated most of her good deeds, which were many. Her son was good at heart, but young. The woman knew that he still had much to learn before he could fully adopt saintly ways. God decided to test this young son's piety and love for his mother. He sent a beautiful woman to capture the young man's eager heart. The beautiful woman urged the son to keep their meetings a secret from his mother, and though it pained the boy to do so, for he never kept secrets from his mother, he obeyed. But the real challenge had not yet been failed. The beautiful woman beguiled the boy so that she was able to make him promise that he would do anything she asked.

                            26. In olden times, on a faraway island of Palawan, there lived a cruel Sultan
who created a game for justice. The accused had to choose from two identical doors. One contained a beautiful suited lady for the man to marry, the other, a ferocious crocodile to devour them. The fate was to be decided by chance alone, and no one who knew of the placement behind the doors was allowed to inform him which to elect. The Sultan was highly satisfied with this system.
Now, the Sultan had a daughter, and he loved her very much. Dayang Marikit had fallen in love with one of her father's helper, and Sultan became so angry when he found out that he threw him in jail.
The Sultan searched for the most savage of crocodiles and the most beautiful maiden in all his land. No matter which door the young man selected, he would have the best that could be offered.
Dayang Marikit was distraught. Her love was either going to die, or be married to someone else! She has secretly bribed people to tell her who the
woman was, and it was someone who had tried to win over her love before, someone that Dayang Marikit deeply hated. The princess achieved something no one had before: She knew which fate was behind each door. She worked hard to learn the secret, using the power of her will and gold to secure it.
The day had come, and many had gathered. As the accused bowed to Sultan, he looked at the princess. He knew that she had found out where the crocodile and the lady were, and he asked with his eyes, "Which one?" She quickly lifted her hand to the right.
The young man approached the door on the right. He had no idea what was held inside, but either would make him unhappy. He only wanted the princess. He slowly opened the door.
Did the crocodile or the lady come out of the doorway? The princess
loved the young man, but she was also cruel like her father. The story stops exactly at the point at which the young man opens the door. It does not tell his fate.</h2><br />
