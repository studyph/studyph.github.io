Write the correct letter on the line. Column A Column B A. The lateritic soils, ie, soils rich in oxides of aluminum, iron, and silicon are abundant in tropical regions. They are another good example of materials that provide strong interparticle bonds between particles in cyclic wetting and drying processes in nature. B. Electrical current is the movement of charged particles, either electrons or ions, through a conductor. A voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses a chemical reaction to produce electrical energy. &lt; C. Negative ions are smaller and lighter and are more likely to become airbome while positive ions are heavier and tend to fall to the ground. Thus, the concentration of negative ions is greater in the atmosphere near moving water. Rainstorms, waterfalls, rain showers, rivers and crashing waves are natural negative ions generators. D. The shape of snowflakes results from bonding (and intermolecular) forces in H²O. The attractive force between a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another. The snowflake is symmetrical. E. The formation of water molecules in these clouds collide with one another, chipping off electrons and creating an electric charge2. Fission occurs due to the separation between the positively and negatively charged particles in the upper and bottom portions of the clouds, respectively. At the same time, the negatively charged particles, or electrons, migrate to the bottom of the clouds. These electrons create a repulsion towards the electrons on the earth's surface that causes positively charged particles or protons to move up to the ground's surface.​</a>

Column A Column B A. The lateritic soils, ie, soils rich in oxides of aluminum, iron, and silicon are abundant in tropical regions. They are another good example of materials that provide strong interparticle bonds between particles in cyclic wetting and drying processes in nature. B. Electrical current is the movement of charged particles, either electrons or ions, through a conductor. A voltaic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses a chemical reaction to produce electrical energy. &lt; C. Negative ions are smaller and lighter and are more likely to become airbome while positive ions are heavier and tend to fall to the ground. Thus, the concentration of negative ions is greater in the atmosphere near moving water. Rainstorms, waterfalls, rain showers, rivers and crashing waves are natural negative ions generators. D. The shape of snowflakes results from bonding (and intermolecular) forces in H²O. The attractive force between a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another. The snowflake is symmetrical. E. The formation of water molecules in these clouds collide with one another, chipping off electrons and creating an electric charge2. Fission occurs due to the separation between the positively and negatively charged particles in the upper and bottom portions of the clouds, respectively. At the same time, the negatively charged particles, or electrons, migrate to the bottom of the clouds. These electrons create a repulsion towards the electrons on the earth's surface that causes positively charged particles or protons to move up to the ground's surface.​</h2><br />
