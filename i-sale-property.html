                                            made the statement to my dad that when I get my own place, I will not allow smoking. My dad got extremely upset and told me to leave the house and not to come back until my attitude changed. So I left the house and walked to a friend's house. When I cooled down and I thought my dad had cooled down, I went home. Well, my attitude has never changed; I just never brought up the subject again to my dad. What I didn't realize back then was just how dangerous secondhand smoke was. But what exactly is secondhand smoke? The article titled "Secondhand Smoke" defines it as "a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers" (1). What does exposure to secondhand smoke do? "It causes irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. It can also irritate the lungs, leading to coughing, excess phlegm, chest discomfort, and reduced lung function" (1). This article also states that secondhand smoke has been classified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a known cause of lung cancer in humans. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are also more likely to have reduced lung function and symptoms of respiratory irritation such as cough, Children are more susceptible to the dangers of secondhand smoke because their lungs are still developing and growing. par "...Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of premature death in the United States, killing over 50,000 Americans each year, according to the Surgeon General. Secondhand smoke is also a severe threat to children, causing hundreds of thousands of cases of bronchitis and pneumonia each year" (Waxman 1). ... As long as people continue to smoke tobacco, secondhand smoke will threaten the health of nonsmokers. Please discuss smoking and the effects of secondhand smoke with your children. Hopefully, in time, we will be able to eliminate this nasty habit and save many thousands of innocent lives. t, will be able to some n http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/wr122/handouts/analysis.htm ARTM Directions: The excerpt above was classified as informational, convincing, and arguing.

                                            A young and powerful billionaire suddenly dies of a heart attack. He left behind 3 sons, to whom he left most of his estate. The eldest is Adam, followed by Ethan, and the youngest is Lucas. Among his properties were 11 mansions that he wished to be divided among his children. On his will, he indicated that half of his mansions will be inherited by his eldest son, a quarter will be for his second son, and a sixth will go to his youngest son. He specified in his will that he is not allowing his sons to sell the properties and divide the money that they get from the sales.
They went to their mother for advice. She said, “I will include one of my mansions to your 11, to make 12 in all. Now you can divide them.”
Adam: 1/2 of the mansions = 6
Ethan: 1/4 of the mansions = 3
Lucas: 1/6 of the mansion = 2
“Since 6 + 3 + 2 = 11, I get my mansion back, and you are able to divide the properties among yourselves.”
How did the mother solve the problem? Was the billionaire’s will carried out correctly? Justify your answer.</a>

My dad got extremely upset and told me to leave the house and not to come back until my attitude changed. So I left the house and walked to a friend's house. When I cooled down and I thought my dad had cooled down, I went home. Well, my attitude has never changed; I just never brought up the subject again to my dad. What I didn't realize back then was just how dangerous secondhand smoke was. But what exactly is secondhand smoke? The article titled "Secondhand Smoke" defines it as "a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers" (1). What does exposure to secondhand smoke do? "It causes irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. It can also irritate the lungs, leading to coughing, excess phlegm, chest discomfort, and reduced lung function" (1). This article also states that secondhand smoke has been classified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a known cause of lung cancer in humans. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are also more likely to have reduced lung function and symptoms of respiratory irritation such as cough, Children are more susceptible to the dangers of secondhand smoke because their lungs are still developing and growing. par "...Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of premature death in the United States, killing over 50,000 Americans each year, according to the Surgeon General. Secondhand smoke is also a severe threat to children, causing hundreds of thousands of cases of bronchitis and pneumonia each year" (Waxman 1). ... As long as people continue to smoke tobacco, secondhand smoke will threaten the health of nonsmokers. Please discuss smoking and the effects of secondhand smoke with your children.

                            23. A young and powerful billionaire suddenly dies of a heart attack. He left behind 3 sons, to whom he left most of his estate. The eldest is Adam, followed by Ethan, and the youngest is Lucas. Among his properties were 11 mansions that he wished to be divided among his children. On his will, he indicated that half of his mansions will be inherited by his eldest son, a quarter will be for his second son, and a sixth will go to his youngest son. He specified in his will that he is not allowing his sons to sell the properties and divide the money that they get from the sales.
They went to their mother for advice. She said, “I will include one of my mansions to your 11, to make 12 in all. Now you can divide them.”
Adam: 1/2 of the mansions = 6
Ethan: 1/4 of the mansions = 3
Lucas: 1/6 of the mansion = 2
“Since 6 + 3 + 2 = 11, I get my mansion back, and you are able to divide the properties among yourselves.”
How did the mother solve the problem? Was the billionaire’s will carried out correctly? Justify your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p>First we need to take the initial number of mansions that the billionaire has left behind.
</p><p>He had a total of <strong>11</strong> mansions if the sons were to divide the mansions between each other with <strong>11</strong>, they would end up with:
</p><p>Adam : 11 x ½ = 5.5
</p><p>Ethan: 11 x ¼ = 2.75
</p><p>Lucas: 11 x 1/6 =  1.83
</p><p>That would then give the sons a reason to fight over who gets which mansion and what part of the mansions.
</p><p>Now since the mother added her mansion to the equation, the total number of mansions would end up being <strong>12</strong>.  </p><p>With the total number of <strong>12</strong> mansions, the boys are then able to properly distribute the mansions accordingly.
</p><p>Adam : 12 x ½ = 6
</p><p>Ethan: 12 x ¼ = 3
</p><p>Lucas: 12 x 1/6 =  2
</p><p>Now since 6 + 3 + 2 = 11, the mother is able to keep the mansion she offered. All sons got their mansions and the billionaires will was carried out correctly.</p><br /><br />
