                                            Digital marketing plays a valuable role in shaping consumer behavior in today’s world, Traditional advertising can cost large sums of money, whether it be via television, radio, newspaper, magazine, or direct mail. Now business owners can find a cheap equivalent online. Think YouTube instead of television, blogs instead of magazines, social media instead of flyers, and podcasts instead of the radio. Some of the digital equivalents to traditional advertising are free, and all can be much cheaper than their traditional counterparts if the business has someone to manage and develop its strategies.
The great thing about digital marketing is that those who use it can easily check their reputation and engage with unsatisfied customers, making it possible for them to address negative press before it circulates too far and too wide. Just because a business doesn’t take advantage of the web and social media doesn’t mean that its customers don’t. It is far better to know what is going on as it happens than to find out the hard way along with everyone else.</a>

Just because a business doesn’t take advantage of the web and social media doesn’t mean that its customers don’t.
