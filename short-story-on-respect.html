                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A couple of years ago, I stumbled off the subway in Upper Manhattan, exhausted after a long and stressful day at work, dreaming about the warmth of my bed. I stopped in a 7/11 on the way to my apartment to buy a bag of popcorn (treat yourself!). A man about three times my size stood in front of me at the register buying a pack of cigarettes and turned toward me, telling me I looked tired. I smiled uncomfortably and became noticeably more alert, as a young woman does when a strange man starts talking to her at night. He turned toward the cashier and said that he was going to get my snack too. I politely declined and was already pulling out my wallet, but this man wouldn’t allow me to say no. He handed the cashier a couple of extra dollars to cover my popcorn and told me that he hoped my night got better. He walked out of the store and I never saw him again.</p><p><strong>Explanation: mahaba po eh pero hope it helps po</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>( 1 )    My neighbor Jim had trouble deciding if he wanted to retire from the construction field until he ran into a younger man he’d worked with previously. The man had a wife and three children, and was finding it difficult to make ends meet, as he hadn’t worked in some time. The next morning Jim went to the union office and submitted his retirement paperwork. As for his replacement, he gave them the name of struggling young man. That was six years ago, and that young husband and father has been employed ever since. —Miranda MacLean, Brutus, Michigan. If this inspired you, try these small acts of kindness that will instantly brighten someone’s day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>( 2 )    While going through a divorce, my mother fretted over her new worries: no income, the same bills, and no way to afford groceries. It was around this time that she started finding boxes of food outside our door every morning. This went on for months until she was able to land a job. We never did find out who left the groceries, but they truly saved our lives. —Jamie Boleyn, Emmett, Idaho</p><p></p><p></p><p>( 3 )    I forgot about the rule preventing liquids in carry-on luggage, so when I hit security at the airport, I had to give up all my painting supplies. When I returned a week later, an attendant was at the baggage area with my paints. Not only had he kept them for me, but he’d looked up my return date and time in order to meet me. —Marilyn Kinsella, Canmore, Canada</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>( 4 )    One evening, I left a restaurant just ahead of a woman assisting her elderly mom. I approached the curb and paused to see if my arthritic knees could climb it. To my right appeared an arm to assist. It was that of the elderly mom. My heart was so touched. —Donna Moerie, Goldsboro, North Carolina</p><p></p><p></p><p>( 5 )   I was balancing caring for a toddler and working a full-time job, all while my Navy husband was on extended duty overseas. One evening the doorbell rang. It was my neighbor, a retired chief petty officer, holding a breadboard loaded with a freshly cooked chicken and vegetable stew. “I’ve noticed you’re getting a little skinny,” he said. It was the best meal I’d had in months. —Patricia Fordney, Corvallis, Oregon</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippine mythology is the body of stories and epics originating from, and part of, the indigenous Philippine folk religions, which include various ethnic faiths distinct from one another. Philippine mythology is incorporated from various sources, having similarities with Indonesian and Malay myths, as well as Hindu, Muslim, Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian traditions, such as the notion of heaven (kaluwalhatian, kalangitan, kamurawayan, etc.), hell (kasamaan, sulad, etc.), and the human soul (kaluluwa, kaulolan, makatu, ginokud, etc.). Philippine mythology attempts to explain the nature of the world through the lives and actions of heroes, deities (referred to as anito or diwata in some ethnic groups), and mythological creatures. The majority of these myths were passed on through oral tradition, and preserved through the aid of community spiritual leaders or shamans (babaylan, katalonan, mumbaki, baglan, machanitu, walian, mangubat, bahasa, etc.) and community elders.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Portrait of the first man, Malakas, and woman, Maganda, who came out from a bamboo pecked by the bird form of the deity of peace, Amihan, in Tagalog mythology</p><p></p><p>The Maranao people believe that Lake Lanao is a gap that resulted in the transfer of Mantapoli into the center of the world.</p><p>The mythologies and indigenous religions of the Philippines have historically been referred to as Anitism, meaning "ancestral religion".[1][2] Other terms used were Anitismo, a Hispano-Filipino translation, and Anitería, a derogatory version used by most members of the Spanish clergy.[3] Today, many ethnic peoples continue to practice and conserve their unique indigenous religions, notably in ancestral domains, although foreign and foreign-inspired religions continue to influence their life-ways through conversions, inter-marriage, and land-buying. A number of scholarly works have been devoted to Anitism and its various aspects, although many of its stories and traditions have yet to be recorded by specialists in the fields of anthropology and folklore.[1][4][5]</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the midst of this global pandemic, we are reflecting in real-time on how systems undergo large-scale transformation—how government, businesses, schools, cities, and communities adapt and make fundamental changes to existing ways of working. This issue of systems change and, more specifically, how education initiatives scale and spread, is a topic that we at the Center for Universal Education (CUE) have been exploring in our Real-time Scaling Labs over the past year. These scaling labs—action research projects led by CUE and undertaken in partnership with local institutions across five countries—are an effort to learn how effective education practices scale across communities and countries. Through learning from, documenting, and supporting the process of expanding and deepening the impact of education initiatives around the world, the labs aim to develop concrete, practical guidance on key drivers that contribute to large-scale transformative change in education.
</p><p>
</p><p>Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we had been reflecting with our partners on how difficult it is to change a system: Systems prefer the status quo and often require a crisis to transform. We are certainly watching this play out today—many countries have been slow to respond to the global pandemic despite significant data and advice from experts on what measures are needed—and have only leapt into action once the magnitude of the virus was apparent.
</p><p>
</p><p>As the world grapples with responding to the current crisis, we are struck that some of the same key principles we have been studying in the Real-time Scaling Labs might also be relevant in responding to this pandemic. These include:
</p><p>
</p><p>Iterative, adaptive learning. Flexibility and adaptive capacity are crucial at a time when events unfold rapidly, and households, communities, and leaders must constantly adjust to a new reality on a day-by-day basis. The situation has also brought to the forefront a deeper appreciation of the importance of reliable, high-quality, timely data for decisionmaking, while acknowledging the limitations of existing data in representing the true scope of a rapidly shifting crisis. At the same time, we are witnessing firsthand what behavioral science has long shown—that data alone are not always enough to spur change as attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are deeply ingrained in people and institutions.
</p><p>
The COVID-19 crisis is already having and will continue to have devastating consequences for individuals and communities across the globe, which must not be underestimated. At the same time, the crisis also provides a critical opportunity for us to learn more about the essential principles underpinning large-scale transformative change, as is needed in many education systems around the world. The hope is that we can come out on the other side of this pandemic with more evidence and lessons learned about how to expand the impact of effective social interventions and introduce new ways of working within our education systems to provide quality learning opportunities to all.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The Scent of Apples
<p>By Bienvenido N. Santos
</p><p><strong>CONTEXT:</strong> Literary
</p><p><strong>AUTHOR’S INTENTION:  </strong>
</p><p> “Scent of Apples” tells the story of one man and his family’s unique experience as Filipino immigrants to the United States. It’s a unique story, as Santos himself is a character in it. Santos wrote “Scent of Apples” during the Rebirth of Freedom—a period of activism following WWII and the restoration of independence to the Philippines.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Scent of Apples” reminds us of the struggles Filipinos experienced letting go of their homeland and trying to make a new life with nothing but memories of how things used to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>The irony of the title  and in relation to homesickness doesn’t quite match. It’s because the scent of apples remind the author or the main character of the story about his country which is the Philippines. However, apples do not locally grown on Philippine soil. Therefore, the nostalgia actually roots from the absence of apples in the Philippines.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21015388</p><br />
