A. Directions: Read the article below. Take note of the important points being raised.
Then, do the task below.
 Poverty 
The Philippines is faced with a number of issues that concern our organization. We
are passionate about raising awareness of these issues and developing grass-roots
solutions. Poverty, unemployment and environmental legislation are the major issues
facing the country, and these problems have resulted in a large number of Filipinos
moving overseas for work. We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some
of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment.
Make a stand: Who is responsible for poverty in our country, government or people?
Why? Then, state your reason.
Government, why? _________________________________________

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping the planet warm enough to sustain life. The enhanced greenhouse effect, on the other hand, is the additional warming effect that occurs when human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to an overall increase in the Earth's temperature. Both the greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect can lead to an increase in the Earth's average global temperature, which can have significant impacts on the planet's climate and ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>2. Climate change can have both positive and negative effects on the Earth. Some of the benefits of climate change include longer growing seasons for crops, increased access to resources in some regions, and reduced winter heating costs. However, the negative impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and intense weather events, and loss of biodiversity, far outweigh any potential benefits.</p><p></p><p>3. It is important to be aware of environmental issues like global warming and climate change because they pose a significant threat to the planet's ecosystems and human society. These issues can lead to more frequent and severe weather events, food and water shortages, and displacement of people from low-lying areas. By being aware of these issues, individuals and communities can take action to reduce their carbon footprint, conserve resources, and advocate for policies that address climate change.</p><br />

                            9. Why is it important to be socially aware and
responsible about environmental issues and concerns?</h2><br />
                        It’s important to be socially aware cause Social awareness helps children in improving their social skills by interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.

What is the difference between the greenhouse effect and enhanced greenhouse effect? How do they affect Earth's average global temperature? 2. How does climate change help Earth? 3. Why is it important for people to be aware of environmental issues like global warming and climate change?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The greenhouse effect is how heat is retained by the atmosphere due to greenhouse gases whereas the enhanced greenhouse effect is the impact on the climate from the additional heat retained due to the increased amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that humans have released into the earth's atmosphere since the industrial revolution.</p><p>2. Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</p><p>3. Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.</p><br />

The Philippines is faced with a number of issues that concern our organization. We
are passionate about raising awareness of these issues and developing grass-roots
solutions. Poverty, unemployment and environmental legislation are the major issues
facing the country, and these problems have resulted in a large number of Filipinos
moving overseas for work. We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some
of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment.
Make a stand: Who is responsible for poverty in our country, government or people?
Why? Then, state your reason.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. climate change has rainy days, so it helps to give water to plants</p><p></p><p>2. it is important to be aware of issues so we don't have many problems and secondly, it helps us to not get hurt by these environmental issues</p><p></p><p>hope it helps</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.As the earth's atmosphere heats up, it collects, retains, and drops more water, changing weather patterns and making wet areas wetter and dry areas drier. Higher temperatures worsen and increase the frequency of many types of disasters, including storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts.</p><p></p><p>2.It's important that we understand how the climate is changing, so that we can prepare for the future. Studying the climate helps us predict how much rain the next winter might bring, or how far sea levels will rise due to warmer sea temperatures.Raising awareness and thereby understanding of the effects of climate change on health will facilitate both behavioural change and societal support for the actions needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. Why is it important for people to be aware of environmental issues like global warming and climate change?​</h2><br />
                        <p>→ Climate change affects everyone, and future generations will require a suitable planet on which to live. This can be accomplished through environmental stewardship.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>✨Global Warming Importance</p><p>Global Warming is important since it helps determine future climate expectations. Through the use of latitude, one can determine the likelihood of snow and hail reaching the surface. You can also be able to identify the thermal energy from the sun that is accessible to a region. Global Warming is the scientific study of climates, which is defined as the mean weather conditions over a period of time. A branch of study within atmospheric sciences, it also takes into account the variables and averages of short-term and long-term weather conditions. Global warming is the unequivocal and continuing rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system. Since 1971, 90% of the warming has occurred in the oceans. Despite the oceans' dominant role in energy storage, the term "global warming" is also used to refer to increases in average temperature of the air and sea at Earth's surface. Since the early 20th century, the global air and sea surface temperature has increased about 0.8 Â°C (1.4 Â°F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850. Global Warming uses from OMICS Group are an open access journal named as Journal of Climatology and Weather Forecasting which strives to release issues quarterly and is adamant to publish new findings related to the field of Global Warming. The mission of the Global Warming uses provides a forum for publishing new findings on Environmental principles and technology. Currently our primary research objective is to encourage and assist the development of better and faster measures of Environmental activity. In cases where we believe we can contribute directly, as opposed to through highlighting the work of others, we are producing our own measures of Global Warming.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>F</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>W</strong><strong> </strong><strong>O</strong><strong>R</strong><strong> </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>F</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>U</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>T</strong><p><strong>M</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>K</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>Z</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>1</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>T</strong><strong>O</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warmer planet. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it helps to regulate the planet's temperature and keeps it habitable. However, the enhanced greenhouse effect refers to the increase in the concentration of these greenhouse gases due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This has resulted in a significant warming of the planet, leading to climate change.</p><p></p><p>Climate change does not necessarily help the Earth, as it has negative effects on the environment, such as sea level rise, more frequent and intense natural disasters, loss of biodiversity, and changes in weather patterns that can affect agriculture and human health. However, climate change can help spur awareness and action on environmental issues, leading to more sustainable practices and technologies that can benefit the planet in the long term.</p><p></p><p>It is important to be aware of environmental issues like global warming and climate change because they have significant impacts on the Earth's ecosystems, human health, and economies. By understanding these issues, we can take actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change, such as by transitioning to renewable energy, promoting sustainable agriculture and transportation, and protecting natural habitats. Being aware of these issues can also help us make informed decisions as consumers and voters, and drive policies that support a more sustainable and resilient future.</p><br />
