Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</a>

                                            READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven. You ask for forgiveness of what you did wrong. God is always happy when we come back to Him!Jesus loves us, and, He will welcome us just like the son was welcomed back home by his father.QUESTION.*If you are the lost or the prodigal one, what would you do to actually ask for forgiveness from your father and older brother?____________​</a>

                                            In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1. What is Equiano's main petition in his letter? What is he asking the Queen to grant? 2. What does Equiano's letter imply about the condition of the "wretched Africans"? What does he mean by the phrase? 3. According to Equiano, what reward could the Queen receive if she grants his petition? 4. Do you think this letter was effective in terms of conveying Equiano's true intentions? Why why not?​</a>

What ideal state of governance could be inferred from the selection?the storyBook XVI. Ke SheChapter I.1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Rulers of the state and chiefs of families are most troubled about maintaining order and keeping their people in their designated places within society. They are concerned with ensuring that the people are content and at peace, rather than worried about poverty or the number of people in their society.</p><p></p><p>The state should satisfy the people by ensuring that they are content in their designated places within society and by promoting harmony and order. It should also cultivate virtues and civil culture to attract and subdue any unruly or rebellious people.</p><p></p><p>The principle mentioned in the last paragraph is that people should strive to fulfill their designated roles within society and not try to rise above their place or seek power that is not rightfully theirs. This means that people should be content with their position and not try to disrupt the social order.</p><p></p><p>The ideal state of governance inferred from the selection is one where the rulers are concerned with the contentment and well-being of the people, and where the people fulfill their designated roles within society. This state is characterized by harmony, order, and virtue, and is governed by principles of justice and fairness.</p><br />

                            6. READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven. You ask for forgiveness of what you did wrong. God is always happy when we come back to Him!Jesus loves us, and, He will welcome us just like the son was welcomed back home by his father.QUESTION.*If you are the lost or the prodigal one, what would you do to actually ask for forgiveness from your father and older brother?____________​</h2><br />

                            12. In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1. What is Equiano's main petition in his letter? What is he asking the Queen to grant? 2. What does Equiano's letter imply about the condition of the "wretched Africans"? What does he mean by the phrase? 3. According to Equiano, what reward could the Queen receive if she grants his petition? 4. Do you think this letter was effective in terms of conveying Equiano's true intentions? Why why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Olaudah <strong>Equiano</strong>, a <strong>prominent abolitionist </strong>in the <strong>18th century</strong> mainly petitioned to help his fellow Africans from the slavery that they were experiencing under the <strong>Atlantic Slave Trade</strong>. He was asking the Queen of England to help his countrymen and give them equal rights as that what the freemen have. He wanted to abolish the system of <strong>slavery </strong>in that century.</p><p></p><p>Equiano implies that the <strong>wretched Africans</strong> were poorly treated, even abused, and treated unfairly. They experience tyranny under the masters they serve. They are oppressed for being negroes.</p><p></p><p>The people which the queen reigned will give her more of their approval because of her benevolence and compassion regarding the plight of the Africans under their slavery. Equiano said that if the queen helped it will bring happiness and blessings to her government, the people in it, and the Africans and their descendants.</p><p></p><p>I think the letter is effective because Equiano repeatedly shows his respect, empathy, and wit while writing the letter. He also used the word benevolence a lot of times which might get the attention and sympathy of the queen. He tried to psychologically, politically, and emotionally speak to the queen.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to learn more about the prejudice against Africans, kindly please take your time to visit this link:https://brainly.ph/question/2872474</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
