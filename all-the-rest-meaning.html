                                            The state of motion of an object is affected by the forces acting on it. The book is at rest because the net force (sum of all external forces acting on it is zero (0). When the net force acting on a system is zero, it means that the external forces are balanced. This means that the object is either at rest or at constant motion. Forces can balance each other if they act on the same system. If, however, the forces are acting on two different systems, they will not cancel each other. q) Observe the forces in figure 4. Do action-reaction forces act on the same system? 1) Can we say that the action-reaction forces cancel each other? Why? s) Describe Newton's third law of motion using all the key points in this activity.​</a>

                        Okay, let's analyze the meaning of the bolded words in those sentences:<p></p><strong>Tortuous:</strong> winding, twisting, convoluted. In this sentence, it means a winding, twisting road that curves and bends in a complicated manner.<strong>Cynosure:</strong> something that attracts attention or admiration. In this sentence, it means the center of attention or focus. The new Miss Philippines was the cynosure (focus) of all attention and eyes.<p></p>Some synonyms for tortuous could be winding, twisting, zigzag, convoluted.Some synonyms for cynosure could be focus, center of attention, focal point.<p></p>So in summary:<p></p><p>Tortuous road = winding, twisting road</p><p>Cynosure of all eyes = center of attention, focus of all eyes</p><p></p><p>Does this help explain the meaning and usage of those words in the sentences?

                            17. The state of motion of an object is affected by the forces acting on it. The book is at rest because the net force (sum of all external forces acting on it is zero (0). When the net force acting on a system is zero, it means that the external forces are balanced. This means that the object is either at rest or at constant motion. Forces can balance each other if they act on the same system. If, however, the forces are acting on two different systems, they will not cancel each other. q) Observe the forces in figure 4. Do action-reaction forces act on the same system? 1) Can we say that the action-reaction forces cancel each other? Why? s) Describe Newton's third law of motion using all the key points in this activity.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:An object with no net forces acting on it which is initially at rest will remain at rest. If it is moving, it will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity. Forces are "pushes" or "pulls" on the object, and forces, like velocity and acceleration are vector quantities.</strong><p></p><br />
