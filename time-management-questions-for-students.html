                                            Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one. A simple one for five points. This will be easy! Having answered the first question each of the students turned the page for question number two: Which tire? (95 points).</a>

They also often move around during class discussion and work through written tasks quickly resulting in haphazard answers. The only time they are engaged is when there are hands-on activities for them to do. So, the teacher decided to sit them together in class to make it easier for her to manage them.

Thus, this mainly focuses on the problems that they face while answering the given modules. Generally, this research seeks to answer the following questions:1. What are the challenges that modular learning students encounter?2. What are the thoughts and feelings of students about the new distance learning?3. How does the student manage his/her time?4.

                        <p>1.

The distance learning tells us students that education is a priviledge, not a right. There are instances that we are required to pass the activities on time even though our internet connection is slow, their solution is we either pass it early or buy a load, what about the working students or the students who belong to the poorest family? </p><p></p><br />

                            14. LEARNING TASK 3. INTERVIEW Instructions: Conduct an interview about the importance of nutrient management and water management that are usually used by some farmers in producing rice. Suggested questions to be asked during interview: 1.Based from your own experiences is it true that the kind of fertilizer greatly affect the rice yield? Yes or No and Why? 2. For you what is the best fertilizer to use and suitable in rice production? 3. When is the best time of applying fertilizer in order to attain good production? 4. Do you use same kind of fertilizer in every stage of application? 5. How important is irrigation system in rice production? Will you please share with us your opinion and experiences in this matter? 6. What are the particular problems or challenges that you usually encounter in terms of water and nutrient managementa Will you please share with us the solutions given to these problems? 7. In this time of New normal, what message or advice can you give especially with students who are striving hard to educate in this kind of field in agriculture?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes,Studies have shown that different fertilizer types, as well as fertilization modes and rates directly affect rice yield and quality [11–13]. </p><p>2. Why apply N FERTILIZER to rice</p><p>Nitrogen is the most limiting element in almost all soils. Thus, proper application of N fertilizers is vital to improve crop growth and grain yields, especially in intensive agricultural systems.</p><p>3.SPRING</p><p>Fertilizer is most effective when used on plants at their peak growing cycle. This is when the plant is leafing out for deciduous species, flowering, or putting on new growth after leaving the dormant winter stage. The time of year for fertilizing most plants would then be spring.</p><p></p><p>5.Water is a precious and scarce resource input in rice production, so it is very important that irrigation water is used wisely and efficiently. The current way growing irrigated rice in most Asian rice farms requires large amounts of water.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan lang ung alam ko pero tama ung mga yan hindi ko na alam ung sa iba hope it helps thank you</p><br />

                            21. Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one. A simple one for five points. This will be easy! Having answered the first question each of the students turned the page for question number two: Which tire? (95 points).</h2><br />
