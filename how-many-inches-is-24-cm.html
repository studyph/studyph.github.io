                            30. Solve each problem. Draw an illustration if necessary. 1. Jason is wrapping a present. The box he is using is a rectangular prism with a length of 18 inches, a width 10 inches, and a height of 4 inches. Find how many square inches of paper he needs to wrap the entire box. 2. 3. A certain music box has the shape of a cube. Each side of the music box is 15 centimeters long. What is the surface area of the box? A salt container has the shape of a cylinder. The radius of the container is 1.5 inches and the height his 6 inches. Find the surface area of the container. Use = 3.14. A cylinder shaped water pitcher has a radius of 5 inches and a height of 12.5 inches. Find the surface area of the pitcher. If the length of each side of a cube is increased by 50%, what is the percent increase in the surface area of the cube? Find the amount of tin needed to make a milk tin can that has a radius of 2.5 cm and a height of 5 cm. Calculate the surface area of each prism. Write the surface area in square meters. 3 m 4 m A 11 m 9 m 5 m 10 m 26 m 24 m 50 m​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. The surface area of the rectangular prism is given by 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height, respectively. Plugging in the values, we get:2lw + 2lh + 2wh= 2(18)(10) + 2(18)(4) + 2(10)(4)= 360 + 144 + 80= 584Therefore, Jason needs 584 square inches of paper to wrap the entire box.2. The surface area of a cube is given by 6s^2, where s is the length of each side. Plugging in the value, we get:6(15^2)= 6(225)= 1350Therefore, the surface area of the cube is 1350 square centimeters.3. The surface area of a cylinder is given by 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get:2(3.14)(1.5^2) + 2(3.14)(1.5)(6)= 28.26Therefore, the surface area of the cylinder is 28.26 square inches.4. The surface area of a cylinder is given by 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get:2(3.14)(5^2) + 2(3.14)(5)(12.5)= 471.25Therefore, the surface area of the pitcher is 471.25 square inches.5. The surface area of a cube is given by 6s^2, where s is the length of each side. If each side is increased by 50%, the new length becomes 1.5s. Therefore, the new surface area is:6(1.5s)^2= 6(2.25s^2)= 13.5s^2The percent increase is given by: (new surface area - old surface area) / old surface area x 100%. Plugging in the values, we get:(13.5s^2 - 6s^2) / 6s^2 x 100%= 125%Therefore, the percent increase in the surface area is 125%.6. The surface area of a cylinder is given by 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height. The amount of tin needed to make the milk tin can is equal to the surface area of the cylinder. Plugging in the values, we get:2(3.14)(2.5^2) + 2(3.14)(2.5)(5)= 94.25Therefore, the amount of tin needed to make the milk tin can is 94.25 cubic centimeters.7. To find the surface area of each prism, we use the formula 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height, respectively. Plugging in the values, we get:Surface area of the first prism = 2(3)(4) + 2(3)(11) + 2(4)(11) = 102 square metersSurface area of the second prism = 2(9)(5) + 2(9)(10) + 2(5)(10) = 340 square metersSurface area of the third prism = 2(24)(26) + 2(24)(50) + 2(26)(50) = 5024 square metersTherefore, the surface area of each prism is 102 square meters, 340 square meters, and 5024 square meters, respectively.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>th</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>correct </strong><strong>answer </strong><strong>trust </strong><strong>me,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>please </strong><strong>brainliest</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. To find the surface area of the rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and add them up. </p><p></p><p>- The area of the top and bottom faces (which are the same) is length x width = 18 x 10 = 180 square inches. </p><p>- The area of the front and back faces (which are the same) is length x height = 18 x 4 = 72 square inches. </p><p>- The area of the two side faces (which are the same) is width x height = 10 x 4 = 40 square inches. </p><p></p><p>So the total surface area is: </p><p></p><p>180 + 180 + 72 + 72 + 40 + 40 = 544 square inches </p><p></p><p>Therefore, Jason needs 544 square inches of paper to wrap the entire box. </p><p></p><p>2. Since all six sides of a cube are the same, we can find the surface area by multiplying the length of one side by itself, and then multiplying by 6 (for the six sides). </p><p></p><p>15 x 15 = 225 </p><p></p><p>225 x 6 = 1350 </p><p></p><p>So the surface area of the cube is 1350 square centimeters. </p><p></p><p>3. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is: </p><p></p><p>2 x pi x radius x height + 2 x pi x radius^2 </p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values: </p><p></p><p>2 x 3.14 x 1.5 x 6 + 2 x 3.14 x 1.5^2 = 56.52 </p><p></p><p>So the surface area of the cylinder is 56.52 square inches. </p><p></p><p>4. If the length of each side of a cube is increased by 50%, then the new length of each side is 1.5 times the original length. </p><p></p><p>The formula for the surface area of a cube is: </p><p></p><p>6 x (side length)^2 </p><p></p><p>So the original surface area is: </p><p></p><p>6 x 15^2 = 1350 </p><p></p><p>The new surface area is: </p><p></p><p>6 x (1.5 x 15)^2 = 6 x 33.75^2 = 6744.38 </p><p></p><p>The percent increase is: </p><p></p><p>((new surface area - original surface area) / original surface area) x 100% </p><p></p><p>= ((6744.38 - 1350) / 1350) x 100% </p><p></p><p>= 399.56% </p><p></p><p>So the percent increase in the surface area of the cube is approximately 399.56%. </p><p></p><p>5. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is the same as in problem 3: </p><p></p><p>2 x pi x radius x height + 2 x pi x radius^2 </p><p></p><p>Plugging in the given values: </p><p></p><p>2 x 3.14 x 2.5 x 5 + 2 x 3.14 x 2.5^2 = 94.25 </p><p></p><p>So the amount of tin needed to make the milk tin can is 94.25 square centimeters. </p><p></p><p>6. To find the surface area of each prism, we need to find the area of each face and add them up. </p><p></p><p>For the first prism: </p><p></p><p>- The area of the top and bottom faces (which are the same) is length x width = 3 x 4 = 12 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the front and back faces (which are the same) is length x height = 3 x 5 = 15 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the two side faces (which are the same) is width x height = 4 x 5 = 20 square meters. </p><p></p><p>So the total surface area is: </p><p></p><p>12 + 12 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 20 = 94 square meters </p><p></p><p>For the second prism: </p><p></p><p>- The area of the top and bottom faces (which are the same) is length x width = 11 x 9 = 99 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the front and back faces (which are the same) is length x height = 11 x 5 = 55 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the two side faces (which are the same) is width x height = 9 x 5 = 45 square meters. </p><p></p><p>So the total surface area is: </p><p></p><p>99 + 99 + 55 + 55 + 45 + 45 = 398 square meters </p><p></p><p>For the third prism: </p><p></p><p>- The area of the top and bottom faces (which are the same) is length x width = 24 x 50 = 1200 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the front and back faces (which are the same) is length x height = 24 x 26 = 624 square meters. </p><p>- The area of the two side faces (which are the same) is width x height = 50 x 26 = 1300 square meters. </p><p></p><p>So the total surface area is: </p><p></p><p>1200 + 1200 + 624 + 624 + 1300 + 1300 = 6248 square meters.</p><br />
