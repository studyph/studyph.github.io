quotation that is related to Mathematics.
“Mathematics in life: Life is a multiplication of love, a division of
blessings, an addition of happiness and a subtraction of sorrow”. If
you follow this saying then you will live a happy life.
Now I will ask you these questions:
1. If you fail in a subject, would it be an/a increase or decrease of
happiness?
2. You win first prize in a Math quiz and you give money to your classmates.
What you do mean by that? You divide or multiply your blessings.

"To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

                                            Reading: TEN RULES FOR FINDING LOVE AND CREATING LONG- LASTING AUTHENTIC RELATIONSHIPS 1. YOU MUST LOVE YOURSELF FIRST Your relationship with yourself is the central template from which all others are formed. Loving yourself is a prerequisite to creating a successful and authentic union with another. 2. PARTNERING IS A CHOICE MUST NURTURE THE RELATIONSHIP FOR IT TO THRIVE The choice to be in a relationship is up to you. You have the ability to attract your beloved and cause the relationship you desire to happen. 3. CREATING LOVE IS A PROCESS Moving from "I" to "we" requires a shift in perspective and energy. Being an authentic couple is an evolution. 4. RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW Your relationship will serve as an unofficial "lifeshop" in which you will learn about yourself and how you can grow on your personal path. 5. COMMUNICATION IS ESSENTIAL The open exchange of thoughts and feelings is the lifeblood of your relationship. 6. NEGOTIATION WILL BE REQUIRED There will be times when you and your partner must work through impasses. If you do this consciously and with respect, you will learn to create win-win outcomes. 7. YOUR RELATIONSHIP WILL BE CHALLENGED BY CHANGE Life will present turns in the road. How you maneuver those twists and turns determines the success of your relationship. 8. YOU MUST NURTURE THE RELATIONSHIP FOR IT TO THRIVE Treasure your beloved and your relationship will flourish. 9. RENEWAL IS THE KEY TO LONGEVITY Happily ever after means the ability to keep the relationship fresh and vital. 10. YOU WILL FORGET ALL THIS THE MOMENT YOU FALL IN LOVE You know all these rules inherently. The challenge is to remember them when you fall under the enchanting spell of love.

BALLAD OF A MOTHER'S HEART BY JOSE LA VILLA TIERRAThe night was dark,For the moon was young,And the Stars were asleep and rare,The clouds were thick,Yet Youth went out,To see his Maiden fair.Dear one,he pleaded as he knelt before her feet in tears.My love is true,Why you have kept me waiting all this years?The maiden looked at him.Unmoved it seemed,And whispered low.Persistent Youth,You have to prove by deeds,Your love is true."There's not a thingI would not do for you, Beloved" said he."Then, go." said she. "To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1. In the first stanza, what kind of night is being described?2. The boy professed, “there’s not a thing i would not do for you, beloved.” Will you do the same for the one you love?3. The girl asked her suitor “ go to your mother dear and bring her heart to me.” Based on the statement above, what does the girl really mean?4. If you were the young lover in the poem, would you do the same act of killing your own mother for your own happiness?5. Can you remember a perosnal experience signifying the love that your mother has for you?6. In your own perspective, what do you think is the message of the poem?#respect#carryonlearning</h2><br />

It is possible that she intends to gain the <strong>support</strong> of the suitor for both her and her lover.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>No, I won't. </strong>Not blaming others for your sadness is a personal responsibility.
