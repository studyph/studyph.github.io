                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

It is characterized by the gradual rise in global temperatures, sea level rise, melting of glaciers, and extreme weather events. Climate change poses a significant threat to the global ecosystem, human health, and economies. For this reason, climate change has become a critical topic of research across various fields, including environmental studies, economics, engineering, and public policy.</p><p></p><p>Despite the extensive research on climate change, there is still much to understand about the dynamics of this phenomenon, particularly from a local perspective. This study aims to address this gap in knowledge by examining the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in rural areas of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines, a developing country located in Southeast Asia, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to its geographical location, topography, and dependence on agriculture as a means of livelihood. Like many developing countries, the Philippines faces climate-related challenges such as erratic rainfall, droughts, and intense typhoons, which have a significant impact on agricultural production.</p><p></p><p>This study seeks to test the hypothesis that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the Philippines. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will collect data from farmers and agricultural experts in the rural areas of the Philippines to measure the impact of climate change on crop yields, land productivity, and farmers’ incomes.</p><p></p><p>Through this study, we hope to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity, particularly in developing country contexts. The findings of this study will inform policymakers and make recommendations aimed at mitigating the negative effects of climate change on agriculture in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>If correct mark me as brainiest nalang </p><br />

Background of study
BACKGROUND OF STUDY
This study focuses on Students preferred program for Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand students at Philippine College of Criminology. Researchers used survey questionnaires to acquire information regarding the implications of the factors that influence the choice courses. The questionnaire made it simple to gather ideas.
HYPHOTHESIS
Socioeconomic status must be taken into account as it directs us toward the right careers and educational paths. Our socioeconomic situation will also enable us to understand the requirements for a given profession. For instance, pursuing a job in the medical field might be beneficial in the long run given the high demand in that field.
SCOPE AND DELIMITATION 
60% of the students we survey chose that their preferred course was BS CRIM and 40% Of the survey chose different courses. The expectation this first semester of the 2022-2023 school year is that there are more programs to come to open their minds in what course do they want to choose.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The influence of family, specifically parents, on the career decisions of their children, and how gender and socioeconomic status influence this choice, has been examined. Research was carried out using data obtained from a questionnaire administered to students who took the university entrance examination Philippine college of criminology.

                            18. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The act of recycling has become an essential aspect of environmental conservation. Over the years, significant amounts of waste produced from households and industries have had severe implications on the environment. To combat this issue, numerous governments and organizations have implemented recycling programs that help reduce the effects of waste on the environment. However, due to the rapidly growing population and the constantly changing waste composition, several problems have been encountered in the recycling process. </p><p></p><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the challenges faced by the recycling industry in efficiently managing waste within the urban areas. The study will examine the factors that affect the recycling process, including collection, sorting, transportation, and disposal of waste. Additionally, this study aims to identify possible solutions to improve waste management and enhance the effectiveness of the recycling process. </p><p></p><p>To achieve this objective, we will first review the current literature discussing the recycling process and the challenges faced in managing waste. We will analyze different approaches and methods used by various governments and organizations in implementing recycling programs. Additionally, we will identify gaps in the current literature regarding waste management and propose ways in which our research can address these gaps. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this study proposes a theoretical framework that will guide our research. The framework is based on the principles of the Circular Economy, where waste is viewed as a valuable resource rather than a nuisance. We hypothesize that the adoption of circular economy principles can contribute to the efficient management of waste, resulting in more effective recycling processes. </p><p></p><p>The research methods will involve data collection through surveys, interviews, and site visits to observe the current waste management practices. A quantitative approach will be employed to analyze the collected data, and the results will contribute to the development of recommendations for improving waste management practices.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, this study seeks to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by addressing the gaps in waste management, proposing suitable solutions that can improve the recycling process. By adopting circular economy principles, we hope to provide insight into a more sustainable and efficient method of waste management.</p><p></p><p><strong>Feedback</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>If my answer is Correct and you like it, make me as brainiest </p><br />
