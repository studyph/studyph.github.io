Label the focus, and the epicenter of an earthquake. kground Concept: mic waves are formed from the focus due to vibrations of these tectonic materials neath the Earth's surface. The two main types of waves are body waves and surface s. Body waves can travel through the Earth's inner layers, but surface waves can only along the surface of the planet like ripples on water.

The epicenter is the point on the Earth's surface directly above the focus</p><p></p><p>3. Magnitude is related to the amount of seismic energy released at the hypocenter of the earthquake.
