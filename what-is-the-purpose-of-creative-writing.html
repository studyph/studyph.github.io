                                            Weary and distraught, the women listened to the storm as it raged around the houses. The wind screamed and howled. It drove suddenly against the doors with heavy lurching. It tore at the straw ropes that anchored the thatched roofs to the ground. It rattled and shook the small windows. It sent the rain in narrow streams under the door, through the piled-up sacks, to form large puddles on the hard, stamped, earthen floors.

                                            What's In In your previous lesson, you learned that emotive language refers to word choices that are actually designed to stir up emotional responses. Its main purpose is to convince the reader or listener to share the writer or speaker's point of view using language that stimulates an emotional reaction. We often encounter these words in public speaking, creative writing, fictional and non-fictional writing and even on daily conversations. Most of these words are adjectives, verbs and adverbs. For example, the words irritated, amused and strongly denote strong impact if used in sentences. With this learning, you are now ready to discover new concepts and skills that would enable you to explain, interpret and relate visual and verbal relationships illustrated in tables, graphs and information maps found in expository texts.​</a>
