                                            An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2. How these supported?3. What evidences are used to support these claims?

                                            Animal/fish raising in your own locality or community:1. Business permit A permit that allows you to raise animal/fish in your locality. This permits can be secured from the Local Government Unit (LGU). 2. Planning for operations The outline of the day operations of your own farm or "what gets done and who does it?" (production cycle) 3. Marketing plan "What do you do to your products once these become available." 4. Financial plan This includes budget allotment like expenses for food, medicines, vaccines and materials for their pens or house area where they could stay away of disease and other infections bacteria that could might lead them into mortality. 5. Monitoring It is important to keep records to assess whether your farm business yields income or not. 6. Research and development It is best to keep learning and take in new ideas and practices that can help improve your daily operations.  The internet is a good source of free information.  Taking Care of the Environment in Raising Animals It is important to take care of the environment when raising animals.  Some laws regulate the use of a place for animal raising.  Laws prohibit the use of residential areas for large-scale animal raising.  There is a need to segregate waste.  A definite place should be allotted for dumping the waste. Be sure that this waste does not pollute the surrounding area specially lakes, ponds, and rivers.  Animals should stay in their own fence and they are not allowed to loiter. Answer the following questions: 1. What are the materials needed to start an animal raising project? 2. What are the feasibility studies of the above mention on how to start an animal or fish raising? 3. How do you take care the environment in raising animals?​</a>

                            2. An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2.
