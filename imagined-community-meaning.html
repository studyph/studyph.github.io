Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
them within their imagined community.

Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
