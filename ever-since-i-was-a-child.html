This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

The Secret Garden
 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

                                            .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</a>

This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</h2><br />

                            9. Story
 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

The Secret Garden
 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

                            12. .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</h2><br />
