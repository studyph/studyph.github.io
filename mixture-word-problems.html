Native vegetation can be planted alongside mountains and streams that enter estuaries and along estuary margins to help erosion and trap sediment and nutrient run-off into the estuary.______3. Rather than using harsh chemicals to get rid of pests in your garden and home. use natural pesticide mixtures.______4. Bikes lead to air pollution that increase the amount of nitrogen in the air. High levels of nitrogen can produce algae bombs in estuaries that deplete the water of oxygen and make it cloudy. Which is unhealthy for the animals living there.______5. Help to keep the estuary healthy by not adding solid waste or liquid pollution deposit waste from disinfectants, beauty products, auto fluids, medicine, paint and lawn care products at your local household hazardous waste facility. Any substance that goes down your drain will eventually flow into the body of water, which affects all the marine life in that bodyof water​</a>

Then, choose words that tell about the place and time of the actions she did.Dear Diary, I had an exciting day. I went to school early because I had an examination in our math subject. I hoped that I answered the math problems right. During recess, I accompanied my bestfriend Leah in the canteen. We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role. It was funny because I had to make my voice sound like that of an old woman's. My Monday was really great.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Number problems:</p><p>Example: The sum of two numbers is 15. If one of the numbers is 6 more than the other, what are the two numbers?</p><p></p><p>Let x be the smaller number, then the larger number is x + 6.</p><p>The sum of the two numbers is 15, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 6) = 15</p><p>Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 6 = 15</p><p>Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get: 2x = 9</p><p>Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 4.5</p><p>Therefore, the two numbers are 4.5 and 10.5.</p><p></p><p>Age problems:</p><p>Example: The sum of the ages of a father and his son is 50. If the father is 3 times as old as his son, how old is each?</p><p></p><p>Let x be the age of the son, then the age of the father is 3x.</p><p>The sum of their ages is 50, so we can write an equation: x + 3x = 50</p><p>Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x = 50</p><p>Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 12.5</p><p>Therefore, the son is 12.5 years old and the father is 3 times as old, or 37.5 years old.</p><p></p><p>Rate problems:</p><p>Example: A car travels 300 miles in 5 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?</p><p></p><p>Let x be the average speed of the car in miles per hour.</p><p>We know that distance = rate x time, so we can write an equation: 300 = x * 5</p><p>Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 60</p><p>Therefore, the average speed of the car is 60 miles per hour.</p><p></p><p>Mixture problems:</p><p>Example: A chemist has a solution that is 20% acid. How many liters of pure acid must be added to 5 liters of the solution to obtain a solution that is 40% acid?</p><p></p><p>Let x be the number of liters of pure acid to be added.</p><p>The amount of acid in the original 5 liters of solution is 0.2 * 5 = 1 liter.</p><p>After adding x liters of pure acid, the total amount of solution will be 5 + x liters.</p><p>The amount of acid in the final solution is (1 + x) liters.</p><p>The concentration of acid in the final solution is 40%, so we can write an equation: (1 + x)/(5 + x) = 0.4</p><p>Multiplying both sides by (5 + x), we get: 1 + x = 2 + 0.4x</p><p>Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.6x = 1</p><p>Dividing both sides by 0.6, we get: x = 1.67</p><p>Therefore, 1.67 liters of pure acid must be added to 5 liters of the solution to obtain a solution that is 40% acid.</p><br />

High levels of nitrogen can produce algae bombs in estuaries that deplete the water of oxygen and make it cloudy. Which is unhealthy for the animals living there.______5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Mixture problems involve creating a mixture from two or more things, and then determining some quantity (percentage, price, etc) of the resulting mixture. For instance:<p></p>Your school is holding a "family friendly" event this weekend. Students have been pre-selling tickets to the event; adult tickets are $5.00, and child tickets (for kids six years old and under) are $2.50. From past experience, you expect about 13,000 people to attend the event. But this is the first year in which tickets prices have been reduced for the younger children, so you really don't know how many child tickets and how many adult tickets you can expect to sell. Your boss wants you to estimate the expected ticket revenue. You decide to use the information from the pre-sold tickets to estimate the ratio of adults to children, and figure the expected revenue from this information.Bigbucks University Presents!<p></p>You consult with your student ticket-sellers, and discover that they have not been keeping track of how many child tickets they have sold. The tickets are identical, until the ticket-seller punches a hole in the ticket, indicating that it is a child ticket. But they don't remember how many holes they've punched. They only know that they've sold 548 tickets for $2460. How much revenue from each of child and adult tickets can you expect?<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p>Let A stand for the number of adult tickets pre-sold, and C stand for the child tickets pre-sold. Then A + C = 548. Also, since each adult ticket cost $5.00, then ($5.00)A stands for the revenue brought in from the adult tickets pre-sold; likewise, ($2.50)C stands for the revenue brought in from the child tickets. Then the total income so far is given by ($5.00)A + ($2.50)C = $2460. But we can only solve an equation with one variable, not two. So look again at that first equation. If A + C = 548, then A = 548 – C (or C = 548 – A; it doesn't matter which variable you solve for). Organizing this information in a grid, we get:<br />

I went to school early because I had an examination in our math subject. I hoped that I answered the math problems right. During recess, I accompanied my bestfriend Leah in the canteen. We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role. It was funny because I had to make my voice sound like that of an old woman's. My Monday was really great. Love, CarlaWords that tell time123456Words that tell place123456</h2><br />
