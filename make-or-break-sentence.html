                        <p>There are several factors that can make or break a group, including:</p><p></p><p>1. Clear and shared goals: For a group to be successful, all members must agree on a clear and specific goal. Without a shared goal, members may work towards different objectives, causing confusion and conflict.</p><p></p><p>2. Effective communication: Communication is crucial for a group to function. Members should feel comfortable expressing their ideas, and there should be open and honest communication among all members.</p><p></p><p>3. Trust and respect: Trust and respect among group members are essential for the success of the group. Members must feel that their opinions and contributions are valued, and that they can rely on their fellow members to follow through on their commitments.</p><p></p><p>4. Diversity of skills and perspectives: A group with members who bring a variety of skills and perspectives can be more effective than a group with similar members. Different perspectives can lead to innovative solutions and approaches.</p><p></p><p>5. Leadership: Strong leadership can make or break a group. A leader should be able to motivate and inspire members, manage conflicts, and keep the group focused on its goals.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, factors that can break a group include:</p><p></p><p>1. Lack of commitment: If members are not committed to the group's goals, they may not contribute fully, leading to a lack of progress.</p><p></p><p>2. Conflict: Conflict is normal in a group, but if it is not managed effectively, it can lead to the breakdown of the group.</p><p></p><p>3. Poor communication: If members are not communicating effectively, misunderstandings can arise, leading to confusion and frustration.</p><p></p><p>4. Lack of trust and respect: If members do not trust or respect each other, it can lead to a lack of cooperation and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>5. Dominant personalities: A dominant personality can take over a group, causing other members to feel marginalized or unimportant. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and collaboration.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When someone breaks a promise to me, I will figure out why before determining consequences and I Resolve the Promise. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Handle Yourself First<p><strong>When a promise isn’t kept, especially by </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>, you probably feel angry at being let down, frustrated if you were counting on the results of the promise, irritated at yourself for believing your </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and sad because trust was broken and the relationship was harmed</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> Take a few moments to calm yourself and perform self-care, such as deep breathing, exercising to burn off the adrenaline rush or counting to 100 to reduce the temptation to berate </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>. This will give you the calmness and clarity needed to discuss the problem rationally with </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Get the Story<p><strong>Give your </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> the benefit of the doubt, suggests the Southam Consulting team in “The Ten Secrets to Managing Broken Promises, Violated Expectations, and Bad Behavior.” State the facts as you see them, such as “The paper you promised to help me with is still unfinished," or "You promised you'd come to my dance recital." Give </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> a chance to explain why the promise wasn’t kept. Listen carefully and allow the story to unfold. There could be a logical reason for the broken promise.</strong></p><p></p>Explore the Consequences<p><strong>They</strong><strong> might not understand the consequences of the broken promise</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>State your feelings, using "I" language. For example, you could say “I feel like I’m not important to you.” Ask why </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> made the promise initially, so you understand her motivation -- </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>/</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> might have meant it at the time because she</strong><strong>/</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> wanted you to feel better, but forgot to follow through because your emotions improved. Let </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> know that broken trust makes it difficult to trust in the future. If you will incur a penalty for the broken promise, such as a poor grade on a project or a missed opportunity for benefit, add that to your consequence explanation.</strong></p><p></p>Resolve the Promise<p><strong>Find out how </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> intends to resolve the issue. </strong><strong> Explain that you would prefer not to receive promises if they won’t be kept because the breach of trust will damage your relationship.</strong></p><br />

As a student who have finished doing and passed already the activities, tasks, and homeworks given by their teachers, they can relax and enjoy their short school break. They can have their own time enjoying doing the things for themselves and for their family. They can watch, play, and do some stuffs in their home. But for the students who haven't finished their activities, tasks, and homeworks, it is the time for them to be more productive and responsible to do and finished the things they need to accomplished. We have the time for ourselves to relax our mind and our body in a hectic grading period. We have our short time to be responsible in doing things for our own lives. So be more productive and useful in choosing what you're going to do in this short vacation, and always remember, be productive in a way that you can also enjoy and relax doing the things you want to do. </p><p></p><br />
