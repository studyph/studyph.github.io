                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Culture and society play a significant role in shaping our language development. Children learn language through social interaction and exposure to the language used in their environment. The language spoken in a culture reflects the values, beliefs, and customs of that society. As a result, language is intimately tied to cultural identity, and cultural differences often manifest themselves through variations in language use. For example, some cultures may place greater emphasis on politeness and formality in language, while others may value directness and brevity. Similarly, the use of idioms, slang, and other informal language may be more common in some cultures than others. Ultimately, our language development is shaped by the linguistic and cultural environment in which we grow up.</p><p></p><p>2.Languages are constantly changing and evolving over time. This is due to various factors such as cultural influences, technological advancements, migration, and globalization. One way that languages change is through the borrowing of words from other languages. For example, English has borrowed many words from French, Latin, and Greek. Languages also change through the creation of new words and expressions, often in response to new technological or social developments. In addition, languages can also evolve through grammatical changes, such as the simplification of complex grammar rules or the adoption of new grammatical structures. These changes can occur gradually over time, or they may be more sudden and dramatic, such as the emergence of new dialects or creole languages.</p><p></p><p>3.Language and identity share some commonalities, but they are not identical. Both language and identity are shaped by culture and society, and they are intertwined with one another. However, language is just one aspect of identity, alongside other factors such as ethnicity, nationality, religion, and social class. While language can be a powerful marker of identity, it is not the only factor that determines a person's sense of self. Similarly, not all aspects of language are directly related to identity - for example, grammar and syntax are more related to the mechanics of language use than to identity. Overall, the relationship between language and identity is complex and multifaceted, and it can vary depending on the individual and the cultural context.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ps: yung sagot sa number 3 yan na yan,ilagay mo na lang sa Venn Diagram</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture of the Philippines is characterized by cultural diversity. Although the multiple ethnic groups of the Philippine archipelago have only recently established a shared Filipino national identity, their cultures were all shaped by the geography and history of the region, and by centuries of interaction with neighboring cultures, and colonial powers.

                            28. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />

It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />
