2.The first component of the vocal apparatus which can also be described as “power
source”.
3.The second component of the vocal apparatus which is responsible in making sound.
4.Generally composed of the pharyngeal cavity, it alters the sounds issuing from your
vocal cords, amplifying some frequencies while attenuating others.
5.Changing the notes from lower to higher.
6.A matched pair of pearly white muscles and ligaments, that is responsible for creating sound, we know of as human voice.
7.Composed of the soft palate, tongue, teeth, lips, and other parts of the mouth, it

                                            DISCUSSION:A 33-year-old pregnant woman, whose last menstrual period was July 9, 2019,experienced her early pregnancy smoothly. Before January 23, 2020, she wasdoing fine and was in normal condition. Her colleague's father was hospitalizeddue to confirmed coronavirus pneumonia at the end of December 2019, and thecolleague developed fever symptoms after taking care of his father in thehospital and was later confirmed with the sever acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactionfrom throat swab. The pregnant woman with 28 + 5 weeks gestation developedcough and expectoration on January 26, 2020, and then had a fever on January27 with her body temperature fluctuating between 37.5°C and 37.8°C. She wasdiagnosed with common pneumonia and treated by oral cephalosporin at acommunity hospital for 3 days. Her pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scanon January 30, 2020 (29 + 2 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) showed scatteredconsolidation and ground-glass shadow of both lungs and the blood routine testresults showed that her white blood cell count was 8.15 x 109/L, neutrophil ratiowas 78.6%, lymphocyte count was 1.08 x109/L, lymphocyte ratio was 13.3%, C-reactive protein was 99.67 mg/L, and hemoglobin was 115 g/L: At the same time,she was tested negative for influenza A and B virus antigens, Mycoplasmapneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Based on the criteria of COVID-19pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Program (5th edition)released by the National Health Commission of China on February 3, 2020,[8] shewas diagnosed as a clinically confirmed case, so quarantine treatmentcombined with nebulized inhalation and oral cephalosporin was applied for her.Five days later (30 weeks gestation), her body temperature returned to normaland the symptoms such as cough and expectoration disappeared. Subsequently,the pharyngeal swab test of SARS-COV-2 revealed twice negative at acommunity hospital on March 5 and March 7, 2020 (34 + 4 weeks gestation). Thepulmonary CT scan on March 24, 2020 (37 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) revealed thatmost of the lung lesions were absorbed. On April 5, 2020 (38 + 5 weeks gestation),the pulmonary CT scan revealed further absorption of the lung lesions (Fig. 1), and:: ادا​ </a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The pharynx (plural: pharynges) is the part of the throat behind the mouth and nasal cavity, and above the oesophagus and trachea – the tubes going down to the stomach and the lungs. It is found in vertebrates and invertebrates, though its structure varies across species. The pharynx carries food and air to the esophagus and larynx. The flap of cartilage called the epiglottis stops food from entering the larynx.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Its a group of muscles that form the pharynx, which is posterior to the otal cavity, determining the shape of lumen, and affecting its sound properties as primary resonating cavity.</p><br />

                            17. DISCUSSION:A 33-year-old pregnant woman, whose last menstrual period was July 9, 2019,experienced her early pregnancy smoothly. Before January 23, 2020, she wasdoing fine and was in normal condition. Her colleague's father was hospitalizeddue to confirmed coronavirus pneumonia at the end of December 2019, and thecolleague developed fever symptoms after taking care of his father in thehospital and was later confirmed with the sever acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactionfrom throat swab. The pregnant woman with 28 + 5 weeks gestation developedcough and expectoration on January 26, 2020, and then had a fever on January27 with her body temperature fluctuating between 37.5°C and 37.8°C. She wasdiagnosed with common pneumonia and treated by oral cephalosporin at acommunity hospital for 3 days. Her pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scanon January 30, 2020 (29 + 2 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) showed scatteredconsolidation and ground-glass shadow of both lungs and the blood routine testresults showed that her white blood cell count was 8.15 x 109/L, neutrophil ratiowas 78.6%, lymphocyte count was 1.08 x109/L, lymphocyte ratio was 13.3%, C-reactive protein was 99.67 mg/L, and hemoglobin was 115 g/L: At the same time,she was tested negative for influenza A and B virus antigens, Mycoplasmapneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Based on the criteria of COVID-19pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Program (5th edition)released by the National Health Commission of China on February 3, 2020,[8] shewas diagnosed as a clinically confirmed case, so quarantine treatmentcombined with nebulized inhalation and oral cephalosporin was applied for her.Five days later (30 weeks gestation), her body temperature returned to normaland the symptoms such as cough and expectoration disappeared. Subsequently,the pharyngeal swab test of SARS-COV-2 revealed twice negative at acommunity hospital on March 5 and March 7, 2020 (34 + 4 weeks gestation). Thepulmonary CT scan on March 24, 2020 (37 weeks gestation) (Fig. 1) revealed thatmost of the lung lesions were absorbed. On April 5, 2020 (38 + 5 weeks gestation),the pulmonary CT scan revealed further absorption of the lung lesions (Fig. 1), and:: ادا​ </h2><br />

                        In the embryonic development of vertebrates, pharyngeal pouches form on the endodermal side between thepharyngeal arches. The pharyngealgrooves (or clefts) form the lateral ectodermal surface of the neck region to separate the arches. The pouchesline up with the clefts, and these thin segments become gills in fish.<br />

This field of study enables scientists to analyze the anatomy of various organisms and detect similarities and differences, which can reveal insights into their evolutionary history and relationships.</p><p></p><p>6.) Body parts that perform a similar function but differ in structure are known as analogous structures.

Natural selection is an evolutionary mechanism in which individuals with beneficial characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those characteristics on to their offspring.
