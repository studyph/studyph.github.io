A time off from public spaces allows the environment to heal itself. 6. All countries who successfully contained the virus implemented a lockdown. Evidences: 1. At least 7.3 million Filipinos lost their jobs because of the pandemic based on the record of the Philippine Statistics Authority. 2. According to a study by the University of the Philippines, there is an 83 percent decrease in Covid-19 cases during the implementation of the lockdown. 3. Philippine National Police record shows that crime rate dropped to 55 percent during the lockdown period. 4. The ozone layer was reported to have recovered, and Manila Bay is a lot cleaner now. 5. Former health secretary and dean of Ateneo School of Medicine Manuel Dayrit said, “Not imposing community quarantine will risk a Wuhan-like situation.” 6.

                                            Thesis: In times of a pandemic, and in a place where discipline is not part of every citizen's vocabulary, a lockdown is still the Philippine's best option to keep the coronavirus disease under control ARGUMENTS: 1. Limiting the movement of people in public spaces minimizes the spread of the virus. 2. A lockdown compels the leaders to prove their worth in extending public service. 3. Staying at home allows for a much needed bonding time among family members.4. Imposing curfews and window hours help ensure public order and safety among residents.5. A time off from public spaces allows the environment to heal itself. 6. All countries who successfully contained the virus implemented a lockdown. EVIDENCES: 1. At least 7.3 million Filipinos lost their jobs because of the pandemic based on the record of the Philippine Statistics Authority 2. According to a study by the University of the Philippines, there is an 83 percent decrease in Covid-19 cases during the implementation of the lockdown. 3. Philippine National Police record shows that crime rate dropped to 55 percent during the lockdown period. 4. The ozone layer was reported to have recovered, and Manila Bay is a lot cleaner now. 5. Former health secretary and dean of Ateneo School of Medicine Manuel Dayrit said, “Not imposing community quarantine will risk a Wuhan-like situation." 6. In March alone, over 17,000 lockdown violators were arrested.​</a>

The month of June every year is usually the time when millions of Filipino students troop back to their schools and learn. 2. The UN report added that the “closures of schools and other learning spaces have impacted 94 per cent of the world’s student population, up to 99 percent in low and lower-middle-income countries. 3. Studies have suggested that missing even just one year of school translates to lost years’ worth of academic gains 4. A World Bank study has estimated that every additional year of schooling has a corresponding return of 8-10 percent of a student’s future income. 5. But I also think that while formal schooling is very important, we should not underestimate the value of non-formal learning. 6. I will repeat, formal schooling is very crucial, but learning should not be limited to face-to-face school environment. 7. Our home, with our parents, is our first school. 8. I am saying that both can complement each other. 9. I think this is the perfect time to instill the entrepreneurial spirit in our kids. 10. This pandemic will give us, in fact force us, to confront the importance of parents, of our homes in making sure that this will not be a “lost generation” but a generation of entrepreneurs, hardworking, and passionate to provide solutions to the problems of their community. ​</a>

According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), teenage pregnancy has a huge rate in the Philippines, especially among the poor. 2/3 of Filipinos, who give birth before age 20, belongs to the low class society. Data from the National Statistics Office showed that 8 percent among 1.7 million babies born in 2004 were born to mothers 15-19 years old. Young mother gave birth to 818,000 babies in 2000 alone. This means, almost one of every 10 babies is born to teenage mothers. The risk is, almost 10 percent of the born babies from young mothers are malnourished. As years passed by, the statistics are getting higher. According to the study done by the Population Institute of the University of the Philippines, more than 46 percent of teenage pregnant woman resort to induced abortion which is against the law and the Church; 2 of every 5 teenage pregnancies are unwanted ones. If the government won't start acting on this, this problem will be worse as years go by. Type of Issue Social What problems are observed in the community? 1. 2. 3. 4. Economic 5. 6.

                            23. Thesis: In times of a pandemic, and in a place where discipline is not part of every citizen's vocabulary, a lockdown is still the Philippine's best option to keep the coronavirus disease under control ARGUMENTS: 1. Limiting the movement of people in public spaces minimizes the spread of the virus. 2. A lockdown compels the leaders to prove their worth in extending public service. 3.

At least 7.3 million Filipinos lost their jobs because of the pandemic based on the record of the Philippine Statistics Authority 2. According to a study by the University of the Philippines, there is an 83 percent decrease in Covid-19 cases during the implementation of the lockdown. 3. Philippine National Police record shows that crime rate dropped to 55 percent during the lockdown period. 4. The ozone layer was reported to have recovered, and Manila Bay is a lot cleaner now. 5.

                            25. Read the selection and identify if the underline statements are opinion or assertion. Write “O” if it is an opinion and “A” if assertion. 1. The month of June every year is usually the time when millions of Filipino students troop back to their schools and learn. 2. The UN report added that the “closures of schools and other learning spaces have impacted 94 per cent of the world’s student population, up to 99 percent in low and lower-middle-income countries. 3. Studies have suggested that missing even just one year of school translates to lost years’ worth of academic gains 4. A World Bank study has estimated that every additional year of schooling has a corresponding return of 8-10 percent of a student’s future income. 5. But I also think that while formal schooling is very important, we should not underestimate the value of non-formal learning. 6. I will repeat, formal schooling is very crucial, but learning should not be limited to face-to-face school environment. 7. Our home, with our parents, is our first school. 8. I am saying that both can complement each other. 9. I think this is the perfect time to instill the entrepreneurial spirit in our kids. 10. This pandemic will give us, in fact force us, to confront the importance of parents, of our homes in making sure that this will not be a “lost generation” but a generation of entrepreneurs, hardworking, and passionate to provide solutions to the problems of their community. ​</h2><br />

Write the various problems observed in the text, identify the type of issue and give some suggestions in solving the problems. Copy the chart and write your answers in a separate sheet. According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), teenage pregnancy has a huge rate in the Philippines, especially among the poor. 2/3 of Filipinos, who give birth before age 20, belongs to the low class society. Data from the National Statistics Office showed that 8 percent among 1.7 million babies born in 2004 were born to mothers 15-19 years old. Young mother gave birth to 818,000 babies in 2000 alone. This means, almost one of every 10 babies is born to teenage mothers. The risk is, almost 10 percent of the born babies from young mothers are malnourished. As years passed by, the statistics are getting higher. According to the study done by the Population Institute of the University of the Philippines, more than 46 percent of teenage pregnant woman resort to induced abortion which is against the law and the Church; 2 of every 5 teenage pregnancies are unwanted ones. If the government won't start acting on this, this problem will be worse as years go by. Type of Issue Social What problems are observed in the community? 1. 2. 3. 4. Economic 5. 6.
