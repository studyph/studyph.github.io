                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Marxism is a social, political, and economic philosophy named after Karl Marx. It examines the effect of capitalism on labor, productivity, and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to overturn capitalism in favor of communism. Marxism posits that the struggle between social classes—specifically between the bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or workers—defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and will inevitably lead to revolutionary communism.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Marxists theorize that inequality and poverty are functional com- ponents of the capitalist mode of production: capitalism necessarily produces in- egalitarian social structures. Inequality is transferred from one generation to an- other through the environment of services and opportunities which surrounds each.</p><br />
