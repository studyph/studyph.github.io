                                            ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.

Assume that you’re the staffing manager in an organization that informally, but strongly, discourages you and other managers from hiring people with disabilities. The organization’s rationale is that people with disabilities are unlikely to be high performers or long-term employees and are costly to train, insure, and integrate into the work unit. What is your ethical assessment of the organization’s stance? Do you have any ethical obligations to try to change the stance, and if so, how might you go about that?
2. Assume the organization you work for strictly adheres to the law in its relationships with employees and job applicants. The organization calls it “staffing by the book.” But beyond that, it seems anything goes in terms of tolerated staffing practices. What is your assessment of this approach?</a>

                            9. ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.

                        <p><strong>POSTER</strong> OF EXPRESSING <strong>THE ATTRACTION LOVE</strong></p><p>Theme: <strong>Protecting Love</strong> and <strong>Relationship</strong></p><p>From <strong>the poster</strong> below, here is the explanation:</p><p>When motivated by <strong>love</strong>, <strong>protecting</strong> includes keeping the loved one safe from outside threats, internal threats, and accidents.</p><p>From the time a kid is born, adults know that <strong>protection</strong> is a real show of <strong>love</strong>. They wished to shield the kid from external and internal threats (another vehicle and the sun, respectively) (insufficient stimulation). Their affection was manifest in their attentive demeanor, which was sensitive to her wants and responses.</p><p>Children must bear increasing responsibility for their well-being as they mature. Nevertheless, <strong>protection</strong> is still required in adulthood. As long as they recognize that their actions and worries are motivated by a desire to aid rather than to interfere, criticize, or "know better," it is possible to build a sense of safety and partnership with those<strong> who love</strong>.</p><p>Once a person no longer qualifies as an infant, boundaries become indispensable in romantic interactions. The longer the <strong>relationship</strong> and the older the parties, the more significant these limits become. They ensure that they keep an internal compass. It is a gift of adulthood to determine when people need protection from others and when they must learn through our efforts (and sometimes mistakes). Trusting and <strong>protecting</strong> that a <strong>loved </strong>one will respect boundaries, crossing them only when invited and retreating when uninvited, enables people to keep their behavioral compass.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about posters here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/26549563</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            24. 1. Assume that you’re the staffing manager in an organization that informally, but strongly, discourages you and other managers from hiring people with disabilities. The organization’s rationale is that people with disabilities are unlikely to be high performers or long-term employees and are costly to train, insure, and integrate into the work unit. What is your ethical assessment of the organization’s stance? Do you have any ethical obligations to try to change the stance, and if so, how might you go about that?
2. Assume the organization you work for strictly adheres to the law in its relationships with employees and job applicants. The organization calls it “staffing by the book.” But beyond that, it seems anything goes in terms of tolerated staffing practices. What is your assessment of this approach?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1.</strong> As the <strong>staffing manager</strong> in an organization that discourages the hiring of people with disabilities, it is my <strong>ethical obligation</strong> to <strong>challenge</strong> and <strong>change this stance</strong>. Discriminating against individuals with disabilities is not only unethical but also illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Furthermore, this stance ignores the valuable contributions that individuals with disabilities can make to the workplace.</p><p><strong>To change the organization's stance</strong>, I would <strong>begin by educating the leadership and management team</strong> about the benefits of hiring individuals with disabilities. This could include sharing research and case studies that demonstrate the positive impact that employees with disabilities can have on the workplace, such as increased productivity and higher employee morale. I would also work to provide training and resources to managers to ensure they have the tools and knowledge necessary to effectively integrate employees with disabilities into their teams.</p><p>It may also be <strong>necessary </strong>to <strong>involve legal counsel</strong> to ensure that the organization is in compliance with the ADA and other applicable laws. This may involve reviewing current policies and practices, providing reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and ensuring that all recruitment and hiring practices are fair and non-discriminatory.</p><p><strong>Overall</strong>, it is important to take a proactive approach to challenging and changing the organization's stance on hiring individuals with disabilities. By promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, the organization can benefit from a wider range of perspectives, skills, and talents, and create a more supportive and positive work environment.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong> The <strong>approach of strictly adhering to the law while tolerating questionable staffing practices</strong> is <strong>not a sufficient or ethical approach</strong> to staffing. While it is important to comply with legal requirements, it is also essential to uphold ethical principles and promote a culture of fairness and respect in the workplace.</p><p><strong>The organization</strong> should <strong>adopt clear</strong> and <strong>transparent policies</strong> and <strong>practices that promote diversity, inclusion, and fairness</strong> in staffing decisions. This could include establishing clear guidelines for recruitment, hiring, and promotion, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications and abilities, and providing training and support to managers to ensure that they are making informed and unbiased decisions.</p><p><strong>By taking a more proactive approach to staffing</strong>, the organization can create a more positive and supportive work environment, attract and retain top talent, and ensure that all employees are treated fairly and with respect. Ultimately, this can lead to better business outcomes and a more sustainable and successful organization.</p><br />
