                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. French &amp; Russian table service:</p>Both are formal table services.French table service is characterized by the use of elaborate serving dishes and utensils, while Russian table service is known for its use of ornate table settings and formal tableware.In French table service, food is prepared and plated in the kitchen, while in Russian table service, the food is often prepared and served tableside.<p>2. American and Family-style table service:</p>Both are informal table services.American table service involves guests ordering their meals directly from a menu and having them served individually, while family-style service involves passing large platters of food around the table for guests to help themselves.American table service is often found in restaurants, while family-style service is more commonly used in casual dining settings and at home.<p>3. Buffet and Banquet service:</p>Both are often used for large events or gatherings.Buffet service allows guests to serve themselves from a selection of dishes set out on a table, while banquet service involves the serving of a pre-set menu to guests at their tables.Buffet service is typically more informal and allows guests to choose their own dishes and serving sizes, while banquet service is often more formal and structured.<p></p><br />
