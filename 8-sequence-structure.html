_____________ 1. Problem and solution compose text structures which involve two parts: the 
author identifies a problem and the author details a solution to the problem.
_____________ 2. Comparison and contrast text structure involves a comparison involving 
multiple things, revealing how they are similar and how they are different.
_____________ 3. Cause and Effect text structure is focused on an event or phenomena, the 
writer names the event/phenomena and then tells what caused it to happen
_____________ 4. Information or arguments in Sequence and Time order structure are 
sometimes constructed in a chain, so that the writer can lay out steps in a process, series of 
events, or a hierarchy.
_____________ 5. Description is the texts that explain a topic or simply describes something. 
Often the text is broken into sections, each with a main idea and details that elaborate on it.
_____________ 6. Informational and Factual Text is a fiction writing, written with the intension of 
informing the reader about a specific topic. It is typically found in magazines, science or 
history books, autobiographies, and instruction manuals. They are written using special texts 
features that allow the reader to easily find key information, and understand the main topic
_____________ 7. The purpose of Problem and Solution Text Structure is to identify problems 
and oppose solutions.
_____________ 8. The purpose of Comparison and Contrast Text Structure is to discuss ideas, 
events, or phenomena, showing only how they are similar.
_____________ 9. The purpose of Cause-and-Effect Text Structure is to provide explanations 
and reasons for Problem and Solution Text Structure.
_____________ 10. Venn diagram usually use to identify the sequence or time order text structure.</a>

                        <p> </p>1. <strong>chimpanzees</strong><p></p>Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and their extinct ancestors form a family of organisms known as the Hominidae. Researchers generally agree that among the living animals in this group, humans are most closely related to chimpanzees, judging from comparisons of anatomy and genetics.<p></p>2. <strong>Sponges</strong><p></p>Sponges or comb jellies are the sister group to all other animals, so they are the least related.3. Yes. If the amino acid sequence of two organisms are similar, then the organisms' DNA sequences would also be similar. The central dogma of biology states that DNA contains the key for RNA, which then codes for proteins. ... These codons will be important in the second phase of protein synthesis called translation.<p></p>4. These three species look alike in many ways, both in body and behavior. But for a clear understanding of how closely they are related, scientists compare their DNA, an essential molecule that's the instruction manual for building each species. Humans and chimps share a surprising 98.8 percent of their DNA.<p></p>5. According to the new genetic research—when combined with known fossils—the lineage that led to humans, chimps, and gorillas evolved from a common ancestor about 10 million years ago. Humans and chimps then popped off of that lineage some 6 million years ago, according to the new study.<br />
