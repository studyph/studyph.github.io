Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</a>

What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</h2><br />
