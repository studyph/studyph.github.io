                                            Here is another paragraph. What does this paragraph tell you? Those Majestic Mountains Dome Mountains Folded (Complex) Mountains Volcanic Mountains We are lucky to have many mountains around us. Although they may look the same, they are formed differently. How mountains are formed Fold mountains are formed when the sedimentary rock above the sea level rises due to the movement of the plates under the sea. The Himalayas is an example of this. When a large area moves vertically, leaving some places up and the others down, block mountains are formed. Volcanic mountains, like Mt. Fuji, are formed because of a volcanic activity. Lastly, dome mountains are formed when a large glob of magma rises to the surface, cools, and becomes a large dome of rock. Informational texts have certain features. These are seen in print, graphics, and the language used. They have headings or titles and subtitles that are usually set in bold print for emphasis. Look at the text, "Those Majestic Mountains" that you have just read. Can you identify the title and its subtitle? The texts can also have drawings or illustrations to help the reader understand clearly what the writers want to say. There can also be graphs, tables, or charts to be better understood. To show why the text is written, you will find clues in the words used. In the text, you could find the names of the kinds of mountains according to how they were formed. There are words that tell you the purpose of the text. Remember the selection about wildlife? Because it is also an explanatory text, you could find the phrase that is why after the explanation has been given. Write your answers to these questions about the selection, "Those Majestic Mountains," in your notebook: 1. What are the different kinds of mountains? 2. How are they classified? 3 .What do the sentences about them explain?​</a>

On June 15,1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted, which was noted as the second most powerful eruption. It is located                           at                        Zambales,                          Philippines. 2. Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions,                     and           major            eruptions                     occurring                about                every              50           years.3. Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a "critical state."4. On 10 April 1815, Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years.5. Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.6. The Bogoslof island is the exposed summit of a volcano that sits in 6,000 feet of water in the Bering Sea about 40 miles west of the Alaskan island of Unalaska, which is part of the Aleutian chain. Bogoslof has had a series of eruptions over the several weeks in December 2016, spewing gases and ash into the skies and prompting aviation warnings.​</a>

                                            Learning Task 1 Part A. Directions: Read the passage below. The Water Cycle Have you ever wondered what happens to puddles after a big rainstorm? Each bit of precipitation in our world goes through the water cycle. The water cycle is the movement of all the water on Earth. The water in, on, and above the Earth is always moving and changing states. It changes from liquid to vapor. It changes from vapor to ice, and back again. The cycle continually repeats itself. First, the sun heats up the Earth's surface and draws water into the atmosphere. This process is called evaporation This is what makes puddles disappear! The water evaporates, changing from a liquid into a gas. Then, as the water vapor rises into the sky, it cools down. It turns back into a liquid when it is in the clouds. This part of the water cycle is called condensation. After the clouds become heavy, precipitation falls. It falls as rain, snow, hail, or sleet. Sometimes precipitation can fall in heavy amounts. This can cause flooding and problems for people and animals on Earth. Mountainous areas, places that typically have snow, experience melting when the temperatures rise. The snowmelt runs down toward sea level. As the runoff reaches lower elevations, it can end up in lakes and rivers, eventually leading to the ocean. This part of the process is called collection. Water is collected in different places on the Earth. It can be absorbed back into trees and plants. It can return to lakes, rivers, and the ocean. The water can freeze into snow, ice, or glaciers, depending on the climate. The water cycle is a system in nature that is constantly moving. The steps always occur in the same order, and the cycle always repeats itself . Directions: Complete the chart with details from the text/passage that show the correct sequence of water cycle. First, Next, After that, Then, Finally, Part B. Directions. Read the definitions below and put the corresponding term in the spaces marking each part of the cycle in the diagram. Evaporation: Liquid water is heated by the sun until it rises as water vapor into the atmosphere. Precipitation: Water falling to the Earth in the form of weather - including rain, sleet, hail and snow Condensation: Water vapor molecules join together, becoming liquid, in the form of clouds. The Sun: Creates all of the weather on Earth through the uneven heating of Earth's surface. Liquid Water: All living things need this to survive and it is an important part of the weather system.​</a>

Those Majestic Mountains Dome Mountains Folded (Complex) Mountains Volcanic Mountains We are lucky to have many mountains around us. Although they may look the same, they are formed differently. How mountains are formed Fold mountains are formed when the sedimentary rock above the sea level rises due to the movement of the plates under the sea. The Himalayas is an example of this. When a large area moves vertically, leaving some places up and the others down, block mountains are formed. Volcanic mountains, like Mt. Fuji, are formed because of a volcanic activity. Lastly, dome mountains are formed when a large glob of magma rises to the surface, cools, and becomes a large dome of rock. Informational texts have certain features. These are seen in print, graphics, and the language used. They have headings or titles and subtitles that are usually set in bold print for emphasis. Look at the text, "Those Majestic Mountains" that you have just read. Can you identify the title and its subtitle?

On June 15,1991, Mt. Pinatubo erupted, which was noted as the second most powerful eruption. It is located                           at                        Zambales,                          Philippines. 2. Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand is one of the more active volcanoes in the Ring of Fire, with yearly minor eruptions,                     and           major            eruptions                     occurring                about                every              50           years.3. Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest and most famous mountain, is an active volcano in the Ring of Fire. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707, but recent earthquake activity in eastern Japan may have put the volcano in a "critical state."4. On 10 April 1815, Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years.5. Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington, is an active volcano in the Cascade Mountains. Its historic 1980 eruption lasted 9 hours and covered nearby areas in tons of volcanic ash.6. The Bogoslof island is the exposed summit of a volcano that sits in 6,000 feet of water in the Bering Sea about 40 miles west of the Alaskan island of Unalaska, which is part of the Aleutian chain. Bogoslof has had a series of eruptions over the several weeks in December 2016, spewing gases and ash into the skies and prompting aviation warnings.​</h2><br />

                            9. Learning Task 1 Part A. Directions: Read the passage below. The Water Cycle Have you ever wondered what happens to puddles after a big rainstorm? Each bit of precipitation in our world goes through the water cycle. The water cycle is the movement of all the water on Earth. The water in, on, and above the Earth is always moving and changing states. It changes from liquid to vapor. It changes from vapor to ice, and back again. The cycle continually repeats itself. First, the sun heats up the Earth's surface and draws water into the atmosphere. This process is called evaporation This is what makes puddles disappear! The water evaporates, changing from a liquid into a gas. Then, as the water vapor rises into the sky, it cools down. It turns back into a liquid when it is in the clouds. This part of the water cycle is called condensation. After the clouds become heavy, precipitation falls. It falls as rain, snow, hail, or sleet. Sometimes precipitation can fall in heavy amounts. This can cause flooding and problems for people and animals on Earth. Mountainous areas, places that typically have snow, experience melting when the temperatures rise. The snowmelt runs down toward sea level. As the runoff reaches lower elevations, it can end up in lakes and rivers, eventually leading to the ocean. This part of the process is called collection. Water is collected in different places on the Earth. It can be absorbed back into trees and plants. It can return to lakes, rivers, and the ocean. The water can freeze into snow, ice, or glaciers, depending on the climate. The water cycle is a system in nature that is constantly moving. The steps always occur in the same order, and the cycle always repeats itself . Directions: Complete the chart with details from the text/passage that show the correct sequence of water cycle. First, Next, After that, Then, Finally, Part B. Directions. Read the definitions below and put the corresponding term in the spaces marking each part of the cycle in the diagram. Evaporation: Liquid water is heated by the sun until it rises as water vapor into the atmosphere. Precipitation: Water falling to the Earth in the form of weather - including rain, sleet, hail and snow Condensation: Water vapor molecules join together, becoming liquid, in the form of clouds. The Sun: Creates all of the weather on Earth through the uneven heating of Earth's surface. Liquid Water: All living things need this to survive and it is an important part of the weather system.​</h2><br />
