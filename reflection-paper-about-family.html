                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

"Rules and policies are important in the proper and orderly functioning of a society. The legislature becomes important in this regard." How about in your family? Who creates rules? What are some of these rules? Do you think it is necessary to follow these rules? Why? The participation of citizens in matters of public concern is fundamental in any democratic system. The government recognizes the participation and the indispensable role of the youth in public and civic affairs. That means, you can communicate the Congress directly on issues that you want to raise. Remember, solutions to problems can be in the form of legislation or a law. Guide Questions: 1. What are the current issues or problems that need to be addressed? 2. How can your representative in the Congress be of help in this regard?​</a>

My remarkable community quarantine experience It was a couple of months ago when the strictest quarantine was lifted nationwide and the patience of almost every one of us was put into test. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to become productive. I worked a lot of things, specifically my paper works from my full-time job and fixed some of my personal stuff which I was able to enjoy and finish. After those tasks, I spent the rest of my time getting along with my family, we watched numerous movies together which we truly enjoyed. Well, that may be very simple as how it seemned, but for me, it was the most remarkable experience that I had during quarantine because I got an opportunity to become even bonded with my family. Write your own paragraph about your community quarantine experience and tell how the experience became remarkable for you. Criteria in marking the paragraph: Unity - 3 Organization -3 Spelling and Punctuation - 5 Use of Simple Past Tense - 4 Total - 20 (Title) 7​</a>

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges her otherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enough comparison for her family; yet, she has not left any for herself.Questions:1.

                            4. Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

                            12. Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges her otherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enough comparison for her family; yet, she has not left any for herself.Questions:1.
