Projectile motion occurs when a moving object experiences only the acceleration due to gravity which actsvertically downward.2. In projectile motion, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity affects the trajectory in a significant way.3. The speed of a projectile depends only on its height above its launch point, and not on whether it is movingupward or downward.4. The time to reach maximum height from any point is equal to the time spent returning from the maximumheight to the point.5. A projectile has 2 components: the horizontal and vertical.6. An object that is initially thrown into the air and continues to move on its path without the action of gravity is anexample of projectile motion.7. The vertical component is uniform motion while the horizontal component if free fall.8. In projectile motion, the change occurs only in the horizontal velocity.9. Victors are quantities with magnitude only.10. If air resistance is neglected, a projectile moves horizontally at increasing speed and simultaneously travelsvertically with acceleration equal to g.​</a>

This is that the Ocing The pull of gravity acts on all objects. So, when you drop something or even when you throw something up, it will go down Things thrown always follot a constant acceleration which has a magnitude of 9 8 ms. This means that the velocity of an object changes by 9.8 m/s every second of foll. Consider a boll thrown upward. As the ball goes up a decelerates until it stops momentorly and changes direction. That means, it reaches its maximum height before it starts to foll back to the point where it was thrown and its speed will be equal to the speed at which it was thrown. Note that the magnitudes of the two velocities are equal but they have opposite directions - velocity is upward when it was thrown, but downward when it retures Free fall is an example of unifomy occelerated motion, with its acceleration being -9.8 m/s negative because it is downward.

Projectile motion occurs when a moving object experiences only the acceleration due to gravity which actsvertically downward.2. In projectile motion, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity affects the trajectory in a significant way.3. The speed of a projectile depends only on its height above its launch point, and not on whether it is movingupward or downward.4. The time to reach maximum height from any point is equal to the time spent returning from the maximumheight to the point.5. A projectile has 2 components: the horizontal and vertical.6. An object that is initially thrown into the air and continues to move on its path without the action of gravity is anexample of projectile motion.7. The vertical component is uniform motion while the horizontal component if free fall.8. In projectile motion, the change occurs only in the horizontal velocity.9.

13. This term applies to an object dropped from rest, object thrown downward, and object 
thrown upward.
a. constant acceleration b. acceleration c. Air resistance d. Free fall motion14. It is also known as the Law of Inertia. An object’s momentum is also known as inertia 
in motion
A. Law of Inertia b. law of motion c. law of interaction d. impulse
15. A special name is given to the product of the force applied and the time interval

II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance
5. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same acceleration if air 
resistance is neglected.
6. In physics, an external force acting on an object over a specific time leads to a change in 
momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.
