The History of Philippine Journalism
Journalism in the Philippines has gone through a number of both setbacks and boosts. The history of Philippine journalism presented in this study is cited from “Journalism for Filipinos” by Malinao (2003). 
In the year 1637, the first Philippine Newsletter was published - the “Successos Felices” (Fortunate Events) of Tomas Pinpin, the father of Filipino printing.  Aside from Pinpin’s one-shot fling at journalism, the “Hojas Volantes” (Flying sheets) or Spaniards’ notice to the public, were widely distributed in the country for mass readership.

For two days, the protesters stood up to the military and police, refusing to be intimidated. Ultimately, their perseverance led to the overthrow of the Marcos regime. The event has had a positive impact on the lives of Filipinos, as it has helped to solidify the country's democracy and strengthen the nation's national identity.</p><p></p><p>Today, there are many challenges that young people face.
