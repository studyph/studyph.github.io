                        CLASSIFICATION OF HEAT TRANSFER<p></p><p></p>The transporting of heat take place in 3 ways: Conduction, Convection, and Radiation. <p></p><p>Heat transport happens among states of being counted every time a temperature change exists and warmth transport takes place most effectively withinside the path of lowering the temperature, which means from a hot item to a cold item.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>• CONVECTION </strong>is the term used when the HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH AIR. When a fluid is in touch with a top at a temperature special from the fluid temperature, <strong>the convection</strong> will changes warmth from the new top to the cold fluid (or from a cold top part to a hot fluid). The movement of the fluid will then switch the heat in the fluid. Continuing with the river example, conduction will arise from the warmer soil at the lowest of the riverbed to the cooler water withinside the river. Convective warmth changes between a top and fluid can't arise if there is conduction on the interface between the fluid and the top. The movement of the fluid can be absolute because of variations in density (on account of temperature variations withinside the fluid), as in natural convection.</p><p></p><p><strong>•	</strong><strong>CONDUCTION</strong><strong> </strong>is the converting of power from one molecule to some other through direct contact. This converting takes place while molecules hit every other, much like a sport of pool in which one transferring ball moves some other, inflicting the second one to move. <strong>Conduction takes vicinity in solids, liquids, and gases, however, works great in substances</strong> that have easy molecules which might be positioned near every other. For example, metallic is a higher conductor than wooden or plastic.</p><p></p><p>•<strong>	</strong><strong>RADIATION</strong> is the converting of warmth through electromagnetic waves. When you stand withinside the solar, you're warmed through the electromagnetic waves, especially infrared radiation, that travel from the solar to Earth. In addition to the solar, mild bulbs, irons, and toasters additionally,<strong> switch warmth through radiation.</strong> Note that, not like conduction or convection, warmth transfer through radiation does not require any matter to assist with the conversion.</p><p></p><p>Here are some situations:</p><p>You feel the heat from the flame without touching it. <strong>CONVECTION</strong></p><p>You prepare a cup of tea and the cup feels warm when touched <strong>CONDUCTION</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>A raw egg begins to fry as it hits the pan. <strong>CONDUCTION</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>The warmth from the sun can make the sand and the water hot.<strong>CONVECTION </strong></p>The food gets warm when placed in the microwave oven.<strong>RADIATION</strong>The clothes become flat and warm when we iron them.<strong>RADIATION</strong>Aircon is placed in high places because warm air rises and cool air sinks.<strong>CONVECTION </strong><p></p><p></p><p>READ MORE ABOUT </p><p><strong>Conduction, Convection, and Radiation</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/97910</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />

                         CLASSIFYING HEAT TRANSFERS RadiationConvectionConductionRadiationConductionConvection<p>//brainly.ph/question/1400265</p>What is Heat Transfer?<strong>Heat </strong>transfer, unlike state functions, is a process function (or route function); hence, the quantity of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system relies on how that process happens, not just the net difference between the starting and final states of the process.The flow of <strong>heat </strong>across a system's boundary due A temperature difference between the system and its surroundings is referred to as a temperature differential.What is Radiation ?The energy emitted by matter in the form of photons or electromagnetic waves is known as adiation<strong> heat</strong> transfer. Even in instances when there is an intervening medium, radiation can be essential. The heat transmission that occurs between a living thing and its surroundings is an example. Photons are a type of energy that is emitted by all living things. //brainly.com/question/24435827What is Convection?Convection is the flow of fluid that allows heat to be transferred from one location to another. Convective heat transfer combines the processes of conduction (heat diffusion) and advection, while being commonly regarded as a separate type of heat transmission (heat transfer by bulk fluid flow). What is Conduction?Conduction heat transfer is the transport of heat within a material by molecular excitation rather than bulk motion. Conduction heat transmission occurs mostly in solids or immobile media like at-rest fluids. //brainly.com/question/12072129DifferencesConduction, Convection, and Radiation: What's the Difference? Heat is transferred between things through direct contact through conduction.The heat is transferred by convection inside the fluid.  Heat is transferred by electromagnetic waves without the need of particles in radiation. The heat transmission is caused by the temperature differential.Their ImportanceRadiation - Many more ways than most people understand that radiation may be utilized to improve one's quality of life. Nuclear energy, which makes use of radioactive elements, offers a wide range of applications in areas such as power generation, medicine, industry, agriculture, and even our own homes.                                                                               Apart from the numerous natural sources of exposure, humanity's harnessing of radiation has resulted in a plethora of applications that we employ on a daily basis. Even while medical tests (such as X-rays) provide the most intentionally induced exposure, we employ radioactive compounds and radiations to sterilise food, extend its shelf life, and prevent fires in public spaces.Convection - Convection is also crucial in a variety of atmospheric processes. The entire arbitrary movement of molecules in a body is referred to as thermal energy. It has a direct link with temperature, which is determined by the quantity of random motion of an item, which correlates to the number of molecules moving in a system.Conduction - Conduction also provides warmth to birds and animals, which is extremely important in colder climates. Furthermore, metals conduct heat and electricity, and as a result of this property, we have heat and power in our houses. The ability of wood to transfer heat allows us to use it for burning.<p>#BRAINLYEVERDAY  </p><br />

Convection</p><p></p><p>==============================</p>Let's Learn!<p></p><p><strong>The process of heat transfer</strong> can happen in <strong>three ways</strong>, these are:</p><p></p><p><strong>Radiation</strong> is the heat transfer by electromagnetic waves through space. It does not require the interaction between matter.</p><p></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p></p>The heat from the Sun warms the different parts of the Earth.You can feel the heat from the sun even if you cannot touch it.<p></p><p><strong>Conduction</strong> is the heat transfer between objects (usually solids) or particles that are directly in contact of each other where one object's temperature rises.</p><p></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p></p>The heat from the fire is transferred to the pot. The heat from the pot is transferred into the soup. The heat from the soup is transferred to the spoon. The heat from the spoon is transferred to your hand as you touch it.Metals and water are good conductor (easily absorbs or allow transfer) of heat, while paper, cloth and wood are not.<p></p><p><strong>Convection</strong> is the heat transfer through fluids (liquids and gases) Iike water and air, </p><p></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p></p>When air is heated it become less dense (lighter) and float. But when air is cooled it become denser (heavier) and sinks to the bottom. This is useful for the hot air balloon. The flame heats the air inside the hot air balloon allowing it to float. And when heat is reduced, the balloon starts to sink or move downward.<p></p><p><strong>Going back to our previous example, let us try to identify the type of heat transfer that occurred in the process.</strong></p><p></p><p>The heat from the fire is transferred into the pot by <strong>radiation</strong>, where the heat travels through waves. The heat from the pot is then transferred Into the soup in the process of <strong>conduction</strong>, where heat is transferred by direct contact between materials. When we stir the soup with a spoon or a ladle, the heat from the soup is transferred into the spoon with the help of <strong>convection</strong>, where heat is transferred through the help of fluids. And when we touch the spoon, we feel the heat from the spoon to our hands by <strong>conduction</strong>. But the heat coming from the boiling pot of soup can be felt even if we do not touch it because of <strong>radiation</strong>. So, you see, a simple activity like this involves a lot of process to happen. Isn't it amazing?</p><p></p><p>⊱┈──────────────────────┈⊰</p>#CarryOnLearning<p>[tex]\mathcal{HopeItHelps}[/tex]</p><p>(ノ^_^)ノ</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Maintaining the correct temperature is critical in chick brooding, especially during the first two weeks of the chick's life. Early in life, the chick is poorly equipped to regulate its metabolic processes to adequately control its body temperature. As a result, the young chick is dependent on environmental temperature to maintain optimal body temperature.   If the room temperature decreases, the chick's body temperature will decrease. Likewise, if room temperature increases, the chick body temperature will increase. Chilling or overheating during this crucial period can result in poor growth, poor feed conversion and increased susceptibility to disease. Proper brooding practices must maintain the chick's body temperature so that it does not have to use energy to lose heat by panting or generate heat through metabolism.</p><br />
