                                            College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

                                            Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</a>

                                            MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</a>

                            6. College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

                            10. Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</h2><br />

                            12. MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
