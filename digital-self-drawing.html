                                            Draw a heart if the statement is TRUE and a triangle A if it FALSE. 1. Oral Language is the system through which we use spoken words to express knowledge, ideas, and feelings. 2. Seeing others nonverbal reactions helps you become a better speaker. 3. Do not organized your thoughts or plan your message ahead of time to make a good impression to the audience. 4. Gesture is the cement that binds together speakers and their audiences. 5. Being thoroughly prepared in a presentation leads to self-confidence, which is a vital ingredient of effective public speaking.6. Finger tapping or chewing gum do not hinder you from delivery a good message to the audience. 7. It is okay to look at your scripts all the time when you feel nervous. 8. When you record your presentation, have your audience sit partially in frame (you should be the main subject of course), so your digital audience can pick up on the nonverbal cues of the in-person audience. 9. If your platform behavior includes mannerisms unrelated to your spoken message, those actions will call attention to themselves and away from your speech. 10. Correct pronunciation of words does not matter when you speak.​</a>

                            7. Draw a heart if the statement is TRUE and a triangle A if it FALSE. 1. Oral Language is the system through which we use spoken words to express knowledge, ideas, and feelings. 2. Seeing others nonverbal reactions helps you become a better speaker. 3. Do not organized your thoughts or plan your message ahead of time to make a good impression to the audience. 4. Gesture is the cement that binds together speakers and their audiences. 5. Being thoroughly prepared in a presentation leads to self-confidence, which is a vital ingredient of effective public speaking.6. Finger tapping or chewing gum do not hinder you from delivery a good message to the audience. 7. It is okay to look at your scripts all the time when you feel nervous. 8. When you record your presentation, have your audience sit partially in frame (you should be the main subject of course), so your digital audience can pick up on the nonverbal cues of the in-person audience. 9. If your platform behavior includes mannerisms unrelated to your spoken message, those actions will call attention to themselves and away from your speech. 10. Correct pronunciation of words does not matter when you speak.​</h2><br />
