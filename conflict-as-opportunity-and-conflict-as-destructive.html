                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Habitats are being destroyed not just because of climate change or poaching but because of plastic bags. Plastic bags, once settled, get into soil and slowly release toxic chemicals. They eventually break down into the soil, with the unfortunate result being that animals eat them and often choke and die.</p><p></p><p>2.The wastes that are dumped into the oceans tend to have toxic substances, which soak in all the oceanic oxygen. This leads to a marked depletion of oxygen available to mammals and other fishes causing them to die in their natural habitat.</p><p></p><p>3.Large scale tree cutting can lead to deforestation, a transformation of an area from forest to terrain with little vegetation. Plants create oxygen and absorb greenhouse gases. The destruction of trees may, therefore, encourage global warming. Changing temperatures can alter which organisms can survive in an ecosystem.</p><p></p><p>4.Tobacco products negatively impact and damage our environment. Cigarette butts are not just a nuisance, they are toxic waste. They contain chemicals that contaminate our waterways and ground soil and harm our wildlife. Discarded lit cigarettes can cause fires, which can damage homes and land.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS!! #CARRYONLEARNING</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Abstract
</p><p>Tannic acid is a naturally occurring substance derived from plants which stains water a brown color, the structure of the tannic acid in water aids in preserving coral reefs.  The destruction of mangrove forests in the coastal wetlands is drastically decreasing the amount of natural tannins in the water and thus subjecting the nearby coral reefs to undue UV radiation.  In effect, the reefs are being sunburned and eventually coral bleaching occurs.  This case study will illustrate the possible reasons for mangrove forest devastation, the linkage between coral bleaching and the former, and finally demonstrate the affects that are beginning to occur.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Broad Picture
</p><p>The wetlands are broadly defined as mangrove forests, mudflats, coral reefs, shallow coastal waters, and estuaries…within this general description lies millions of plant and animal species and several economic and social necessities.  300 million people in only six countries, (75% of those nations’ populations) live within that defined area and 60% of all “animal protein” consumed in that region is seafood alone.   The United States is not without its own dependence upon these coastal regions, the Mississippi Delta wetlands alone account for 25-30% of the nation’s seafood harvest, 19% of the nation’s oil supply, and 25% of America’s gas supply.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Destructively
<p>To respond destructively to a conflict is to be divisive. That would mean inciting hate against people or authorities who are responsible for the budgeting of the club. Create a rumor of corruption happening in the school. It will scatter like fire and it will create an issue. In turn, people will take notice and will donate for the Mathlete team.  </p><p></p>Constructively
<p>As young people, you can only do as much. For sure, school authorities will most likely not listen. However, having a constructive dialogue including parents will be productive and proactive in the long run. To address the conflict, both parties involved must face each other to find a common ground and meet halfway with a solution that is favorable.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18384424</p><br />

                        <p><strong>D.Quality</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Quality</strong> can be estimated by destructive methods and some by non-destructive methods.</p><p></p><p><strong>There are two methods of testing materials in industry, namely by destructive testing and non-destructive testing.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This test is very necessary in the industrial sector because this test will help determine the quality of industrial materials and the properties of the materials to be used in industry</strong>. Materials used in industry such as iron, stainless, concrete, aluminum, steel, wood etc. will be tested before use.</p><p></p><p><strong>Further explanation:</strong></p><p></p><strong>Destructive Methods</strong><p></p><p><strong>Destructive Testing</strong> is a test carried out on a material or object specimen to be tested until the material is damaged. This test is carried out to determine the performance of the material in question, one of which is when the material is subjected to external work with different forces. These tests are generally much easier to carry out, and provide better information than non-destructive tests.</p><p></p><p><strong>Destructive Testing</strong> is better done and will be more economical for objects that will be mass produced or in large quantities, for example for the production of cars and motorcycles.</p><p></p><strong>Non destructive testing (NDT)</strong><p></p><p><strong>Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)</strong> is an activity of testing or inspection of an object to find out for defects, cracks, or other discontinuities without damaging the object we are testing or inspecting. Basically, this test is carried out to ensure that the material we use is still safe and has not passed damage tolerance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Non-Destructive Testing</strong> is carried out at least twice. First, during and at the end of the fabrication process, to determine whether a component is acceptable after going through the fabrication stages. This NDT is used as part of component quality control. Second, NDT is carried out after the components have been used for a certain period of time. The goal is to find a partial failure before it exceeds its damage tolerance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Common NDT methods include</strong> ultrasonic, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiography, remote visual inspection (RVI), eddy-current testing, and low coherence interferometry NDT is a tool frequently used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and the arts.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about destructive method and non-destructive method, visit the following links:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8701670</p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />

A mediator helps in identifying the interests of both parties and finding common ground for resolution.</p><p></p><p>7. Forgiveness: Forgiveness is the act of letting go of resentment and anger towards the other party. It is important to practice forgiveness to move forward from the conflict and maintain a peaceful relationship. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, resolving conflicts peacefully involves effective communication, empathy, active listening, respect, compromise, mediation, and forgiveness. Through these steps, individuals can build mutual trust and understanding, find common ground for resolution, and prevent destructive outcomes like war.</p><br />
