</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CADAC<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The word virus comes from a Latin word meaning venom and describes a tiny, tiny agent that causes infectious disease. Coronavirus is a family of viruses that got its name from its appearance.
</p><p>
</p><p>The word corona means crown. The scientists who in 1968 came up with the term coronavirus thought that, under a microscope, the virus they were looking at resembled a solar corona: the bright crown-like ring of gasses surrounding the sun that is visible during a solar eclipse. (The beer brand Corona, incidentally, based its logo on the crown atop the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Puerto Vallarta.)
</p><p>
</p><p>Though the disease currently spreading around the globe — COVID-19 — is often called coronavirus, it’s really a disease caused by one type of coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2. Calling this particular one novel coronavirus is simply a way of making it clear which coronavirus is at issue: the new one.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Dictionary.com breaks down in a thorough explainer, the name COVID-19 was derived from the year it was first detected (2019) and using letters from CO-rona-VI-rus D-isease. If you’re wondering how to say it, a helpful (if somewhat glib) reminder is that it can be said and read with the same cadence as “Come On, Eileen.”
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>outbreak / epidemic / pandemic
</p><p>These are crescendoing terms. Per Merriam-Webster, an outbreak is “a sudden rise in the incidence of a disease,” which is usually confined to one area or group of people. When there are enough outbreaks, in places beyond that initial spot, that amounts to an epidemic. A pandemic is an epidemic that has become a worldwide phenomenon. When does something officially become “worldwide”? There’s no absolute answer.
</p><p>
</p><p>symptom / symptomatic / asymptomatic / incubation
</p><p>Many of the words that are seeing the biggest spikes on Dictionary.com are exotic ones like coronavirus. But senior research editor John Kelly says people are also looking up more familiar fare: words like symptom, a sign or indication that someone has a disease.
</p><p>
</p><p>vaccine
</p><p>Dictionary.com has also seen an uptick in searches for the word vaccine. The idea behind them is fairly simple: inject a person with a weak version of the same virus that causes a disease — weak enough that it doesn’t make the person sick, but potent enough that it stimulates the person’s immune system to produce antibodies that can vanquish that disease. As the CDC puts it, “After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.”
</p><p>individual’s emotional feelings of separation from others or the intimacy that exists, or doesn’t, between different classes or ethnic groups. In the case of COVID-19, it generally describes actions taken to minimize contact among people.

</p><p>
</p><p>also infect humans. A report from the WHO suggests that bats might have been a host of the virus, though it could have passed through other species before arriving on humanity’s doorstep. Experts continue to trace its origins. Zoonotic diseases, including things like Lyme disease and E. Coli, are common. According to the CDC, about 75% of emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals.

As the CDC puts it, “After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.”
</p><p>
</p><p>herd immunity
</p><p>When enough people in a given population have taken an effective vaccine, that community develops what is known as herd immunity: people are more protected from getting the disease, even if they haven’t had the vaccine, because the vast majority is immune and incapable of spreading it. Right now, testing is underway for a vaccine that could protect individuals from COVID-19, though it will likely take a year to complete.
