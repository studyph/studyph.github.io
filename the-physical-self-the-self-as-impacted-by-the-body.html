                                            STRESS When people hear the word stress, they react differently. Some people keep on saying that they feel stressed out. Stress is a feeling of being under abnormal pressure. This pressure can come from different aspects of your day-to-day life. Such as an increased workload, a transitional period, an argument you have with your family or new and existing financial worries. You may find that it has a cumulative effect, with each stressor building on top of one another. During these situations, you may feel threatened or upset and your body might create a stress response. This can cause a variety of physical symptoms; change the way you behave and lead you to experience more intense emotions. Stress affects us in a numerous of ways, both physically and emotionally, and in varying intensities. Research has shown that stress can sometimes be positive. can make you more alert and help you perform better in certain situations. However, stress has only found out to be beneficial if it is short-lived. Excessive or prolonged stress can contribute to illness such as heart disease and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Some common symptoms of stress include sleeping problems, sweating, or a change in appetite. Symptoms like these are triggered by a rush of stress hormones in your body which, when released, allow you to deal with pressures or threats. This is known as the fight or flight response. When stress affects the brain, with its many nerve connections, the rest of the body feels the impact as well. So, it is logical to say that if your body feels better, so does your mind. Exercise and any physical activity produce endorphins chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress. Meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, even breathing deeply can cause your body to produce endorphins. And conventional wisdom holds that a workout of low to moderate intensity makes you feel energized and healthy. Scientists have found that regular participation in aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease overall levels of tension, elevate and stabilize mood, improve sleep, and improve self-esteem. Even five minutes of aerobic exercise can stimulate anti-anxiety effects. Directions: List down physical activities that help reduce one's stress. Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper or in the answer sheet provided by your teacher. PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES: 1. 2. 3. 4 5.​</a>

                                            what I can DoUsing the same data extracted table from the unpublishedresearch paper identify the table which the following interpretationbest describeInterpretation A: Table #Most (3 out of 5) of the respondentswere worried much for they do not knowwhat to do with the situation. The role changing happened due to physical changes ofthe body and the thought of having another life put themselves in a dilemma ofadditional responsibility yet they are too young, incapable of supporting oneself andfinancially dependent from parents for their studies. Since the partner also do nothave the capability to handle the responsibility, for they are still young to think of,some got separated leaving the teenage mother to take all the responsibilities.Though parents felt bad, they still accepted and no other choice but to help theteenage pregnant mother.According to Bandura as stated by Cherry (2011) acceptance is an importantstage in the process to reach the goal of successful adjustment. People with a strongsense of self-efficacy: view challenging problems as tasks to be mastered, developdeeper interest in the activities in which they participate, form a stronger sense ofcommitment to their interests and activities, and recover quickly from setbacks anddisappointments.Interpretation B: Table #Majority (3 out of 5) of the respondents felt much better as their parentsaccepted the fact of being pregnant at an early age despite the drama of thesituation. Table 3 showed that acceptance of having a baby, role changes to self andnew responsibilities made the respondents happy towards adjustment with the helpand support of parents and friends. Excitement of the coming of the baby is ablessing in disguise for the family and friends that somehow gave encouragement tothe teenage mother to continue to take care and love and determined to continuetheir studies in preparation for the future of oneself and the baby.A different way or process of adjustment, that starts with the sense of self ofhaving an impact on life experiences, which somehow relationships of family, andfriends have the influenced on how to undergo the process of adjustment. Accordingto Añonuevo, C.A as stated by Natividad et al, (2005), family is still the primarysource of care. The family is very important in the care of adolescents. Though thefamily is facing many changes and challenges, it continues to have the responsibilityof taking care of each member's needs. Such relationships of close family tiescherished older person to adjust situations of life successfully.Pa answer po​</a>

                            8. STRESS When people hear the word stress, they react differently. Some people keep on saying that they feel stressed out. Stress is a feeling of being under abnormal pressure. This pressure can come from different aspects of your day-to-day life. Such as an increased workload, a transitional period, an argument you have with your family or new and existing financial worries. You may find that it has a cumulative effect, with each stressor building on top of one another. During these situations, you may feel threatened or upset and your body might create a stress response. This can cause a variety of physical symptoms; change the way you behave and lead you to experience more intense emotions. Stress affects us in a numerous of ways, both physically and emotionally, and in varying intensities. Research has shown that stress can sometimes be positive. can make you more alert and help you perform better in certain situations. However, stress has only found out to be beneficial if it is short-lived. Excessive or prolonged stress can contribute to illness such as heart disease and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Some common symptoms of stress include sleeping problems, sweating, or a change in appetite. Symptoms like these are triggered by a rush of stress hormones in your body which, when released, allow you to deal with pressures or threats. This is known as the fight or flight response. When stress affects the brain, with its many nerve connections, the rest of the body feels the impact as well. So, it is logical to say that if your body feels better, so does your mind. Exercise and any physical activity produce endorphins chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress. Meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, even breathing deeply can cause your body to produce endorphins. And conventional wisdom holds that a workout of low to moderate intensity makes you feel energized and healthy. Scientists have found that regular participation in aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease overall levels of tension, elevate and stabilize mood, improve sleep, and improve self-esteem. Even five minutes of aerobic exercise can stimulate anti-anxiety effects. Directions: List down physical activities that help reduce one's stress. Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper or in the answer sheet provided by your teacher. PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES: 1. 2. 3. 4 5.​</h2><br />

                            21. what I can DoUsing the same data extracted table from the unpublishedresearch paper identify the table which the following interpretationbest describeInterpretation A: Table #Most (3 out of 5) of the respondentswere worried much for they do not knowwhat to do with the situation. The role changing happened due to physical changes ofthe body and the thought of having another life put themselves in a dilemma ofadditional responsibility yet they are too young, incapable of supporting oneself andfinancially dependent from parents for their studies. Since the partner also do nothave the capability to handle the responsibility, for they are still young to think of,some got separated leaving the teenage mother to take all the responsibilities.Though parents felt bad, they still accepted and no other choice but to help theteenage pregnant mother.According to Bandura as stated by Cherry (2011) acceptance is an importantstage in the process to reach the goal of successful adjustment. People with a strongsense of self-efficacy: view challenging problems as tasks to be mastered, developdeeper interest in the activities in which they participate, form a stronger sense ofcommitment to their interests and activities, and recover quickly from setbacks anddisappointments.Interpretation B: Table #Majority (3 out of 5) of the respondents felt much better as their parentsaccepted the fact of being pregnant at an early age despite the drama of thesituation. Table 3 showed that acceptance of having a baby, role changes to self andnew responsibilities made the respondents happy towards adjustment with the helpand support of parents and friends. Excitement of the coming of the baby is ablessing in disguise for the family and friends that somehow gave encouragement tothe teenage mother to continue to take care and love and determined to continuetheir studies in preparation for the future of oneself and the baby.A different way or process of adjustment, that starts with the sense of self ofhaving an impact on life experiences, which somehow relationships of family, andfriends have the influenced on how to undergo the process of adjustment. Accordingto Añonuevo, C.A as stated by Natividad et al, (2005), family is still the primarysource of care. The family is very important in the care of adolescents. Though thefamily is facing many changes and challenges, it continues to have the responsibilityof taking care of each member's needs. Such relationships of close family tiescherished older person to adjust situations of life successfully.Pa answer po​</h2><br />
