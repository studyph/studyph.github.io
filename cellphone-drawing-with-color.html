It must contain the design elements (lines, shapes, color, and texture) and principles (emphasis or contrast). Tell something about it in 3-5 sentences and write it below the image. Your artwork must be drawn using MS Paint or any drawing software then print it in a short bond paper. Give an interesting title to the image you created and you need to write it using paint tool. As an alternative in the absence of a computer or drawing software you can do your artwork by hand in a short bond paper using pencil, marker and water color.Paki answer ng maayos please​</a>
