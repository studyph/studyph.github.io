By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text?

                                            Activity 2.1 Why does academic writing need to be formal, objective, complex, concise and specific? To find the answer to this question read the text below and underline the word that best completes each sentence. An academic is responsible for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. This is serious business and a/an 1) (informal, formal , complex) writing style reflects the Importance and sincerity of this work. If an academic text contains informal casual language, the credibility of the writer is weakened. Therefore, in an academic text you see 2) (formal, concise, sophisticated) academic vocabulary and words written in their 3) (shorter, complex, full) form. Academic writing appears 4) (complex, concise, specialized) because it often refers to abstract ideas, whereas everyday language is more concrete and familiar. Academic subjects have their own 5) (specialized, formal, unnecessary) vocabulary too which students of other subjects may not be familiar with. Oddly, if English is not your first language, the importance of being 6) (complex, concise, objective) in academic writing adds to this complexity. Sentences that are structured around 7) (noun, verb, adverb) phrases are generally 8) (unnecessary, complex, concise) and clearer than sentences constructed around 9) (noun, verb, adverb), but they may be more difficult for students to write. The same is true when writers use sentences that contain subordinate clauses or lists. Sophisticated adverbs and connecting words, and 10) (use, definitions, highlighting) of important words also add to the darity and precision of academic writing. An academic paper should be written in an 11) (academic, objective, informal) style. Academics focus on information and argumentation. In other words, they establish the facts by writing about what they have leamed from others and from that own research, and how this has led to new conclusions. This style of writing therefore avoids personal 12) (pronouns, words, stories) and the passive voice is a common linguistic feature. Emotional language is also avoided. Being assertive, and therefore appearing superior and arrogant, is regarded negatively. Writers are expected to be cautious, or tentative, about the conclusions they come to and so 13) (hesitating complexity, hedging) is another typical characteristic of academic writing​</a>

Modern Generafion Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom. He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc. Todays youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading is the opinion of majority of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol, smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is furning from bad to worse is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home, college, workplace or the church temple, mosque and gurudwara. The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent couse they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society. By this! mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands. 1.

                                            Education is of great consequence to children for they are the future of the nation. President Duterte echoed this sentiment when he said, "the future of this country depends on how we educate our young people nowadays." The DepEd's aspiration to continue the formal education of the youth through alternative and innovative learning pathways despite the prevalent COVID-19 threat becomes all the more pertinent and relevant. While there are challenges in implementing "blended learning", the need to educate the young people of the country is not only essential but also imperative. Taking into consideration all the perceived challenges that "blended learning" may encounter, the support for and cooperation with the DepEd among all possible stakeholders is crucial. In this regard, it is reassuring that President Duterte said, "it is but good that the government is full force in its support to DepEd to fully extend all the necessary assistance for DepEd to carry out blended learning." There is no doubt that the DepEd through the active and able leadership of Sec. Briones will ensure that everything will be on-track and in place for "blended learning" to work. Nevertheless, it is also the responsibility of parents and guardians to decide what's best for their children based on their respective realities. The decision to enroll or not is a voluntary process, and it is in the hands of parents/guardians to decide whether to allow their children to attend formal education this school year (2020-2021) or not.

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />

                            7. Activity 2.1 Why does academic writing need to be formal, objective, complex, concise and specific? To find the answer to this question read the text below and underline the word that best completes each sentence. An academic is responsible for expanding the boundaries of knowledge. This is serious business and a/an 1) (informal, formal , complex) writing style reflects the Importance and sincerity of this work. If an academic text contains informal casual language, the credibility of the writer is weakened. Therefore, in an academic text you see 2) (formal, concise, sophisticated) academic vocabulary and words written in their 3) (shorter, complex, full) form. Academic writing appears 4) (complex, concise, specialized) because it often refers to abstract ideas, whereas everyday language is more concrete and familiar. Academic subjects have their own 5) (specialized, formal, unnecessary) vocabulary too which students of other subjects may not be familiar with. Oddly, if English is not your first language, the importance of being 6) (complex, concise, objective) in academic writing adds to this complexity. Sentences that are structured around 7) (noun, verb, adverb) phrases are generally 8) (unnecessary, complex, concise) and clearer than sentences constructed around 9) (noun, verb, adverb), but they may be more difficult for students to write. The same is true when writers use sentences that contain subordinate clauses or lists. Sophisticated adverbs and connecting words, and 10) (use, definitions, highlighting) of important words also add to the darity and precision of academic writing. An academic paper should be written in an 11) (academic, objective, informal) style. Academics focus on information and argumentation. In other words, they establish the facts by writing about what they have leamed from others and from that own research, and how this has led to new conclusions. This style of writing therefore avoids personal 12) (pronouns, words, stories) and the passive voice is a common linguistic feature. Emotional language is also avoided. Being assertive, and therefore appearing superior and arrogant, is regarded negatively. Writers are expected to be cautious, or tentative, about the conclusions they come to and so 13) (hesitating complexity, hedging) is another typical characteristic of academic writing​</h2><br />

Modern Generafion Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom. He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc. Todays youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading is the opinion of majority of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol, smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is furning from bad to worse is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home, college, workplace or the church temple, mosque and gurudwara. The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent couse they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society. By this! mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands. 1.

                            12. Education is of great consequence to children for they are the future of the nation. President Duterte echoed this sentiment when he said, "the future of this country depends on how we educate our young people nowadays." The DepEd's aspiration to continue the formal education of the youth through alternative and innovative learning pathways despite the prevalent COVID-19 threat becomes all the more pertinent and relevant. While there are challenges in implementing "blended learning", the need to educate the young people of the country is not only essential but also imperative. Taking into consideration all the perceived challenges that "blended learning" may encounter, the support for and cooperation with the DepEd among all possible stakeholders is crucial. In this regard, it is reassuring that President Duterte said, "it is but good that the government is full force in its support to DepEd to fully extend all the necessary assistance for DepEd to carry out blended learning." There is no doubt that the DepEd through the active and able leadership of Sec. Briones will ensure that everything will be on-track and in place for "blended learning" to work. Nevertheless, it is also the responsibility of parents and guardians to decide what's best for their children based on their respective realities. The decision to enroll or not is a voluntary process, and it is in the hands of parents/guardians to decide whether to allow their children to attend formal education this school year (2020-2021) or not.

                            13. Learning Task 2 Read the article below and outline the key concepts that are presented therein. Write your answers in your notebook Modern Generation Youth Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modem generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent cause they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society By this 1 mean it is the youth who can implement the aws and make the required changes To bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.1.
