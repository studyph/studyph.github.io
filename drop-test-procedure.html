                                            Plastic Wastes into Bricks (Abstract) This study was conducted at Brgy. Poblacion, Banate, Iloilo to produce bricks out of plastic wastes that help reduce the wastes in the society. The purpose of this study is to produce a brick out of plastic wastes, which is what the people need to help recycle plastic wastes. The researchers underwent several procedures such as gathering materials, shredding, mixing and molding. The researchers decided to pursue this study because recycling is duly practiced in the Philippines. Another major reason why the researchers focused on this is to reuse plastic wastes. The researchers melted the plastics and transformed into a brick so it can be used again. The materials used were the following: cement, strainer, plastics, and water. The researchers gathered the plastics, cut them into small pieces and strained them to make them finer. Cement and water were added and these were mixed together. After mixing thoroughly, the mixture was put into a molder and allowed it to dry. After several days, it was tested by dropping the formed product into the ground. It was proven that it was strong enough and could be used as alternative brick. (Bautista, Adrianne Marie, Baylon, Angeleca, Reyes, Trexie Grace Dianne, 2018-2019)​</a>

                            10. Plastic Wastes into Bricks (Abstract) This study was conducted at Brgy. Poblacion, Banate, Iloilo to produce bricks out of plastic wastes that help reduce the wastes in the society. The purpose of this study is to produce a brick out of plastic wastes, which is what the people need to help recycle plastic wastes. The researchers underwent several procedures such as gathering materials, shredding, mixing and molding. The researchers decided to pursue this study because recycling is duly practiced in the Philippines. Another major reason why the researchers focused on this is to reuse plastic wastes. The researchers melted the plastics and transformed into a brick so it can be used again. The materials used were the following: cement, strainer, plastics, and water. The researchers gathered the plastics, cut them into small pieces and strained them to make them finer. Cement and water were added and these were mixed together. After mixing thoroughly, the mixture was put into a molder and allowed it to dry. After several days, it was tested by dropping the formed product into the ground. It was proven that it was strong enough and could be used as alternative brick. (Bautista, Adrianne Marie, Baylon, Angeleca, Reyes, Trexie Grace Dianne, 2018-2019)​</h2><br />
