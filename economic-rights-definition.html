                                            Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the UN(an excerpt)"I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either... If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I applaud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when?

                                            QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</a>

                                            La Solidaridad was a newspaper which was published in Barcelona, Spain on February 15, 1889. It was edited by Graciano López Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The social, cultural, and economic condi-tions of the colonial Philippines was published in La Solidaridad. Speeches of the Spanish liberals about the Philippines was also featured in the news-paper.La Solidaridad was established to express the goal of the Propaganda Movement towards achieving assimilation with Spain. The first issue of La Solidaridad came out on February 15, 1889. A fortnightly and a bi-weekly newspaper, La Solidaridad serves as the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Comite de Propaganda in the Philippines funded the publication of the La Solidaridad. The editorship for the newspaper was first offered to Rizal. However, he refused because during that time he was annotating Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas in Lon- don. After Rizal, Graciano López Jaena was offered for the editorship of La Solidari- dad and he accepted. On April 25, 1889, La Solidaridad published the letter entitled "The aspira- tions of the Filipinos" which was written by the Asociación Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (English: Hispanic Filipino Association of Madrid).[3] It pursued desires for: • Representation in the Cortes • Abolition of censure • An expressed and definite prohibition of the existing practices of exiling residents by purely administrative order, and without a writ of execution from the courts of justice. On December 15, 1889, Marcelo H. del Pilar replaced Graciano López Jaena as the editor of La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. His articles caught the attention of Spanish leaders and ministers.Using propaganda, it pursued desires for: • That the Philippines be a province of Spain • Representation Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars — Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans — in parishes and remote sitios • Freedom of assembly and speech • Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comite de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own.

                                            What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</a>

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                            7. QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</h2><br />

                            8. La Solidaridad was a newspaper which was published in Barcelona, Spain on February 15, 1889. It was edited by Graciano López Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The social, cultural, and economic condi-tions of the colonial Philippines was published in La Solidaridad. Speeches of the Spanish liberals about the Philippines was also featured in the news-paper.La Solidaridad was established to express the goal of the Propaganda Movement towards achieving assimilation with Spain. The first issue of La Solidaridad came out on February 15, 1889. A fortnightly and a bi-weekly newspaper, La Solidaridad serves as the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Comite de Propaganda in the Philippines funded the publication of the La Solidaridad. The editorship for the newspaper was first offered to Rizal. However, he refused because during that time he was annotating Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas in Lon- don. After Rizal, Graciano López Jaena was offered for the editorship of La Solidari- dad and he accepted. On April 25, 1889, La Solidaridad published the letter entitled "The aspira- tions of the Filipinos" which was written by the Asociación Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (English: Hispanic Filipino Association of Madrid).[3] It pursued desires for: • Representation in the Cortes • Abolition of censure • An expressed and definite prohibition of the existing practices of exiling residents by purely administrative order, and without a writ of execution from the courts of justice. On December 15, 1889, Marcelo H. del Pilar replaced Graciano López Jaena as the editor of La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. His articles caught the attention of Spanish leaders and ministers.Using propaganda, it pursued desires for: • That the Philippines be a province of Spain • Representation Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars — Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans — in parishes and remote sitios • Freedom of assembly and speech • Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comite de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own.

                            14. What do you learn about this? Community as a Social Organization Community is a dynamic social grouping whose members settles in a specific physical space, submit to a common political institution, engage in similar economic activities and share common cultural and historical heritage orientation. Its definition described the community as an interacting population of various individuals in aparticular area. A community is a group of people and since they share common physical space they are bound to establish patterns of interactions which lead to the formation of a cultural, political and economic structure that influenced the everyday life of the people. The element of time contributes largely to the formation of commonalities in both physical and social traits. There are other communities in which the absence of common characteristics is very evident and they are often located in urban areas. Economic opportunities in urban communities encouraged migration of people from different provinces. These people bring with them different normative traits that further complicates the already diverse cultural environment. This kind of situation makes it difficult for the community to progress into one cohesive social organization. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes. The existence of social problems is shown through the inability of the people to live a life they deserved in a normal social environment. Social problems, though may be said to be a normal occurrence even in developed societies, must be addressed to prevent them from hampering the productivity of the people. The common denominator to the attainment of sustainable development is the ability of the people to match the demands of the economy. There can be a variety of ways to combat social dysfunctions. However, solutions must be tailor-fitted to the problems at hand for it to be effective. This means that experts who will attempt to find solution to particular social perplexities must be able to exhibit skills in sizing up the nature of the problems from which solutions must be figured out. Finding the Right Ideas If there can’t be perfect individual more so with a community. It should be noted that development is not an end in itself but a process within a segmentalized social structure that requires constant scrutiny in the hope of abating impacts of any dysfunctional elements to attain sustainability. Development does not eradicate social problems. Rather development provides the elements that cause mutations of the problems. As the community develops, problems change characteristics and therefore must be confronted with different antidotes.​</h2><br />

                            18. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."
