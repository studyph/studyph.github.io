Although the moon rises in the east and sets in the west each day (due to Earth's spin), it's also moving on the sky's dome each day due to its own motion in orbit around Earth. ...

</p><p>What if Earth stopped spinning?
</p><p>If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1100 mile per hour rotation speed at the equator. ... This means rocks, topsoil, trees, buildings, your pet dog, and so on, would be swept away into the atmosphere.

</p><p>Scientists say Earth is spinning faster than it has in decades. The Earth's 28 fastest days on record (since 1960) all occurred in 2020. The Earth's rotation can change slightly because of weather and ocean patterns.8 Jan 2021

</p><p>When the Three Gorges Dam was built, 39 trillion kilograms of water from the Yangtze River built up behind it to 175 meters above sea level. This altered the Earth's moment of inertia changed ever so slightly, causing the rotation to move more slowly.27 Mar 2014

</p><p>
</p><p>The fact is that even though the Earth rotates at over 1,000 miles per hour at the equator (1,037.54 mph to be exact), and slower as you go north or south. If you were out in space far enough away from the earth to see the whole planet it would appear to turn so slowly that it would appear motionless.

</p><p>The earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09053 seconds, called the sidereal period, and its circumference is roughly 40,075 kilometers. Thus, the surface of the earth at the equator moves at a speed of 460 meters per second--or roughly 1,000 miles per hour.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
