                                            Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.Teenage VapingIt's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world. Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young persons quickly become addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases, some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to vape.19.

Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.

Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young persons quickly become addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases, some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to vape.19.

                            30. Let’s Apply
Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.
