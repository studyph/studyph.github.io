                                            In a science class, teacher Ana showed a short video clip to introduce her lesson about the process of photosynthesis. After the video presentation, she proceeded to engage the class in an open discussion about what they have learned from the material. To her surprise, the whole class is passive and did not show interest to express their reactions or their thoughts and even to raise questions about what they have seen in the video. The class claimed that the concept of the photosynthesis as shown in the video is too complex for them to understand.
Teacher Ana went home quite unhappy with the result of using technology to deliver her lesson. She believes that she tried her best to use technology in teaching, and even went to the extent of asking help from her co-teacher to download the material and have it ready for class presentation.
1. What are the possible problems in the scenario?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1. What is the video all about?<p>The video is all about circulating fake news about confirmed cases of Corona virus in the Philippines.  The video was released in January 27, 2020 in which it features DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III. The clip of CNN also features about patients who are under investigations if the symptoms they have are afflicted with the Novel Corona virus. It also includes health protocols that an individual can do to prevent being infected. Aside from that ,the two-minute video features Leonora Briones, DepEd Sec, about class suspensions but suggests a make-up class.</p><p></p><p></p>2. What is the message of the video?<p></p><p> message of the video content is to not believe about conspiracy theories, lies, and unverified information circulating through mobile messages, social media, or in close circles. According the the report, there are confirmed cases in Binondo and Alabang but these are mere speculations and not based on truth. </p><p>It urges the public to listen only to verified news channels and media providers. </p><p></p>3. What issues were discussed in the video?<p></p><p>The issues discussed in the videos are about the current state of CORONA VIRUS in the country. So far, there are less than 10 who are foreigners kept in quarantine. Some Filipinos also who travelled to China is under quarantine and observation but it is not yet confirmed if they have the novel corona virus. The other issue is about the schools if they should be suspended. Some schools, especially private ones, suspended classes to ease for possible infections. </p><p></p>4. What is "disinfodemic"? Discuss.<p>Disinfodemic is a portmanteau of Disinformation + pandemic/epidemic.</p><p>Virus also spreads and so is disinformation. In fact, disinformation spreads faster than real information. And so , with this health crisis, the government has to address this problem it came along with. It is problematic because this is creating unnecessary worry, anxiety, and stress. Disinformation leads to worst decisions of the public. So, it is important that news should be verified and the public must learn to discriminate fake from verified news. </p><p></p>5. What is the relevance of the video to the challenges faced by the country regarding fake news and the spread of the virus?<p></p><p>The third-party effect on fake news related to infectious diseases spread through social media. The purpose of this video is to examine the factors influencing the third-party effect, and to examine the relationship between the act of eradicating fake news, the recognition of regulations, and the prevention of infectious diseases. </p><p>Fake news during pandemic creates anxiety and stress. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15330072</p><br />

                            13. In a science class, teacher Ana showed a short video clip to introduce her lesson about the process of photosynthesis. After the video presentation, she proceeded to engage the class in an open discussion about what they have learned from the material. To her surprise, the whole class is passive and did not show interest to express their reactions or their thoughts and even to raise questions about what they have seen in the video. The class claimed that the concept of the photosynthesis as shown in the video is too complex for them to understand.
Teacher Ana went home quite unhappy with the result of using technology to deliver her lesson. She believes that she tried her best to use technology in teaching, and even went to the extent of asking help from her co-teacher to download the material and have it ready for class presentation.
1. What are the possible problems in the scenario?
2. Classify the problem and cite other interrelated issues and concerns in the use of technology, teaching strategy, and teacher's technology skills as you observed in the scenario?
3. Suggest several solutions to the problems and to the other issues and concerns you have identified in the scenario.</h2><br />
                        The possible problems in the scenario are: lack of student engagement and participation during class discussion, difficulty in understanding the concept of photosynthesis as presented in the video, teacher's frustration and disappointment with the outcome of the lessonThe problem in the scenario falls under the category of technology integration in teaching. Some interrelated issues and concerns include: the suitability of the video material to the students' level of understanding and prior knowledge, T=the effectiveness of using technology as a teaching tool, the teacher's level of proficiency and skills in using technology for instructional purposes, the students' level of digital literacy and ability to navigate and make sense of technology-based materialsTo address the problems and interrelated issues and concerns, the following solutions may be considered: Pre-assess the students' prior knowledge and understanding of the concept of photosynthesis to determine the appropriate level of teaching and instructional materials, choose a video material that is appropriate to the students' level of understanding and ensure that it is aligned with the learning objectives of the lesson, use a variety of teaching strategies, such as group discussions, think-pair-share, and problem-based learning, to engage students and promote active participation, provide opportunities for students to ask questions and clarify their understanding of the topic, conduct a skills assessment of the teacher and provide necessary training and support to enhance their proficiency in using technology for instructional purposes, offer digital literacy training and support to students to enhance their ability to navigate and make sense of technology-based materials.<br />

                        <p>1. <strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Youtube.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Youtube is the easiest way to access a video clip in our country.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>COMPONENTS OF VIDEO</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Component <strong>video</strong> is a simple <strong>video</strong> signal that has been parted into at least two component channels. In well known use, it alludes to a kind of component simple video data that is communicated or put away as three separate signs. Component <strong>video</strong> can be appeared differently in relation to composite video in which all the <strong>video</strong> data is joined into a solitary sign that is utilized in simple TV. Like composite, component-<strong>video</strong> links don't convey sound and are frequently combined with sound links.</p><p></p><p>When utilized with no different capabilities, the term component <strong>video</strong> for the most part alludes to simple YPBPR component video with sync on luma found on simple superior quality TVs and related gear from the 1990s through the 2000s when they were generally supplanted with HDMI and other every single advanced norm. Component video links and their RCA jack connectors on hardware are regularly shading coded red, green and blue, albeit the sign isn't in RGB. YPbPr component <strong>video</strong> can be losslessly changed over to the RGB signal that inside drives the screen; the encoding is valuable as the Y sign will likewise deal with highly contrasting screens.</p><p></p><p>3. With the use of computers, a student's life has been made very convenient. By just using this device, <strong>students can write and research their school works online and communicate with their classmates and teachers through email or other platforms for shared discussions and knowledge</strong>.</p><br />
