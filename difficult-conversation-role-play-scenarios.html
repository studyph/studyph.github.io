                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong>The Little Prince Meets The Fox</strong><p><strong>Narrator:</strong>The little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near---
</p><p><strong>Fox: </strong>"Ah," "I shall cry."
</p><p><strong>Little Prince: </strong>"It's your own fault," "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
</p><p><strong>Fox</strong>: "Yes that is so", said the fox.
</p><p><strong>Little Prince</strong>: "But now you're going to cry!"
</p><p><strong>Fox</strong>: "Yes that is so"  </p><p><strong>Little Prince: </strong>"Then it has done you no good at all!"
</p><p><strong>Fox: </strong>"It has done me good," “because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added: "go and look again at the roses. You'll understand now that yours is unique in the entire world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.  </p><p><strong>Little Prince:</strong> "You're not at all like my rose," "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You're like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made a friend, and now he's unique in the entire world."  </p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> And the roses were very much embarrassed.  </p><p><strong>Little Prince: </strong>"You're beautiful, but you're empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you --the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she's more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is for her that I've killed the caterpillars (except the two or three we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose."
</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: And he went back to meet the fox.  </p><p><strong>Little Prince:</strong> "Goodbye"
</p><p><strong>Fox:</strong> "Goodbye," "And now here's my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
</p><p><strong>Little Prince: </strong>"What is essential is invisible to the eye," (2x)
</p><p><strong>Fox: </strong>"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
</p><p><strong>Little Prince:</strong> "It is the time I have wasted for my rose--"  </p><p><strong>Fox: </strong>"Men have forgotten this truth," "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."
</p><p><strong>Little Prince: </strong>"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.

Bullying is a prevalent issue in schools worldwide, and ZNHS may not be an exception. Understanding the nature and extent of bullying in the school can help identify areas that need improvement and develop effective interventions.</p><p></p><p>2. Bullying can have negative effects on students' mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. Identifying the impact of bullying on students in ZNHS can help raise awareness among teachers, parents, and administrators and promote a safe and supportive school environment.</p><p></p><p>3. Anti-bullying policies and interventions can be effective in reducing the prevalence of bullying and improving the school climate. Evaluating the effectiveness of current policies and interventions in ZNHS can help identify areas that need improvement and develop evidence-based strategies to address the problem.</p><p></p><p>Overall, researching bullying in ZNHS can provide valuable insights into the prevalence, impact, and effectiveness of anti-bullying policies and interventions in the school, and promote a safe and supportive environment for all students.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 1: Define Research Problem</p><p>The research problem we will be addressing is the prevalence of bullying in ZNHS and its impact on the students' academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 2: Review the Literature</p><p>According to previous studies, bullying is a common problem in schools and can have negative effects on students' academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. Students who are bullied may experience anxiety, depression, and a decrease in academic performance. It is also important to note that bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and cyberbullying.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 3: Formulate the Hypothesis</p><p>Based on the literature review, we can formulate the following hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between bullying and the academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being of students in ZNHS.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 4: Design Research</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we will design a mixed-methods research study. First, we will conduct a survey to gather quantitative data on the prevalence of bullying in ZNHS and its impact on students' academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with selected students and teachers to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences and perspectives of those involved in bullying.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 5: Collect Data</p><p>We will collect data through a survey questionnaire that will be administered to all students in ZNHS. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with selected students and teachers in the school.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 6: Analyze Data</p><p>We will use statistical analysis to analyze the survey data and identify any significant relationships between bullying and academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. We will also use thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data from the interviews and identify common themes related to bullying in ZNHS.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 7: Interpret and Report</p><p>Based on our analysis of the data, we will interpret our findings and prepare a report that summarizes our results. We will also provide recommendations for interventions and strategies to address bullying in ZNHS and promote a safe and supportive school environment for all students.</p><br />

                        <p>Scenario 1: Research Problem</p><p>Bullying has become a prevalent issue in schools, including at Zamboanga National High School (ZNHS). In recent years, several incidences of bullying have been reported in the school, causing physical, emotional, and psychological damage to students. Therefore, the primary research problem is to understand the extent and nature of bullying in ZNHS, its effects on student's academic and social development, and the factors contributing to it.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 2: Review of the Literature</p><p>Several researchers have studied the issue of bullying in schools, and their findings indicate that it is a widespread problem affecting students of all ages, genders, and socio-economic backgrounds. According to Olweus (1993), bullying involves aggressive behavior that is repeated over time, where the victim finds it challenging to defend themselves. Studies have shown that bullying has severe consequences for the victim, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, academic problems, and even suicide (Pellegrini &amp; Long, 2002; Rivers, Poteat, Noret, &amp; Ashurst, 2009).</p><p></p><p>Scenario 3: Formulate Hypothesis</p><p>The following hypothesis can be formulated based on the research problem and the literature review: Bullying is a prevalent issue at ZNHS, and it has significant negative effects on students' academic and social development. Furthermore, factors such as lack of parental involvement, peer pressure, and socio-economic status contribute significantly to the problem of bullying in ZNHS.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 4: Design Research</p><p>The research design should aim to collect data on various aspects of bullying in ZNHS. The study will employ a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data. The research design will include the following steps:</p><p></p><p>1. Sampling: We will use a random sampling technique to select a representative sample of students from different grades at ZNHS.</p><p></p><p>2. Data Collection: We will use a survey questionnaire to collect data on various aspects of bullying, such as the frequency and types of bullying, the effects of bullying on victims, and the factors contributing to bullying.</p><p></p><p>3. Data Analysis: The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, such as chi-square tests and regression analysis, to determine the relationship between different variables.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 5: Collect Data</p><p>Data collection will involve administering the survey questionnaire to a sample of students at ZNHS. The questionnaire will include questions on the frequency and types of bullying experienced by students, the impact of bullying on their academic and social development, and the factors contributing to bullying.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 6: Analyze Data</p><p>After data collection, we will use descriptive statistics to summarize the data and analyze it using inferential statistics to test the research hypotheses. These techniques will help us to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 7: Interpret and Report </p><p>The interpretation of the findings and the report will present the results of the study in a clear and concise manner. Our findings may reveal the extent and the nature of bullying in ZNHS, its effects on the academic and social development of students, and the factors contributing to bullying. The report will provide recommendations to school administrators, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders to address and prevent bullying in ZNHS.  Overall, this research aims to promote a safe and inclusive learning environment for students, free from bullying and harassment.</p><br />
