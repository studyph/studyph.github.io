                                            As urban populations grow, the cities grow too, taking over more and more land. New houses, stores, and office buildings are built all the time. Land that was once forest or farms is now parking lots and apartment buildings. We seem to act as if we have unlimited land, but we don't. We need to plan more carefully so that we use our limited land in the best way possible. People need to respect Earth and try to preserve it. If we don't, we will lose all the natural resources that we depend on for life. Then what will happen?Thesis Statement:____________________3.In some business cultures, it is the practice to hire workers when they areyoung and employ them until they retire. In other business cultures, companies hire people to do a job and then fire them when they are not needed. I agree with the latter position. In today’s economy it is not important to hire employee’s performance speed, and ability to change. Loyalty is not a consideration. Because of competition, we also need to be able to produce our goods and services quickly. By changing our workforce frequently, we can bring in new ideas. By hiring young workers, we get fresh points of view. A company needs to keep up with the changing forces of the economy.Thesis Statement:_________________​</a>

                                            The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</a>

                                            Getting Even at the Back End 
Big rental players in the grocery industry have always enjoyed the best deals from its suppliers especially on pricing and terms. But with the near implementation of retail trade liberalization law and the continuous expansion of the big retail players, will our small-and medium-sized entities be burned soon with Goliath’s technology, clout, and expertise? Fortunately, our SME grocery retailers are not allowing itself to be left behind despite the limited resources it may have. In 1995, several medium-sized retailers have banded together to share common facilities and agreed to form Grocers Central Alliance Inc. (Grocent). Jose Albert is the brain behind it. Its incorporators believed in having a distribution center (DC) to promote efficiency and lower acquisition cost due to economies of scale. At the same time, Albert immediately envisioned the E-commerce side of the business and rolled it out for the benefit of its members. Through Grocent, members can avail of lower cost due to volume discounts, more efficient distribution, and higher availability of inventory due to buffer stocks in distribution center. It has lower investment in IT since they share the resources for the warehouse management system. It has a central warehouse complete with staff for warehouse management, distribution management, and purchasing. All the member companies pay a subscription fee and membership dues to sustain the operation of Grocent. Grocent's financial considerations based on cost benefit were hardware, software, and maintenance cost vs. substantial inventory reduction, lower documentation cost, plus speed and accuracy in serving customer orders. When Grocent started its system, it was all EDI but now it has decided to move on to an Internet-based solution. Grocent expects more competition especially with retail trade liberalization in the country. But the president is confident that Grocent members will be better positioned for competition in terms of stock availability and cost of acquisition. At present, Grocent has 47 grocery partners and 23 supplier partners. Only the multinationals are co-evolving with Grocent but its president, Cabochan, sees the need for local companies to get into the system. Trading partners are enthusiastic particularly those with the capability and are working on their systems to be able to link to Grocent. 
Question 01. Discuss how IT is helping Grocent not to be left behind by big retail players in the grocery industry. 
Question 02. Explain how IT is changing the way of doing business. 
Question 03. Give suggestions how Grocent can further enhance E-trading among members, suppliers, and customers.</a>

                                            The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</a>

•If they will find that their marketing is ineffective, they have the flexibility to change course rapidly.
•They have low overhead costs, allowing them to give clients a good deal.
WEAKNESSES:
Their business has a poor reputation and minimal market presence.
Their staff is small, and many of their skill sets are lacking.
They are susceptible to key personnel getting sick or quitting.

                            13. As urban populations grow, the cities grow too, taking over more and more land. New houses, stores, and office buildings are built all the time. Land that was once forest or farms is now parking lots and apartment buildings. We seem to act as if we have unlimited land, but we don't. We need to plan more carefully so that we use our limited land in the best way possible. People need to respect Earth and try to preserve it. If we don't, we will lose all the natural resources that we depend on for life. Then what will happen?Thesis Statement:____________________3.In some business cultures, it is the practice to hire workers when they areyoung and employ them until they retire. In other business cultures, companies hire people to do a job and then fire them when they are not needed. I agree with the latter position. In today’s economy it is not important to hire employee’s performance speed, and ability to change. Loyalty is not a consideration. Because of competition, we also need to be able to produce our goods and services quickly. By changing our workforce frequently, we can bring in new ideas. By hiring young workers, we get fresh points of view. A company needs to keep up with the changing forces of the economy.Thesis Statement:_________________​</h2><br />
                        One potential thesis statement could be: As urban populations continue to grow, it is important for us to carefully plan how we use our limited land in order to preserve natural resources and protect the Earth for future generations.One potential thesis statement could be: In today's economy, it is important for companies to prioritize flexibility and adaptability in their hiring practices in order to keep up with changing market forces and stay competitive. This can be achieved by hiring workers based on their performance, speed, and ability to change, rather than their loyalty, and by regularly bringing in new ideas through the hiring of younger workers.<br />

                            14. The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</h2><br />

                            20. Getting Even at the Back End 
Big rental players in the grocery industry have always enjoyed the best deals from its suppliers especially on pricing and terms. But with the near implementation of retail trade liberalization law and the continuous expansion of the big retail players, will our small-and medium-sized entities be burned soon with Goliath’s technology, clout, and expertise? Fortunately, our SME grocery retailers are not allowing itself to be left behind despite the limited resources it may have. In 1995, several medium-sized retailers have banded together to share common facilities and agreed to form Grocers Central Alliance Inc. (Grocent). Jose Albert is the brain behind it. Its incorporators believed in having a distribution center (DC) to promote efficiency and lower acquisition cost due to economies of scale. At the same time, Albert immediately envisioned the E-commerce side of the business and rolled it out for the benefit of its members. Through Grocent, members can avail of lower cost due to volume discounts, more efficient distribution, and higher availability of inventory due to buffer stocks in distribution center. It has lower investment in IT since they share the resources for the warehouse management system. It has a central warehouse complete with staff for warehouse management, distribution management, and purchasing. All the member companies pay a subscription fee and membership dues to sustain the operation of Grocent. Grocent's financial considerations based on cost benefit were hardware, software, and maintenance cost vs. substantial inventory reduction, lower documentation cost, plus speed and accuracy in serving customer orders. When Grocent started its system, it was all EDI but now it has decided to move on to an Internet-based solution. Grocent expects more competition especially with retail trade liberalization in the country. But the president is confident that Grocent members will be better positioned for competition in terms of stock availability and cost of acquisition. At present, Grocent has 47 grocery partners and 23 supplier partners. Only the multinationals are co-evolving with Grocent but its president, Cabochan, sees the need for local companies to get into the system. Trading partners are enthusiastic particularly those with the capability and are working on their systems to be able to link to Grocent. 
Question 01. Discuss how IT is helping Grocent not to be left behind by big retail players in the grocery industry. 
Question 02. Explain how IT is changing the way of doing business. 
Question 03. Give suggestions how Grocent can further enhance E-trading among members, suppliers, and customers.</h2><br />

                            23. The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</h2><br />
