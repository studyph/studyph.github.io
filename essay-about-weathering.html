                                            Philippines
is surrounded by large body of water and this is the reason why it is always
visited by typhoons. Just recently, Typhoon ULYSSES hit our country which
affected the lives of many Filipinos. Damages in crops, properties, and loss of
lives are just some of its effects to the community. Awareness and preparedness
in case of calamities can help save lives.
Why is it good to inform the children, family, and community about the weather
condition? Answer it by making an essay.

 If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs! Especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</a>

Informative Essay Wooden-hulled pump boats will always be one of Guimaras'icon - the easiest means of transportation in going to Iloilo City apart from the Roll-on- Roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels. Basically, it can accommodate 35 to 40 passengers from either Jordan or Buenavista wharves to Iloilo City and vice versa. Employees from Iloilo City working at Guimaras need not worry about getting late to school or to work since there is ease of access and availability of bancas or wooden boats, then. However, with the mass number of COVID-19 victims, and the toll getting higher still, the usual number of passengers were trimmed down into half yet, the conventional travel time of 15 to 20 minutes under falr weather conditions still stands true. Moreover, at the onset of 2021, these said motorboats are nowhere in sight since the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) did not renew their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). This heartbreaking move left almost 400 motorboat crews unemployed - lost their main source of income, in as much as their respective families are struggling for survival even in providing for their basic needs; 91 wooden-hulled boats were phased out. Questions: 1. What is the main topic? 2. Does the essay inform the reader? In what way? 3. Discuss the reasons why the informative writing technique was used by accomplishing the diagram below:​</a>

There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                            1. 100 Words Essay about Science Weathering​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Soft grounds are often the result of weathering. Weathering is the chemical and physical change in time of ground under influence of atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and nuclear radiation (temperature, rain, circulating groundwater, vegetation, etc.). Erosion is the removal of material on or below the Earth surface due to flowing (ground-) water, ice, and wind. Quantities of weathered material do not need to be large to change the geotechnical properties of a groundmass, for example, weathering of discontinuity walls that reduce the shear strength. Weathering is the reason for many constructions and other engineering applications in which ground is din used, to become a disaster. The processes involved in weathering are described briefly as well as the role of erosion in weathering and weathering depth. The dependence of weathering on lithology, implications for engineering applications, the methodology for describing and classification of weathering, and options for determining the susceptibility to weathering for forecasting future weathering are introduced. Hard layer or crust forming as result of weathering and tests for determining the state of weathering and susceptibility to weathering conclude the chapter.</p><p></p><p>Weathering is the change of ground materials under influence of the Earth atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and by nuclear radiation, mostly causing hard ground to become soft ground. Landslides and instable cut slopes are the most obvious results of weathering but also soil and rock in tunnels may weather and jeopardize tunnel stability. Completely buried ground below foundations of surface structures may weather due to percolating groundwater and air causing a gradual degradation of the geotechnical quality of the ground under a foundation. Under some conditions weathering may have a reverse effect and cause an increase in ground strength when forming 'hard' layers.</p><p></p><p>Weathering in most grounds is normally a fairly slow process taking long (geological) times to weather a large volume of ground, but it should be realized that small changes of very small quantities of material of a ground by weathering happening in a relatively short time span already may jeopardize an engineering construction. For example, the rock on both sides of a joint plane after excavation being exposed to a new environment may weather by a depth of tens of a millimeter in a couple of days, months, years after excavation. Then the shear strength of the joint plane may be significantly reduced due to weathering of the asperities on the joint plane and forming a thin layer of low shear strength infill material, e.g. clay, in the joint. Such reduction in shear strength is often enough to allow sliding of a rock block where that would not have been the case along the unweathered joint plane.</p><p></p><p>Weathering also allows 'loss of structure of ground. The geotechnical quality of ground is to a certain extent due to a tight structure of particles and blocks of ground material. The tightness of the structure is reduced if weathering causes removal of part of the material or reduces the strength of particles or blocks. The reduction in</p><p></p><p>sana po makatulong!!</p><p>pls mark me as a brain.liest,, tysm^^</p><p></p><br />

It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</h2><br />

Additionally, finding an activity that you enjoy can help to make exercise more enjoyable and increase your motivation.</p><p></p><p>Barrier 2: Lack of Time</p><p>Many people struggle with finding time to exercise. To overcome this barrier, it is important to prioritize exercise as a part of your daily routine. This can be achieved by scheduling exercise into your calendar, waking up earlier to exercise, or finding ways to exercise during your workday (such as taking a walk during your lunch break).

Additionally, finding a workout buddy or joining a group exercise class can help to provide support and motivation.</p><p></p><p>Barrier 4: Excuses about the Weather</p><p>Weather can be a common excuse for not exercising. To overcome this barrier, it is important to have a backup plan for exercising indoors, such as using a home workout video or going to a gym. Additionally, investing in proper workout gear, such as waterproof shoes or a warm jacket, can help to make exercising in different weather conditions more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Barrier 5: Feeling That Exercise Is Not Interesting at All</p><p>Many people find exercise boring or uninteresting. To overcome this barrier, it is important to find activities that you enjoy and that fit your personality and interests. This can include trying new activities, such as dancing or rock climbing, or finding ways to make your current workout more fun, such as listening to music or working out with a friend. It is also helpful to set goals and track your progress, as this can help to keep you motivated and interested in exercise.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>1. Lack of motivation: A lack of motivation is one of the most common barriers that people face when it comes to exercise. This can be due to many reasons, such as boredom, feeling uninspired, or a lack of confidence in one's abilities to succeed. To overcome this, it is essential to set achievable goals that are relevant to your interests and abilities. You can also find a workout buddy or join a group fitness class to keep yourself motivated and accountable, or use an app that tracks your progress and provides incentives.</p><p></p><p>2. Lack of time: Another common barrier is a lack of time. With busy schedules, it can be difficult to make time for exercise. To overcome this, you can try to schedule exercise into your daily routine by waking up earlier, taking a break at work to go for a walk, or finding little pockets of time throughout the day to do quick exercises like squats or lunges.</p><p></p><p>3. Not feeling well and not thinking that you are fit: Feeling sick or not believing in your physical ability to exercise can hinder your progress. However, it is essential to remember that exercise can actually help improve your physical and emotional health. Start small by doing low-impact exercises such as walking or yoga, and gradually build up your endurance.</p><p></p><p>4. Excuses about the Weather: External factors such as bad weather can be a significant barrier to exercise. However, you can overcome this by finding alternative indoor exercises such as dancing, lifting weights or cycling. You can also invest in some workout equipment or utilize online workouts that can be done at home.</p><p></p><p>5. Feeling that exercise is not interesting at all: If you find exercise boring, this can be a significant barrier. However, you can overcome this by finding activities that interest you. Whether it's rock climbing, dancing, or swimming, there are many ways to make exercise more enjoyable. You can also try different types of workouts, such as interval training or strength training, to add variety.</p><p></p><p>Overall, overcoming barriers to exercise requires commitment, creativity, and perseverance. With the right mindset and tools, it is possible to make exercise a regular part of your life.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />
