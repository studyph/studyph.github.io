                                            Why do you believe that the rule you selected would work best in a virtual classroom?
List of options:
- The teachers will only give activities within their subject, And the students will only ask within the school day.
- No activities or virtual meetings during weekends.
- You can turn on the camera but not the whole period for privacy reasons and unstable connections.
- Allow the students to comply with the missing activities by giving them a completion week.
- Only give activities within the asynchronous time.
- Avoid switching the schedule of asynchronous and synchronous class.
- Consider "mental health issues" as an acceptable reason for missing virtual classes.</a>
