                                            Directions: Read the passage and provide an answer to the question below.     PASSAGE:  Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy   By Sara Goudarzi      If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."  Teen thinking   In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"  Developing sensitivity  Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.        Question:   Why did the author mention ‘hormonal shift’ in the article?   Select one: a. to validate the claim of the research on teens’ behavior in relation to their brain development b. to persuade us to conduct research on teens’ behavior. c. to present the conclusion of the article. d. to make fun of the teenagers</a>

Supporting details, major and minor, support the main idea by telling how, what, when, where. why, how much, or how many 7. Explicit details are the details that we can't really see and are used to describe a general state 8. Implicit details are the details that we can see and are measurable. These details are stated clearly. 9. Making inference is predicting information from a given text10. Inference is a reasonable conclusion from a given information. 11. Inference is the technique of finding answers from clues and from prior knowledge. 12. Readers who make inferences do not use the clues in the text to figure out the meaning 13. A paraphrase is a shortened version or a gist of a longer story 14. Summarizing is expressing ideas on your own words to make a passage easier to understand 15.

WHEN, WHERE, WHY.Climate ChangeClimate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different from weatherbecause it is measured over a long period of time, whereas weather can change from day today, or from year to year. The climate of an area includes seasonal temperature and rainfallaverages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates. A desert, for example.isreferred to as an arid climate because little waterfalls, as rain or snow, during the year. Othertypes of climate include tropical climates, which are hot and humid, and temperate climates,which have warm summers and cooler winters.Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patternsin a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole Chimatechange may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patternscan make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming becauseexpected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on Climate change has alsobeen connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intensehurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter stormsIn polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change havemeant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. Thiscontributes to sea levels rising in different regions of the planet. Together with expanding oceanwaters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to damage coastlinesas a result of increased flooding and erosion.KATULOY NYA PO YUNH NASA PICTURE​</a>

Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlor watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and when she came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.

Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.      
Question:
Why did the author mention about the medial prefrontal cortex? 
Select one:
a. to reject the research study
b. to explain the part of the brain responsible for teens’ behavior
c. to compare adult and teen
d. to encourage us to take care of our brain

Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
 By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role.

Other por climate inchide cropical climates, which are hot and hund, and temperate climates, which have warm summers and cooler winters Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patterns can make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming because expected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on Climate change has also been connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms. In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change have Guant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes to sea levels rising in different regions of the planet. Together with expanding ocean waters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to damage coastlines s a result of increased flooding and erosion.

Read the following passages. Then, write your own paragraphs showing your understanding of the passages using both paraphrasing and quoting. Your paragraphs should be written in no less than 250 words. Passage 1 Excerpt from “Divining the Witch of York: Propaganda and Prophecy” by Ed Simon, published on October 24, 2018 In 1488 during the reign of Henry VII, one year after the Dominican Heinrich Kramer wrote his notorious witch-finding manual Malleus Maleficarum, an adolescent girl named Agatha Soothtell gave birth in a cave among the dales and moors of Yorkshire to her daughter Ursula, supposedly conceived by the Devil himself. Ironically it was there in “God’s Own Country” that young Agatha would raise her demonic charge, both of them forced to live in the cave where Ursula was born. The site that would be visited by pilgrims for centuries afterwards, making it arguably England’s first tourist attraction, was known as much for the strange calcifying waters of its subterranean whirlpool as for its medieval Satanic nativity. Most sources claimed that Ursula died during the rule of Elizabeth I in 1561, but with eight decades separating her supposed death and the first appearance of her name in print, it’s fair to assume a degree of invention in her biography. Despite her legendary ugliness (Ursula’s seventeenth-century biographer described her as “a thing so strange in an infant, that no age can parallel”1), at the age of twenty-four she married a carpenter named Toby Shipton, and it is to posterity that she would come to be known as “Mother Shipton”. A less appropriate surname, because as “Smith” and “Taylor” indicate profession, so too did “Soothtell”. Mother Shipton would become the most famed of soothe tellers in Englishhistory, renowned for her prophecies and used as a symbolic familiar in the art ofdivination for generations, the very constructed personage of the seer, a work of poetryunto herself. As scholar Darren Oldridge writes, “Unlike other ‘ancient prophets’ who wereknown by their words alone, Shipton emerged as a personality in her own right”.It is likely at least some of Mother Shipton’s predictions were invented long after she lived,her prophetic couplets revised and edited to conform to later events, whether CardinalWolsey’s death, the Great Fire of London, or the Crimean War. Details of her biography, herwriting, and her very countenance are uncertain. The prophetess herself may have been alater invention. Yet Mother Shipton, England’s Nostradamus, the sixteenth-century Sibyl,the Yorkshire prophetess, the Knaresborough witch whose crooked face has stared outfrom prints hanging on occultist’s walls and in the names of country pubs since the initialprinting of her predictions in 1641, should serve as a potent point of reflection for whatexactly we talk about when we talk about prophecies.​</a>

                            5. Directions: Read the passage and provide an answer to the question below.     PASSAGE:  Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy   By Sara Goudarzi      If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."  Teen thinking   In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"  Developing sensitivity  Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.        Question:   Why did the author mention ‘hormonal shift’ in the article?   Select one: a. to validate the claim of the research on teens’ behavior in relation to their brain development b. to persuade us to conduct research on teens’ behavior. c. to present the conclusion of the article. d. to make fun of the teenagers</h2><br />

WHEN, WHERE, WHY.Climate ChangeClimate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different from weatherbecause it is measured over a long period of time, whereas weather can change from day today, or from year to year. The climate of an area includes seasonal temperature and rainfallaverages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates. A desert, for example.isreferred to as an arid climate because little waterfalls, as rain or snow, during the year. Othertypes of climate include tropical climates, which are hot and humid, and temperate climates,which have warm summers and cooler winters.Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patternsin a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole Chimatechange may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. These unexpected weather patternscan make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on farming becauseexpected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on Climate change has alsobeen connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intensehurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter stormsIn polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change havemeant ice sheets and glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate from season to season.

Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlor watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and when she came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.

Study :  Teenage brain lacks empathy
By Sara Goudarzi
If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)."
Teen thinking
In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'"
Developing sensitivity
Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.      
Question:
Why did the author mention about the medial prefrontal cortex?

This means that we need to remember the important waysto put into action. 4.) or course, the first thing to do is to reflect not inthoughtlessness but we need to start to focus and analyze the competition takingplace between the positive and negative limits of our emotions. 5.) Eventually weask "How do we feel about the challenge?" 6.) Do we hopeless, angry, jealous,worried, inadequate, insecure, fearful or do we feel their negative counterparts? 7.]It's silly to allow them to overrule our outlook in life. 8.) We must envision alwaysthat progress and success come to those adhere to practice hardwork,determination, courage, perseverance, humility, consciousness, justice, self-confidence, trust, respect, love and other potent secrets of inner strength andsuccess. 9.) We need to be realistic that we need some if not all of them to turnchallenges to opportunities; thereby this will make us all contented and happy,1.

PASSAGE: Study : Teenage brain lacks empathy By Sara Goudarzi If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)." Teen thinking In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'" Developing sensitivity Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK. Question: What is the dominant feeling of the author in his article?

At the end of the activity, the learners should be able to determine which of the author’s words can be quoted and which ones should be paraphrased to support the main idea. Read the following passages. Then, write your own paragraphs showing your understanding of the passages using both paraphrasing and quoting. Your paragraphs should be written in no less than 250 words. Passage 1 Excerpt from “Divining the Witch of York: Propaganda and Prophecy” by Ed Simon, published on October 24, 2018 In 1488 during the reign of Henry VII, one year after the Dominican Heinrich Kramer wrote his notorious witch-finding manual Malleus Maleficarum, an adolescent girl named Agatha Soothtell gave birth in a cave among the dales and moors of Yorkshire to her daughter Ursula, supposedly conceived by the Devil himself. Ironically it was there in “God’s Own Country” that young Agatha would raise her demonic charge, both of them forced to live in the cave where Ursula was born. The site that would be visited by pilgrims for centuries afterwards, making it arguably England’s first tourist attraction, was known as much for the strange calcifying waters of its subterranean whirlpool as for its medieval Satanic nativity. Most sources claimed that Ursula died during the rule of Elizabeth I in 1561, but with eight decades separating her supposed death and the first appearance of her name in print, it’s fair to assume a degree of invention in her biography. Despite her legendary ugliness (Ursula’s seventeenth-century biographer described her as “a thing so strange in an infant, that no age can parallel”1), at the age of twenty-four she married a carpenter named Toby Shipton, and it is to posterity that she would come to be known as “Mother Shipton”. A less appropriate surname, because as “Smith” and “Taylor” indicate profession, so too did “Soothtell”. Mother Shipton would become the most famed of soothe tellers in Englishhistory, renowned for her prophecies and used as a symbolic familiar in the art ofdivination for generations, the very constructed personage of the seer, a work of poetryunto herself. As scholar Darren Oldridge writes, “Unlike other ‘ancient prophets’ who wereknown by their words alone, Shipton emerged as a personality in her own right”.It is likely at least some of Mother Shipton’s predictions were invented long after she lived,her prophetic couplets revised and edited to conform to later events, whether CardinalWolsey’s death, the Great Fire of London, or the Crimean War. Details of her biography, herwriting, and her very countenance are uncertain. The prophetess herself may have been alater invention. Yet Mother Shipton, England’s Nostradamus, the sixteenth-century Sibyl,the Yorkshire prophetess, the Knaresborough witch whose crooked face has stared outfrom prints hanging on occultist’s walls and in the names of country pubs since the initialprinting of her predictions in 1641, should serve as a potent point of reflection for whatexactly we talk about when we talk about prophecies.​</h2><br />

Despite her legendary ugliness, she married a carpenter named Toby Shipton at the age of twenty-four, and from then on, she became known as “Mother Shipton” instead of “Soothtell”.
