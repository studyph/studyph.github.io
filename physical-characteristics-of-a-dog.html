                                            Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

                            8. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

You interviewed your parents to know what they would buy when they are awarded a million pesos. They told you that they would buy your own house and consistent food supply.Column BA. Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />
