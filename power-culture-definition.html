The State of Pinoy Pop: 2016
by Ian Uruttia
Take it from someone who has been monitoring the latest Filipino releases for a music website since 2012: 2016 is shaping up to be a good one for Pinoy pop. Never mind that we subscribe to an industry mandate awarding albums that sold 15,000 copies a platinum certification. Disregard the fact that our growing interest in cultural nostalgia has immortalized The Eraserheads, MYMP and Nina in the upper echelon of the Spotify and iTunes music charts, preventing the latest crop of local singles and albums from getting a higher placement. If we ignore the status of commercial releases in terms of fiscal performance and impact, then we might see things from a different perspective, and hopefully in a better light.
For one, major record labels have been decimated by the decline of physical sales and the surging prominence of digital consumption. Even the stakeholders from the Philippine Association of Recording Industry (PARI) no longer hold power in the affairs of the local music industry: Awit Awards, the board’s award-giving body, has become an uneventful showcase of old guard prestige, tricking the public into thinking it’s our version of The Grammys when it doesn’t even act like one.</a>

Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

The State of Pinoy Pop: 2016
by Ian Uruttia
Take it from someone who has been monitoring the latest Filipino releases for a music website since 2012: 2016 is shaping up to be a good one for Pinoy pop. Never mind that we subscribe to an industry mandate awarding albums that sold 15,000 copies a platinum certification. Disregard the fact that our growing interest in cultural nostalgia has immortalized The Eraserheads, MYMP and Nina in the upper echelon of the Spotify and iTunes music charts, preventing the latest crop of local singles and albums from getting a higher placement. If we ignore the status of commercial releases in terms of fiscal performance and impact, then we might see things from a different perspective, and hopefully in a better light.
For one, major record labels have been decimated by the decline of physical sales and the surging prominence of digital consumption. Even the stakeholders from the Philippine Association of Recording Industry (PARI) no longer hold power in the affairs of the local music industry: Awit Awards, the board’s award-giving body, has become an uneventful showcase of old guard prestige, tricking the public into thinking it’s our version of The Grammys when it doesn’t even act like one.</h2><br />

Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.
