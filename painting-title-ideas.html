The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                        LOST IN HOMELAND<p>"Lost in <strong>Homeland</strong>" is a video poem by Rossane Nurfarida that depicts the feelings of displacement and uncertainty experienced by a person who is lost in their own <strong>homeland</strong>. Through the imagery of a boat without a mast, drifting aimlessly in the water, the author raises awareness of the challenges faced by those who are displaced and the political situation of the Rohingya refugees.</p><p></p>ANSWERSThe author feels a sense of displacement and uncertainty with the idea of being lost in their homeland.The author paints a picture of a lost individual through the imagery of a boat without a mast, drifting aimlessly in the water, with no sense of direction or destination.The poet's tone is somber and melancholic, reflecting the feelings of the lost individual and the plight of the Rohingya refugees.The message of the poem seems to be the idea of being lost, both physically and metaphorically, in one's own homeland, and the struggles and challenges that come with that experience.The author describes the political situation of the Rohingya as being without a destination, and with no sense of direction, echoing the idea of being lost.The title "Lost in Homeland" suggests a feeling of being lost or disoriented in one's own homeland, which can be both a physical and metaphorical experience.If one were in this situation, they may feel a sense of displacement, uncertainty, and a lack of belonging. What one would do in response to these feelings would depend on their individual circumstances and resources.There is no clear solution presented in the poem, but the author raises awareness of the struggles and challenges faced by those who are lost or displaced in their own homeland.<p></p><p>https://brainly.in/question/35789943 </p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.
