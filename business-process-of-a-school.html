                                            SHORT CASE STUDY
 You are the Manager of "Best Learning Center," a tutoring and mentoring school which you put up a year ago in Manila, in partnership with two lady friends, Hope and Lorie. They are both government scholars and have graduated last year with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education, major in Physics.
 Before you formed the learning center, you developed a one-year financial plan for the learning center. The initial one year test run of the business has elapsed and you decided to spend a one day business retreat with them. Since you will be taking the lead role you thought that the best way to do it is to apply the "Measuring Results" process.
 But even before the meeting, your partners advanced the following encouraging information about the results of last year's operation.
From Lorie, the company treasurer - revenues for the year totalled P360,000 (90% of the annual target), money on hand and in bank is P160,000.
From Hope, the operations manager - about 40 students mentees registered for mentoring during the year and she has been continuously receiving queries.
 While you were preparing the agenda, it occurred to you that perhaps the original financial plan format to guide the business for the next three to five years. So you decided to expand the meeting agenda to include discussion on the non-financial or the operational aspects of the business. How would then your agenda look like? Explain.</a>

</p><p>Despite strong agreement on the importance of parent 
</p><p>involvement, most schools, districts, and states still need help in 
</p><p>developing comprehensive programs of school, family, and community 
</p><p>partnerships. This revised handbook translates lessons learned over 20 years 
</p><p>of research and fieldwork into practical solutions for program development. 
</p><p>The book presents a research-based framework and field-tested tools to help 
</p><p>leaders understand six types of family and community involvement; create an 
</p><p>Action Team for Partnerships; plan and implement family and community 
</p><p>involvement activities to reach school goals for student success; mobilize 
</p><p>community resources; encourage progress; evaluate resul'ts; and continue to 
</p><p>improve plans, practices, and programs over time. Chapter 1 summarizes the 
</p><p>theory and research on which the handbook is based. Chapter 2 provides 
</p><p>examples illustrating how the approach works in various schools and 
</p><p>communities. Chapter 3 provides guidance in organizing an effective Action 
</p><p>Team for Partnerships. Chapter 4 supplies materials to help workshop leaders 
</p><p>prepare workshops for educators, parents, and community partners. Chapter 5 
</p><p>supplies charts and diagrams that can be used as transparencies and handouts 
</p><p>in presentations and workshops. Chapter 6 summarizes research and practical 
</p><p>approaches to family and community involvement in secondary schools. Chapter 
</p><p>7 outlines state and district leadership activities to increase expertise on 
</p><p>school, family, and community partnerships. Chapter 8 describes two 
</p><p>partnership approaches as part of the Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork 
</p><p>(TIPS) approach. Chapter 9 includes tools for developing long-term goals, 
</p><p>writing action plans, conducting evaluations, and assessing partnership 
</p><p>progress. Chapter 10 shows how to join other schools, districts, and states

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The research question "What are the attitudes people with stroke towards the daily use of assistive devices and technologies?" is an example of a qualitative research question that aims to explore the experiences, perspectives, and attitudes of a specific group of individuals. This question would likely be addressed through qualitative methods such as interviews or focus groups, allowing researchers to gather rich, detailed data on participants' beliefs, values, and experiences related to assistive devices and technologies.</p><p>2.The research question "What role does the therapist's spirituality play in the treatment of his or her patient?" is another example of a qualitative research question that seeks to explore the experiences and perspectives of a specific group of individuals. In this case, the question focuses on the role of a therapist's personal beliefs and spirituality in their interactions with patients.

                            24. SHORT CASE STUDY
 You are the Manager of "Best Learning Center," a tutoring and mentoring school which you put up a year ago in Manila, in partnership with two lady friends, Hope and Lorie. They are both government scholars and have graduated last year with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education, major in Physics.
 Before you formed the learning center, you developed a one-year financial plan for the learning center. The initial one year test run of the business has elapsed and you decided to spend a one day business retreat with them. Since you will be taking the lead role you thought that the best way to do it is to apply the "Measuring Results" process.
 But even before the meeting, your partners advanced the following encouraging information about the results of last year's operation.
From Lorie, the company treasurer - revenues for the year totalled P360,000 (90% of the annual target), money on hand and in bank is P160,000.
From Hope, the operations manager - about 40 students mentees registered for mentoring during the year and she has been continuously receiving queries.
 While you were preparing the agenda, it occurred to you that perhaps the original financial plan format to guide the business for the next three to five years. So you decided to expand the meeting agenda to include discussion on the non-financial or the operational aspects of the business. How would then your agenda look like? Explain.</h2><br />
