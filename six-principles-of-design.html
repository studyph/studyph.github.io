                                            LEARNING ACTIVITY: As a summary,patterns are regular,repeated,or recurring forms or designs. Patterns are commonly observed in natural objects,such as six-fold symmetry of snowflakes,the hexagonal structure and formation of honeycombs,the tiger's stripes and hyna's spots, the number of seeds in a sunflower ,the spiral of a snail's shell, and the number of petals of flowers,Humans are hard wired to recognize patterns and studying them,we discovered the underlying mathematical principles behind nature's design.

On the space provided, write one principle or element that you have seen.​EXPLANATION: Elements of design are the components or part which can be secluded and defined in any visual design or work of art. They form and carry the work. The following are the seven basic elements of design.  Point (mark) is the smallest and most basic element.  Line is a path of moving point.  Shape is a shape is formed when a line encloses an area.  Forms is a three - dimensional object. It occupies space or gives illusion that it occupies space.  Space is the illusion of objects having depth on the two – dimensional surface – linear and aerial perspective are used. Color has three properties; the first is hue, which is the name of the colors, second is the value, which refers to the lightness or darkness of hue, last is the intensity, which refers to the purity of the hue also known as “Chroma”.  Texture refers to the surface quality, both replicated and actual of artwork. Principles of design are the artistic recommendations used to organize or arrange the structural elements of design. The following are the six basic principles of design.  Balance includes the symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial in the artwork.  Rhythm or movement is the regular repetition of the elements of art to create a sense of rhythm and/ or movement.  Emphasis refers to give special attention to one part of a work of art.  Contrast refers to the juxtaposition of different elements of design (e.g. rough and smooth textures, dark and light values) in place to highlight their differences or create visual interest and focal point.  Unity enables the design to be seen as one complete piece of art or design.</a>

                            8. Below are the pictures that show the principle and element of design. On the space provided, write one principle or element that you have seen.​EXPLANATION: Elements of design are the components or part which can be secluded and defined in any visual design or work of art. They form and carry the work. The following are the seven basic elements of design.  Point (mark) is the smallest and most basic element.  Line is a path of moving point.  Shape is a shape is formed when a line encloses an area.  Forms is a three - dimensional object. It occupies space or gives illusion that it occupies space.  Space is the illusion of objects having depth on the two – dimensional surface – linear and aerial perspective are used. Color has three properties; the first is hue, which is the name of the colors, second is the value, which refers to the lightness or darkness of hue, last is the intensity, which refers to the purity of the hue also known as “Chroma”.  Texture refers to the surface quality, both replicated and actual of artwork. Principles of design are the artistic recommendations used to organize or arrange the structural elements of design. The following are the six basic principles of design.  Balance includes the symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial in the artwork.  Rhythm or movement is the regular repetition of the elements of art to create a sense of rhythm and/ or movement.  Emphasis refers to give special attention to one part of a work of art.  Contrast refers to the juxtaposition of different elements of design (e.g. rough and smooth textures, dark and light values) in place to highlight their differences or create visual interest and focal point.  Unity enables the design to be seen as one complete piece of art or design.</h2><br />
