                        <p><strong>10 things I believe in the context of religion.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Embracing a <strong>religion </strong>oftentimes equals believing in its system of beliefs. There are numerous religions in the whole world, and choosing one is a person's right. Usually, though, we are born with one thanks to our parents' lineage. All religions teach compassion and humanity, and most of the time as long as everyone gets along fine, then it is also fine in the context of religion.</p><p><strong>Since I am a Muslim, here are 10 things I believe in:</strong></p><strong>I believe in</strong> One True God, and there is no other than Him, as well as Mohammed as His prophet.<strong>I also believe</strong> in an afterlife because a Muslim should believe in one, as well as many other things.<strong>I believe</strong> that Quran is a direct word from God and that Islam is the true religion among others.<strong>I believe</strong> that I must live while taking Islamic values in mind at all times.<strong>I believe</strong> that hell and heaven exist, and it is by God's mercy that we will enter heaven someday.<strong>I believe</strong> that doing good deeds towards our parents will be rewarded accordingly.<strong>I believe</strong> in the fact that this world is only temporary and is very short compared to the future world of the afterlife.<strong>I believe</strong> that we all must try to be good people throughout, towards other humans as well as other God's creations on this earth.<strong>I believe</strong> in the five pillars of Islam as the foundation of my faith.<strong>I believe</strong> that being born a Muslim is the greatest blessing in my life.<p>That sums up my beliefs as a Muslim, there are of course many more, but I think that would suffice as a summary.</p><p>Learn more about <strong>other people's personal beliefs </strong>by referring to brainly.ph/question/10783747</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />
