Transcript of Miss Universe Q &amp; A Question: What is the most important lesson you've learned in your life, and how would you apply it to your time as Miss Universe? Catriona Gray: I work a lot in the slums of Tondo, Manila, and the life there is very poor and very sad. I've always taught myself to look for the beauty in it, to look for the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful. I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situations with a silver lining, and to assess where I could give something, where I could provide something as a spokesperson. If I could teach also people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children would have a smile on their face. Thank you. 2.

Transcript of Miss Universe Q &amp; A Question: What is the most important lesson you've learned in your life, and how would you apply it to your time as Miss Universe? Catriona Gray: I work a lot in the slums of Tondo, Manila, and the life there is very poor and very sad. I've always taught myself to look for the beauty in it, to look for the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful. I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situations with a silver lining, and to assess where I could give something, where I could provide something as a spokesperson. If I could teach also people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children would have a smile on their face. Thank you. 2.

Finally, his father decided to use this as an opportunity to teach him an important investing lesson. He called Karl and told him that he was ready to consider his plea. He gave him 2 options to choose from:Option A: I will increase your pocket money by 20% if you obtain an average grade of90% and above in your upcoming exams. However, if your average grade falls below. 90%, your pocket money will be reduced by 15%.Option B: Your pocket money will be increased by 5% effective immediately and will not depend on how you score in your exams.(https://finpeg.com/blog/risk-return-tradeoff/)Question:1. If you are Karl, which option would you choose? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I will choose option A</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Because it is better than option B, In option A I just need to passed my exam to get a 20% increase of my pocket money, not just like option B which he will gave me 5% increase of my pocket money without condition. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO :)</p><br />
