                                            The following is a part of a literature review from the study of Avilla (2012) entitled “On Life, Music and Meanings: An Ethnographic Account of a Blind Street Musician.”DIRECTIONS: Read the selection provided below and answer the guide questions that follow. Use your own words and write your answers on a separate word file and submit it via LMS.Music is melodic; it moves the passions (for good or ill) and is a fundamental human activity affecting our emotions by being stirring and martial, or beautiful and enticing. Its purposes could thus be considered as aligned with those of the science of rhetoric, which aimed to bend human minds and actions to the purposes of the orator. On the other side, music, in the theories erected on the basis of the laws of number and could thus be viewed as reflecting abstract and immanent of the universe such as the principles of natural order, or the workings of the divine (James, 1993 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolber, 2008).This is the dichotomous view of music that persisted until the first millennium. However, in the medieval world, music can be thought of as having meaning in at least two domains, the human and the divine. The domains now possessed quite different values; that which was oriented towards the divine has immeasurably higher value than that which was merely secular or bodily. At the extreme, it was not so much music as the theory of music that had meaning in the sphere of the divine order or cosmos in its proportions and forms could be allowed as having meaning in the appropriate domain (Sparshott &amp; Goehr, 2001 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).Music came to be seen as a foundationally human activity with its values and its meanings requiring to be expressed and interpreted in human rather than in divine forms (Palisca, 1985 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008). Music’s meanings were bound to the product and processes of human reason as well as to the music’s effects on human emotions, allowing for the possibility that music might express of bear types of meanings that were proper only to music as an art (Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).GUIDE QUESTIONS:1. What do you think is the study all about?2. What constructs or theme can you draw from the excerpt?3. What citation did the author use?

                            21. The following is a part of a literature review from the study of Avilla (2012) entitled “On Life, Music and Meanings: An Ethnographic Account of a Blind Street Musician.”DIRECTIONS: Read the selection provided below and answer the guide questions that follow. Use your own words and write your answers on a separate word file and submit it via LMS.Music is melodic; it moves the passions (for good or ill) and is a fundamental human activity affecting our emotions by being stirring and martial, or beautiful and enticing. Its purposes could thus be considered as aligned with those of the science of rhetoric, which aimed to bend human minds and actions to the purposes of the orator. On the other side, music, in the theories erected on the basis of the laws of number and could thus be viewed as reflecting abstract and immanent of the universe such as the principles of natural order, or the workings of the divine (James, 1993 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolber, 2008).This is the dichotomous view of music that persisted until the first millennium. However, in the medieval world, music can be thought of as having meaning in at least two domains, the human and the divine. The domains now possessed quite different values; that which was oriented towards the divine has immeasurably higher value than that which was merely secular or bodily. At the extreme, it was not so much music as the theory of music that had meaning in the sphere of the divine order or cosmos in its proportions and forms could be allowed as having meaning in the appropriate domain (Sparshott &amp; Goehr, 2001 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).Music came to be seen as a foundationally human activity with its values and its meanings requiring to be expressed and interpreted in human rather than in divine forms (Palisca, 1985 as cited in Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008). Music’s meanings were bound to the product and processes of human reason as well as to the music’s effects on human emotions, allowing for the possibility that music might express of bear types of meanings that were proper only to music as an art (Cross &amp; Tolbert, 2008).GUIDE QUESTIONS:1. What do you think is the study all about?2. What constructs or theme can you draw from the excerpt?3. What citation did the author use?
