In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​​</a>

Write the numbers on the lines before each step. || Lay down fabric fiat on the table and position the different pattern pieces. You must take note of the grain line or design of the cloth. Sew pieces together to form the shape or design wanted. Start with a sketch, drawing, or a photographic image of a linen product or clothing scaled into the desired size you want. Pin the pattern on the cloth and start tracing. Using correct measurements, scale the sketch or drawing on the pat-term paper. The linens and curves determine how the article or clothing is broken down into sections. Cut the patterns paper to achieve the actual shape and size of the different parts of the product. We call these pattern pieces templates that can be used in mass production. Pattern can be modified on the original template to achieve the necessary size you want. You can make it smaller or bigger by just decreasing or increasing the scale. Mark the needed allowances for sewing. Cut the fabric on the lines for allowance.100 point​</a>

(Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​</a>

                            15. a. 18. What's fact about detail drawing? Detail drawings are created on standard paper sizes. b. A detail drawing provides a detailed description of an object. A detail drawing is a tool used by engineers to communicate their designs to manufacturers and to preserve their work for future generations. d. All of the choices are correct. C.I. TRUE or FALSE Instruction: Write the whole word TRUE if you agree with the statement while FALSE if not. Write your answer on the blank space provided. (Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​​</h2><br />

Pin the pattern on the cloth and start tracing. Using correct measurements, scale the sketch or drawing on the pat-term paper. The linens and curves determine how the article or clothing is broken down into sections. Cut the patterns paper to achieve the actual shape and size of the different parts of the product. We call these pattern pieces templates that can be used in mass production. Pattern can be modified on the original template to achieve the necessary size you want. You can make it smaller or bigger by just decreasing or increasing the scale. Mark the needed allowances for sewing. Cut the fabric on the lines for allowance.100 point​</h2><br />

(Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​</h2><br />
