                                            Can you hear me now! Do you know that every year, 18.7 million of acres of forest is lost? That's more than 20 million football fields. So many forests are being cut down and it's making the planet sick and posing threat to life on Earth. Cutting down trees releases all the carbon dioxide they once stored. Carbon dioxide is a STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES greenhouse gas which traps heat from the Sun close to Earth's surface, causing global temperatures to rise and bringing about a process known as climate change. Fewer trees also mean less rainfall and more drought, and many more animals and plants will face extinction as their homes are destroyed. People can be taught the value of forests and the importance of caring for them and all life on planet earth. Being educated means to gather all the facts before making decision. We hope that the facts are considered before making a decision. We should all be responsible for taking good care of the earth.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3.

The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower.

                                            Why Duterte must own up to the Philippines’ COVID-19 disaster
Richard Heydrian is an Asia-based academic, columnist and author of “The
Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy” and the ‘ The Indo-
Pacific: Trump, China and the New Struggle for Global Mastery.”
No stranger to crisis and natural disasters, the Philippines’ response to
major calamities has long been hampered by weak institutions and a notoriously
corrupt bureaucracy. But President Rodrigo Duterte’s disastrous management of
the COVID-19 pandemic has struck a new low.
After imposing one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns enforced by
the military, the Philippines stands out as one of the region’s hot spots.
In many ways, this was a disaster waiting to happen. Elected on the promise
of bringing about “real change.’ Duterte’s populist crisis management style has
been bedeviled by a toxic combination of erratic leadership and authoritarian
excess.
Despite the strenuous efforts of top officials to downplay the crisis, the
Philippines’ number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has surpassed even far more
populous nations such as China and Indonesia. Among Asia-Pacific countries, only
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have it worse.
And thanks to an overly strict lockdown which shuttered up to 75% of
economic activity- but still failed to halt the spread of the virus- Philippines just
posted its worst quarterly economic performance on record, with the economy
shrinking 16.5% in the three months to end of June compared to robust growth of
5.4% for the same period last year.
7
The impact on everyday life has been severe with recent Department of Trade
and Industry survey showing that up to a third of businesses had been forced to
close down and unemployment reaching a historic high of 17.7% in April.
Many cities now forced back into even stricter lockdowns after the surge in
coronavirus cases and its far from clear how the Philippine economy will rebound
as the unprecedented magnitude that has overwhelmed the country’s health care
system and wipe out decades worth of gains poverty and underemployment.

                            4. Can you hear me now! Do you know that every year, 18.7 million of acres of forest is lost? That's more than 20 million football fields. So many forests are being cut down and it's making the planet sick and posing threat to life on Earth. Cutting down trees releases all the carbon dioxide they once stored. Carbon dioxide is a STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES greenhouse gas which traps heat from the Sun close to Earth's surface, causing global temperatures to rise and bringing about a process known as climate change. Fewer trees also mean less rainfall and more drought, and many more animals and plants will face extinction as their homes are destroyed. People can be taught the value of forests and the importance of caring for them and all life on planet earth. Being educated means to gather all the facts before making decision. We hope that the facts are considered before making a decision. We should all be responsible for taking good care of the earth.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3.

The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5.

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman.“A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />

                            9. Why Duterte must own up to the Philippines’ COVID-19 disaster
Richard Heydrian is an Asia-based academic, columnist and author of “The
Rise of Duterte: A Populist Revolt Against Elite Democracy” and the ‘ The Indo-
Pacific: Trump, China and the New Struggle for Global Mastery.”
No stranger to crisis and natural disasters, the Philippines’ response to
major calamities has long been hampered by weak institutions and a notoriously
corrupt bureaucracy. But President Rodrigo Duterte’s disastrous management of
the COVID-19 pandemic has struck a new low.
After imposing one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns enforced by
the military, the Philippines stands out as one of the region’s hot spots.
In many ways, this was a disaster waiting to happen. Elected on the promise
of bringing about “real change.’ Duterte’s populist crisis management style has
been bedeviled by a toxic combination of erratic leadership and authoritarian
excess.
Despite the strenuous efforts of top officials to downplay the crisis, the
Philippines’ number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has surpassed even far more
populous nations such as China and Indonesia. Among Asia-Pacific countries, only
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have it worse.
And thanks to an overly strict lockdown which shuttered up to 75% of
economic activity- but still failed to halt the spread of the virus- Philippines just
posted its worst quarterly economic performance on record, with the economy
shrinking 16.5% in the three months to end of June compared to robust growth of
5.4% for the same period last year.
7
The impact on everyday life has been severe with recent Department of Trade
and Industry survey showing that up to a third of businesses had been forced to
close down and unemployment reaching a historic high of 17.7% in April.
Many cities now forced back into even stricter lockdowns after the surge in
coronavirus cases and its far from clear how the Philippine economy will rebound
as the unprecedented magnitude that has overwhelmed the country’s health care
system and wipe out decades worth of gains poverty and underemployment.

At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan has urged President Marcos to appoint a permanent Department of Health (DOH) secretary. Libanan believes that this is necessary in order to lead the country in its fight against the COVID-19 virus and its potential new, deadlier variants. He noted that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire is currently only serving as "officer-in-charge" of the DOH. Libanan also believes that the Philippines has the potential to become a global medical hub like Singapore. He called for effective public-private partnerships and tax incentives to attract international medical schools and research facilities to the country.<p></p><br />

                            12. lawmakers urges marcos to name permanent doh chief Circle the past perfect tense and underline the simple past tense pls need ko answer pls po pls need.It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman.“A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />
