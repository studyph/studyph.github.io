After warming up, you can go to the restaurant and enjoy a buffet breakfast. During the day there are many activities which you can try. Dog sledding and snowmobiling are two of the most popular activities. There are other activities including snowshoe hiking, ice fishing, ice sculpting and kick-sledding. True or False: 1. The Ice Hotel can be found in Sweden. 2. The hotel is made of wood. 3.The temperature outside is -5 degrees. 4. Dog sledding is a popular activity for guests. 5. The hotel has 100 rooms.

The hotel melts in the summer and is rebuilt each winter.It can host over 100 guests. You sleep inside a warm thermal sleeping bag on a special bed built from snow and ice. You will need to pack thermal clothing and wear lots of warm layers. The temperature will be 5 degrees in your room. Betweeen the bedding and the layers of cloth, most guests do not feel any cold during the night.A staff member will wake you in the morning with a cup of hot juice. After warming up you can go to the restaurant and enjoy a buffet breakfast.During the day there are many activities which you can try. Dog sledding and snowmobiling are two of the most popular activities. There are other activities including snowshoe hiking, ice fishing, ice sculpting and kick-sledding. 8.What is the title of the short story? 9. Where is the setting? 10.Is this story entertaining? 11. Why did you think so? 12. Would you stay in this kind of hotel? 13. Why do you think the Ice Hotel is such a big tourist attraction? 14. What are the activities offered in this hotel? 15.

Example: When we were young we lived near a creek. One winter when I was about six and my brother was about three, we decided to sneak out of the house and go chop the ice. We put on our snowmobile suits, pulled on our boots and mittens and left through the back porch. We went down our neighbor's steps, found the biggest sticks we could, and began to whack away at the ice, oblivious to the rapidly flowing water. A. Descriptive     B. Narrative C. Persuasive D.

You sleep inside a warm The Ice Hotel in Sweden is made from thousands of tons of ice and snow. The hotel melts thermal sleeping bag on a special bed built from snow and ice. You will need to pack thermal Clothing and wear lots of warm layers. The temperature will be -5 degrees in your room. Between the bedding and layers of clothes, most guests do not feel any cold during the night. A staff member will wake you in the morning with a cup of hot juice. After warming up, you can go to the restaurant and enjoy a buffet breakfast. During the day there are many activities which you can try. Dog sledding and snowmobiling are two of the most popular activities. There are other activities including snowshoe hiking, ice fishing, ice sculpting and kick-sledding. True or False: 1. The Ice Hotel can be found in Sweden. 2. The hotel is made of wood. 3.The temperature outside is -5 degrees. 4. Dog sledding is a popular activity for guests. 5. The hotel has 100 rooms.

We put on our snowmobile suits, pulled on our boots and mittens and left through the back porch. We went down our neighbor's steps, found the biggest sticks we could, and began to whack away at the ice, oblivious to the rapidly flowing water. A. Descriptive     B. Narrative C. Persuasive D.
