                                            ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</a>

The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</a>

People from the provinces are then encouraged to visit those places and to live there eventually. a. Migration is a major problem in NCRb.

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            MAIN IDEA: High-school proms should be banned. A. Proms pressure students to spend a ridiculous amount of money on gowns, tuxes, flowers, and even limos or cars Prom preparations distract students for many weeks from the real business of school, which is education. In addition, the social pressure to get a date for the prom makes many people miserable. B. Proms usually feature a theme, and the room the prom is held in is decorated according to that theme. Often a photographer is hired to take pictures of the couples as they arrive. Some proms even have thrones set up for the prom king and queen. C. At most schools, proms are chaperoned by teachers and administrators. Of course, the students would prefer that no adults were in the room, especially adults who should stay in the classroom or office where they belong. What they don't realize is that the chaperones are often as ill at ease as the students they are watching 2 MAIN IDEA: Speaking before a group is a problem for many people. A. Many people will go to almost any length to avoid speaking to a group. If they are forced to do it, they can feel so anxious that they actually develop physical symptoms. If asked, people will often prefer that anything happen to them as an alterative to having to speak in public. B. Some people will pretend to be ill to avoid speaking publicly. Stage fright, stammering, and blushing are frequent reactions. When asked to rank their worst fears, people often list public speaking as even worse than death.​</a>

                                            Second Quarter Project Directions: Read the model argumentative essay, identify the parts by rewriting the important or the essential statements in the box. Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

                            5. ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</h2><br />

                            8.  Activity 1 Directions: Write YES on the space provided if the paragraphs are examples of an editorial introduction and NO if not. 1. The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</h2><br />

                            20. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow.

                            26. MAIN IDEA: High-school proms should be banned. A. Proms pressure students to spend a ridiculous amount of money on gowns, tuxes, flowers, and even limos or cars Prom preparations distract students for many weeks from the real business of school, which is education. In addition, the social pressure to get a date for the prom makes many people miserable. B. Proms usually feature a theme, and the room the prom is held in is decorated according to that theme. Often a photographer is hired to take pictures of the couples as they arrive. Some proms even have thrones set up for the prom king and queen. C. At most schools, proms are chaperoned by teachers and administrators. Of course, the students would prefer that no adults were in the room, especially adults who should stay in the classroom or office where they belong. What they don't realize is that the chaperones are often as ill at ease as the students they are watching 2 MAIN IDEA: Speaking before a group is a problem for many people. A. Many people will go to almost any length to avoid speaking to a group. If they are forced to do it, they can feel so anxious that they actually develop physical symptoms. If asked, people will often prefer that anything happen to them as an alterative to having to speak in public. B. Some people will pretend to be ill to avoid speaking publicly. Stage fright, stammering, and blushing are frequent reactions. When asked to rank their worst fears, people often list public speaking as even worse than death.​</h2><br />

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />
