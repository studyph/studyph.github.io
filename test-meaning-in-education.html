Then, identify which technicalterm used in research is being described in each sentence. Write your answer on theline.1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal ofSocial Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which arestudent-centered approach is recommended to modem pedagogy especially todaythat we used outcome-based education.2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing anadopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significantvalues of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</a>

Write your answer on theline.1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal ofSocial Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which arestudent-centered approach is recommended to modem pedagogy especially todaythat we used outcome-based education.2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing anadopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significantvalues of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</h2><br />

METHOD
Observe and identify the
problem
What is the topic or project that you
want to work on?
Gather data
Use available resources (library and
internet resources, consultation with
experts, interview with key informants) to learn as
much about the problem as possible.
Form a hypothesis
This is a sort of educated guess about what you
expect. It is a statement used to predict the
outcome of an experiment.
-
Test the hypothesis
Design and perform an experiment to test your
hypothesis. An experiment has an independent
and dependent variable.
Analyze data
Record observations and analyze the
meaning of the data. Often, you'll
prepare a table or graph of the data
Draw conclusion
Conclude whether to accept or reject
your hypothesis.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You have probably learned that the scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate. To answer those questions, scientists use data and evidence gathered from observations, experience, or experiments to answer their questions.But scientific inquiry rarely proceeds in the same sequence of steps outlined by the scientific method. For example, the order of the steps might change because more questions arise from the data that is collected. Still, to come to verifiable conclusions, logical, repeatable steps of the scientific method must be followed. This video of The Scientific Method Made Easy explains scientific method succinctly and well.</p><br />

In 2015, it was recorded that around 34% of the population in 2015were not married. A researcher surveyed a random sample of 500 couples. He found out that 18% ofthem were living together but unmarried. Test at 5% significance level if the current percentage ofunmarried couples is different from 34%.6. The average number of years to finish basic education is 14.

Test the hypothesis at 93%confidence interval that the average number of years to finish basic education is less than 14,7. A sample of 100 private school students were surveyed whether theyplanned to transfer to public school to the incoming school year.

                            30. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is a standardized test required to be admitted to many graduate schools in the United States. A high score in the GRE makes admission more likely. According to the Educational Testing Service, the mean score for takers of GRE who do not have training courses is 555 with a standard deviation of 139. Brain Philippines (BP) offers expensive GRE training courses, claiming their graduates score better than those who have not taken any training courses. To test the company's claim, a statistician randomly selected 40 graduates of BP and asked their GRE scores and the random sample of 40 graduates he obtains recorded a mean score of 560 in GRE. Test at 5% level of significance.
1. What is the appropriate Alternative hypothesis for this problem?
A. u = 555
B. u &lt; 555
C. u &gt; 555
D. u /= 555
2. What test statistic will be used for the test?
A one-tailed z-test
B. one-tailed t-test
C. two-tailed z-test
D two-tailed t test
3. What is the computed test statistic?
A. 0 2275
B. -0.2275
C. 2.9928
D. -2.9928
4. What is the critical value/s at 5% level of significance? (if two answers are
possible, ENTER BOTH LETTERS ONLY eg: XY, YZ, ZY, YX)
A 1.96
B 1.645
C. -1.96
D. -1 645
5. Based on the computation and decision rule, what is the best decision?
A. Accept Ho
B. Reject Ho
C. Fail to reject Ho
D. Fail to Reject Ha</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) D. u /= 555 </p><p></p>This means that the graduates who have taken the BP GRE training course have a different mean GRE score from those who have not taken any training courses.<p></p><p></p><p>2.) B. one-tailed t-test </p><p></p>Since the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, we use a t-test.<p></p><p>3.) 0.53 </p><p></p>To compute the t-test statistic, we use the formula t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n), where x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the hypothesized population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.<p></p>t = (560 - 555) / (139 / √40) = 0.53<p>None of the choices</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.) B. 1.645 </p><p></p>At 5% level of significance with a one-tailed test, the critical value for a t-test with 39 degrees of freedom is 1.645.<p></p><p></p><p>5.) C. Fail to reject Ho </p><p></p>Since the computed t-test statistic of 0.53 is less than the critical value of 1.645, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the mean GRE score of BP graduates who have taken the training course is different from the mean GRE score of those who have not taken any training courses at a 5% level of significance.<p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p></p><br />
