Television is one of the least powerful tools in communicating information, especially in news broadcasting.1. Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place to another.2. A multimedia application may require the use of speech, music and sound effects.3. Graphics do not make the multimedia application attractive.4. Video clips can be edited easily.5. In a television broadcast, the director should use a series of standards, calls and set procedures to direct the efforts ofthe video crew6. The digital video files can be stored like any other files in the computer and the quality of the video can still bemaintained.7. The video files can be transferred within a computer network it allows non-linear editing in any part of the video.8. A consistency of protocol does not allow the crew to anticipate their responsibilities by following standard operatingocedures with clearly defined and universally understood jargon[').9.

When the message is not clearly conveyed, the recipient may get the wrong information to share with others​</a>

Write your answer in the space provided. 1. According to the Transactional Model, people are both sender and receiver at the same time. 2. The best model to explain the complexities of face-to-face communication is the Interactive Model. 3. The content of the message is called the noise. 4. To convert a message into groups of words, symbols, gestures, or sounds that present ideas or concepts is called encoding, 5. Any communication that conveys a message consisting of words is called nonverbal communication. 6 Decoding is the process by which the receiver interprets the symbols used by the source of the message by converting them into concepts and ideas 7. Noise is the interference within the communication process. 8. Context is any medium within the communication process, 9. Shannon &amp; Weaver Model is an example of a Linear Communication Model. 10.

In a linear text, the reading path is non-sequential.3. In a nonlinear text, the reading path is sequential. 4. A reading path is the path or the way the readers take through a text.5. There are more than two reading paths.6. A linear text is a traditional text that needs to be read from beginning to the end. 7. Novels, poems, short stories, letters, educational texts are examples of nonlinear texts. 8. Linear text is the most common type of reading9. Nonlinear text has many reading paths since it is the reader who will decide when to start reading.10. Linear texts consist of visuals or graphs.11. Listening is a form of communication.12. Effective listening makes messages clear. 13. You can get the message of the speaker even if you are not paying attention.14.

It depends on the past and is concerned with the idea of time.According to the transactional communication model, communication is a result of our <strong>learning</strong>.According to Wilbur Schramm,<strong> man's range of experience</strong> has an impact on communication since the sender and receiver can communicate because they have shared experiences.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the Shannon-Weaver model here: https://brainly.ph/question/3737154#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

While some models go into greater detail to explain communication than others, even the most intricate model is unable to capture the essence of even the briefest communication contact. For communication students, models are still helpful because they help us define communication, apply communication principles, and see specific ideas and phases in the communication process.</p><p></p><p>Despite the differences between these communication methods, they have some characteristics. Participants, messages, encoding, decoding, and channels are all components of the <strong>transmission</strong> model and the <strong>interaction</strong> model, the first two models we'll talk about. In communication models, the senders and/or receivers of messages during a communication encounter are the participants. The verbal or nonverbal information being sent from the sender to the recipient is known as the message. For instance, when you say "Hello!" to a buddy, you are conveying a greeting that your friend will hear.</p><p></p>Linear communication model<p>The linear or transmission model of communication views communication as a <strong>one-way</strong>, linear process in which a sender consciously delivers a message to a recipient (Ellis &amp; McClintock, 1990). Within a communication interaction, this paradigm places special emphasis on the sender and message. Despite being a part of the model, the receiver is seen more as a goal or conclusion than as a continuing process.</p><p></p>Model of interactive communication<p>According to the interactive or interaction model of communication, communication is a process in which participants switch between the roles of sender and receiver to generate meaning by communicating and receiving feedback in a variety of social and physical contexts (Schramm, 1997). The interactive model includes feedback, which transforms communication into a more engaging, <strong>two-way</strong> process rather than depicting it as a linear, one-way process.</p>Communication through transactions<p>As communication research developed, models grew to incorporate more of the communication process. Many academics believe that communication encompasses more than just the act of having dialogues and expressing meaning. We don't send messages as computers do, and we don't smoothly switch between the sender and receiver positions as a conversation progresses. Because communication involves more than just sending and receiving signals, we are also unable to deliberately decide to cease communicating. The conceptualization of communication, the functions of sender and receiver, and the significance of context are only a few examples of how the transaction model differs significantly from the transmission and interaction models (Barnlund, 1970).</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about example situations of the Shannon weaver model Schramm model and transactional model​: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5069732#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            27. TRUE OR FALSE (PA HELP PLSSS)1. There is a difference between linear and nonlinear texts especially when it comes to reading path. 2. In a linear text, the reading path is non-sequential.3. In a nonlinear text, the reading path is sequential. 4. A reading path is the path or the way the readers take through a text.5. There are more than two reading paths.6. A linear text is a traditional text that needs to be read from beginning to the end. 7. Novels, poems, short stories, letters, educational texts are examples of nonlinear texts. 8. Linear text is the most common type of reading9. Nonlinear text has many reading paths since it is the reader who will decide when to start reading.10. Linear texts consist of visuals or graphs.11. Listening is a form of communication.12. Effective listening makes messages clear. 13. You can get the message of the speaker even if you are not paying attention.14. The purpose of the speaker is very important in order to understand what he is trying to say.15. There aredifferent purposes of listening 16. Getting information is quite easy even if you are not listening to the speaker. 17. Following is one of the most important purposes of listening,18.

Shannon-Weaver is the mother of all communication models 2. in linear model, there is greater chances of experiencing noise barriers. 3. The receiver and sender can play the same roles simultaneously in the interactive model of communication 4 The sender cannot be sure if the receiver got the message, unless the receiver gives feedback. 5. The feedback is present in the linear communication model. 5. Interactive Model of Communication is a two-way process. 7 Transaction Model has complicated communication process. Shannon-Weaver Model is an example of transaction model 9 Interactive Model includes the feedback as another element in the communication process 10 Berlo's S-M-C-R model is an example of interactive model 11 The process of interpreting the message is affected by noise alone 12. Feedback allows the sender to clearly evaluate the effectiveness of the message 13. Interactive Model is also known as Convergence Model. 14.
