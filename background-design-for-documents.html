VI. HYPHOTHESIS
VII. PHOTO DOCUMENTATION</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>I. Overview</p><p></p><p>Water filtration illustration, circa 500 BCE. In the 1700's the first water filters for domestic application were applied. These were made of wool, sponge and charcoal. In 1804 the first actual municipal water treatment plant designed by Robert Thom, was built in Scotland. Water filtering is a method used to filter out undesired chemical compounds, organic and inorganic materials, and biological contaminants from water. The purpose of water filtration is to provide clean drinking water.</p><p></p><p>II. Background Information</p><p></p><p>Water filtration is the process of removing or reducing the concentration of particulate matter, including suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi, as well as other undesirable chemical and biological contaminants from contaminated water to produce safe and clean water for a specific purpose, such as drinking, medical, and pharmaceutical applications.</p><p></p><p>IV. Procedure</p><p></p><p>During filtration, the clear water passes through filters that have different pore sizes and are made of different materials (such as sand, gravel, and charcoal). These filters remove dissolved particles and germs, such as dust, chemicals, parasites, bacteria, and viruses.</p><p></p><p>V. Guide Questions</p><p></p><p>Answers:</p><p></p><p>1. To filter the water to the cleanest standard and to provide clean drinking water.</p><p></p><p>2. We are limited in the number of materials we can use and when selecting materials, we must adhere to a strict budget.</p><p></p><p>3. Compare our filtered samples to standard water solutions. Solution A is the most pure. Calculate how much money we made from our filter design.</p><p></p><p>4. A sand and pebble filter removes most of the impurities remaining in water after coagulation and sedimentation have taken place. The charcoal helps remove toxins from the water without stripping the water of salts and important minerals. The cotton ball layer helps to keep the other layers of your filter from falling out into your water. </p><p></p><p>VI. Hypothesis</p><p></p><p>If water containing bacteria and dirt goes through the water filter then the water will be clearer after filtration.</p><br />
