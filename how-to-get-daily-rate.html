                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jasmine's overtime pay for 10 hours of work is 1.25 * 500 = 625 pesos. Her total pay for the day is 625 + 500 = 1125 pesos.</p><p></p><p>A. The size of each tablecloth is 1.25 meters x 1.25 meters = 1.5625 square meters.</p><p>B. The total size of all the tablecloths needed is 1.5625 square meters/table x 8 tables = 12.5 square meters.</p><p>C. The cost of all the tablecloths needed is 20 pesos/square meter x 12.5 square meters = 250 pesos.</p><p>D. The length of lace needed for each tablecloth is 1.25 meters + 1.25 meters + 0.1 meters + 0.1 meters = 2.7 meters.</p><p>E. The cost of lace for all the tablecloths is 2.7 meters/tablecloth x 8 tablecloths x 7 pesos/meter = 172 pesos.</p><p></p><p>A. The distance between the two convenience stores is 200 ⅝ km - 159 3/16 km = 41 5/8 km.</p><p>B. In 1 1/42 hours, truck A will travel 70 3/4 km/hour x 1 1/42 hours = 73 3/7 km. Truck B will travel 80 1/4 km/hour x 1 1/42 hours = 81 km. The distance between the two trucks will be 81 km - 73 3/7 km = 7 9/7 km.</p><p>C. Truck B needs to travel 200 ⅝ km - 159 3/16 km = 41 5/8 km more than truck A.</p><p>D. Truck A will reach the convenience store at 7:30 am + 159 3/16 km / 70 3/4 km/hour = 11:43 am. Truck B will reach the convenience store at 7:30 am + 200 ⅝ km / 80 1/4 km/hour = 11:51 am.</p><p>E. Truck A will consume 5L of gasoline for every 20 km x 159 3/16 km = 31.8125L of gasoline for the round trip. Truck B will consume 5L of gasoline for every 20 km x 200 ⅝ km = 40.125L of gasoline for the round trip.</p><p>F. The total cost of gasoline consumed by the two trucks is 31.8125L x 48 pesos/L + 40.125L x 48 pesos/L = 1521.5 pesos + 1932 pesos = 3453.5 pesos.</p><p></p><p>The total cost of tickets for the adults is 500 pesos/ticket x 6 tickets = 3000 pesos. The total cost of tickets for the children is 500 pesos/2 x 19 tickets = 4750 pesos. The total cost of all the tickets is 3000 pesos + 4750 pesos = 7750 pesos. The change from 5,000 pesos is 5000 pesos - 7750 pesos = -2750 pesos, so more money is needed to pay for the tickets. An additional 2750 pesos is needed.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine's overtime pay for 8.75 hours of work is 0.25 * 56.25 pesos/hour x 8.75 hours = 14.0625 pesos/day. Her total daily earnings are 56.25 pesos/hour x 8.75 hours + 14.0625 pesos = 626.5625 pesos. Her total weekly earnings are 626.5625 pesos/day x 3 days = 1879.6875 pesos. Her average daily earnings are 1879.6875 pesos/3 days = 626</p><p></p><p></p><p>THANKS</p><p></p><br />
