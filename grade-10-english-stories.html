People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2.

1. With all confidence, Aja Gray delivered Martin Luther’s “I Have A Dream,” one of
the most popular declamation pieces before a large crowd during their English
Fest.
2. Mr. Insong was scheduled for a teaching demonstration. He chose the topic he
was most comfortable with and rehearsed his demonstration. Because he didn’t

an index card to remind him of the flow of the topics or ideas.
3. Father Delos Santos reads every single word from the Holy Scripture to the mass
goers.
4. Mommy Rose reads the story of “Pedro Pinduko” to baby Ralph.
5. Karen Davila reported the news written on a teleprompter.

where she could find the nearest Palawan Pera Express Padala Center in the
area.
8. Vincent rehearsed his valedictory address weeks before the graduation. On the
day of the graduation, he delivered it without bringing any notes.
9. Mr. San Juan delivered an inspirational talk. In the beginning of his talk, he
appeared very certain and inspiring but seemed to lose connection with the
audience at the middle of his speech and started groping for words to say next.
10.Mr. Lloyd, being the master of ceremonies, reads the educational achievements
of Dr. Eugene, being the guest of honor in their graduation rites.
11.Mr. Alvarico showed his Grade 12-Phosphenes students a picture. He gave them
a minute to look at it, then asked Andy to share to the class what she thought
about the picture.
12.Jonathan slowly came inside the room hoping he would not be noticed by Mr.
Jeremias. Just as he was about to sit on his chair, his teacher asked him for his
reason for coming to class late.
13.Jenelyn, being the class president, read aloud to the class the announcement
and the dictated exam that Mrs. Lourdes, the TLE teacher, asked her to read
during their time, since she was still in a meeting with the principal.
14.Reynaldo, the reception host, called Julian, who never had any part or role in the
entourage, to go on stage and share to the group his fun memories with Denver,
the groom.
15.Mr. Jacaba was invited to talk about his struggles in life and how he managed to
overcome them. He was very certain what points he would include in his talk and
in which order. To guide him through the speech, he brought with him a notecard
containing the outline of the points he wanted to discuss.</h2><br />

READING COMPREHENSION TEST (10 items) GRADE 9 - ENGLISH Direction: Read each selection carefully then road and answer tho questions that follow Writo the latter of your answer in your answer shoot DO NOT write anything on the questionnaire The Scientific Method ancient times saw that the sun came up from one side of the earth, moved across the sky, and went down on In ancient times people tried to explain the world around them based on what they saw. People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. People in ancient times believed that the sun travels around the earth. B. People in ancient times knew that the earth was round. C. People in ancient times didn't try to explain the world around them. 3. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, observation proved that eating a candy bar made a sick stomach feel better. B. In the example, there could be several reasons your sick stomach felt better after you ate a candy. C. In the example, there is only one explanation for why a sick stomach would feel better after you ate a candy bar. 4. Which of these is a small piece of information from the story that makes the story more interesting? A. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by not eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. B. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a different kind of candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach. C. In the example, you could test your hypothesis by eating a candy bar the next time you have a sick stomach 5. What does non-scientific thinking means? A.
