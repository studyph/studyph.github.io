It has already caused global temperatures to rise, leading to extreme weather conditions like floods, heatwaves, and droughts. The impacts of climate change are far reaching and affect all aspects of life — from the air we breathe and water we drink, to the food we eat and the jobs we have.</p><p></p><p>It’s clear that something drastic needs to be done to combat this crisis. Governments, corporations, and individuals must take action to reduce their carbon footprint and switch to more sustainable sources of energy. To make this happen, we need to create a new mindset that puts sustainability and climate protection first, while still allowing us to enjoy the comforts of modern life.</p><p></p><p>By making lifestyle changes such as driving hybrid vehicles, using renewable energy like solar panels, or reducing our consumption of goods, we can all make a difference. Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels is the key to minimizing the rate of climate change and its devastating effects. </p><p></p><p>In addition, governments must make it easier for renewable energy to be adopted by implementing incentives and regulations. This could include providing financial assistance to homeowners who switch to renewable energy sources, or providing tax relief for businesses that invest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO), working in partnership with both public and private sectors, has a proud history of vaccinology.  </p><p></p><p>By assessing vaccines for global supply, WHO’s groundbreaking Prequalification programme has made possible the deployment of quality-assured, safe and effective vaccines to dozens of countries across the world. This programme gives countries the security and confidence to know that vaccines being purchased meet WHO standards for safety, effectiveness and quality.</p><p></p><p>The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), created by WHO in the 1970s, has, with the help of UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and others, brought lifesaving vaccines to hundreds of millions of children around the world. The immunisation programme is found in every country on the globe.  It has the farthest reach and deepest impact of any public health programme. WHO staff have supported governments and health professionals to deliver vaccines where they are needed on the ground. Its success is measured in millions of lives saved each year.  Through vaccination, smallpox has been eradicated and polio is on the verge of being defeated</p><p></p><p>On constant alert, every year, WHO studies influenza trends, to work out which strains are emerging and should be included in the next season’s flu vaccine. And it continually monitors potential signals of pandemic threat.</p><p></p><p>WHO estimates that in 2018 (the latest year for which estimates are available), 25,000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, an 88% reduction the figure of 200,000 in 2000. </p><p></p><p>Global HPV vaccine coverage is increasing. HPV vaccines had been introduced in 106 countries by the end of 2019, representing a third of the global population of girls.</p><p></p><p>Today, 86% of the world’s children receive essential, lifesaving vaccines, increasing from around 20% back in 1980. This protects them and their communities against a range of infectious diseases, including measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and polio. The number of children paralysed by polio has been reduced by 99.9 percent worldwide over the last three decades. </p><p></p><p>This level of protection comes through a strong global effort to increase vaccine access and affordability, with support in recent decades from new partnerships like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance - focussing on expanding vaccine availability in the poorest countries - and the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The vaccines success story gives us hope for the future</p><p>As the world waits for a vaccine to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we look back to all that vaccines have achieved for humanity.Vaccines save millions of lives each year. The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a huge step forward in our global effort to end the pandemic and to get back to doing more of the things we enjoy with the people we love.</p><p></p><p>Sana po makatulong</p><p>at pa brainliest po kase 3 nalang brainliest ko:(</p><br />

The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. This warming effect has a wide range of consequences, from melting ice caps to more frequent and severe weather events. To combat climate change, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transition to clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.</p><p></p><p>Another crucial aspect of environmental conservation is protecting biodiversity. Every species has a role to play in the ecosystem, and the loss of one species can have far-reaching consequences. We need to protect habitats and prevent the extinction of endangered species to ensure the health and stability of the natural world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we need to address pollution. From air pollution to plastic waste in the oceans, pollution has a devastating impact on the environment and human health. We need to reduce our use of single-use plastics, adopt more sustainable transportation options, and promote clean energy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, environmental conservation is essential for the health and well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. By taking action to reduce our impact on the environment, we can ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

                        <p> While the rapid development of vaccines against COVID‑19 is an extraordinary achievement, successfully vaccinating the global population presents many challenges, from production to distribution, deployment, and importantly, acceptance. Trust in the vaccines is vital, and is critically dependant on the ability of governments to communicate the benefits of vaccination, and to deliver the vaccines safely and effectively. This brief addresses the role of governments in promoting confidence in the effectiveness and safety through effective communication, as well as trust in their ability to procure and distribute them efficiently and equitably. While only a small minority of the population holds strong anti-vaccination views, hesitancy about COVID‑19 vaccination is evident in many countries. Recognising that vaccination campaigns of the magnitude needed are unprecedented, government actions to garner trust will be essential to their success, and to the emergence of more resilient societies after the crisis.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\Large\blue {\overline { \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: }}[/tex]</p><p>Brainliest please ❤️</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Abortion: Why it should be legal  </strong></p><p>Under the article 258 of the RPC (Revised Penal Code), abortion practiced by the woman herself or by her parents. - The penalty of prison (correctional) mayor in the medium and maximum periods shall be imposed upon a woman who shall practice an abortion upon herself or shall consent that any other person should do so. This is one of the many laws that makes me question the credibility of our legislators in terms of implementing laws. Why would they pass such laws if it won’t benefit anyone, correct? And don’t get me wrong. I am just simply trying to prove that enforcing the said law is useless and disadvantageous.
</p><p>In the year 2000, statistics have shown that for every 1 000 pregnant women, 27 undergoes abortion. An unsafe one at that. In fact, 1 000 Filipino women dies each year from complications due to unsafe abortions. Following unsafe abortion might lead to complications such as: hemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation, incomplete abortion (failure to remove all of the pregnancy tissues from the uterus), and damage to the genital tract and internal organs. By legalizing and removing the stigma that surrounds abortion, women won’t have to risk their health and life by undergoing the said procedure in a safe manner.
</p><p>Now, you might come up with the most renowned argument contradicting the legalization of abortion. Humans, by the means of genetic sense, are the members of the biological species homo sapiens. Fetuses are humans. Killing humans is unethical. Therefore, killing fetuses is bad. Actually, generally speaking, killing is bad but we still do it to animals because we need their products in order to sustain life, right? Because: 1. Meat contains a great amount of protein, and 2. It controls the population in order for the ecosystem to remain balanced. But why shouldn’t we consume plants instead of killing animals? We actually can replace the meat in our diet with plant products, however, there are nutrients that are only present in animal meat that couldn’t be produced by plants. Every side has its own downsides; however, ones’ decision is not ours to make, correct? Same goes with abortion. Women undergo abortion because: 1. They do not have the capacity to sustain a child's life, and 2. They can’t afford the burden of guilt of abandoning a child. By consuming animals, our needs are met, and the ecosystem becomes balanced, but so does aborting babies.  </p><p>By aborting, the child won’t have to suffer from the consequences of being born without any parental figures and the supposed parents won’t have to suffer from the burden of bearing a child without proper preparation. Abortion also might actually help solve the long-running issue in our country which is overpopulation. Yes, we are talking about humans and not animals but what’s the difference anyways? Both possesses life and can feel pain. The only difference is that humans can talk and can freely express what they feel whereas animals can’t.
</p><p>Another argument you might probably think of while reading this paper is that since I’ve said before that fetuses are humans, and abortion includes the removal of a fetus which kills it, then abortion is basically killing and killing is considered as a mortal sin in the bible. Out of all the counterarguments about the validation of abortion, this is the only one with the weakest, grounds because you are basically basing your argument on religion which is wrong because the church cannot intervene with state affairs and vice versa. And also, not everyone in the Philippines follows the same beliefs as you do. In fact, some of them don’t believe in any form of higher power at all. A Catholic or Christian saying “You cannot do abortion. It is against the bible” is the same as a Muslim saying “You cannot eat pork. It is against the Qur’an”. You just can’t simply tell anyone not to do something because it is against YOUR religion.  </p><p>Another reason why I am against the illegalization of abortion is that they do not allow it under any circumstance. Whether the woman is a victim of rape or incest or a threat to the fetus' or woman's health, no one is permitted to abort which is wrong. Because of this, many victims had to carry the responsibility of raising an unwanted child or worse, a child born of non-consensual sex.  </p><p>The point of legalizing abortion is to provide safe, medical procedures for those who wishes to abort and not to encourage it. If it ever becomes legal here in our country, this is just a reminder that just because you can doesn’t mean you would. Legalizing abortion isn’t for you but for the others and if ever they make a choice to abort the child they are bearing, know that it is none of your business. You are not in place to judge someone’s actions.<strong>
