There are billions ofnerve cells in the brain. It receives information from all parts of the body. Signalsfrom the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travelalong nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions likecontraction of the cardiac muscles, respiration, digestion and circulation and allbody's voluntary muscles. The three [3] main parts of the Brain are theCerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem (medulla oblongata, pons]. Each parthas particular functions.The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four 41section or lobes. Areas for specific sensory, motor and mental activities aredistributed within the lobesLOBES1. Frontal2.

Axon - it transmits the message away from the cell body to the next one . WAYS ON HOW TO KEEP YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HEALTHY1. Eat healthy foods that are rich in calcium , potassium and fats such as fruits , vegetables , fish and nuts .2. Have enough sleep or rest .3.

Cell Body - the central part and contains the nucleus.2. Dendrites - it receives the message and carry them to the cell body .3. Axon - it transmits the message away from the cell body to the next one . WAYS ON HOW TO KEEP YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HEALTHY1. Eat healthy foods that are rich in calcium , potassium and fats such as fruits , vegetables , fish and nuts .2. Have enough sleep or rest .3. Exercise regularly .COMMON DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM1. Polio or Poliomyelitis - a virus that can affect the nervous system and can cause paralysis .2. Parkinson's Disease - it happens when the neuron pathways in the brain are destroyed. it can cause trembling of hands , arms , legs and face .3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Every single person has a skeleton made up of many bones. These bones give your body structure, let you move in many ways, protect your internal organs, and more. It's time to look at all your bones — the adult human body has 206 of them!</p><p>2.Junk food is unhealthy food that is high in calories from sugar or fat, with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value</p><p>3.someone want some expensive phone it's either wise/useful but some phone with a little expensive can use you can save a little money</p><p>4.To find out what water is made of, it helps to look at its chemical formula, which is H2O. This basically tells us that the water molecule is composed of two elements: hydrogen and oxygen or, more precisely, two hydrogen atoms (H2) and one oxygen atom (O). Hydrogen and oxygen are gases at room temperature.</p><p>5.Zumba targets lots of different muscle groups at once for total body toning. Boosts your heart health.
