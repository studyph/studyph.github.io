                                            pahelp namn Po pagawan Ng plotA bright red explosion sends a big impact and damages in the surface towards the city of Mystique. The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</a>

After walking for three hours, Pedro said, “I am so tired 1.) _____ we sit for a few minutes? My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset. I have heard that there are strange creatures coming out at night in this forest.” “Really?” Answered Pedro. “If that is the case, we 6.)_____ go back before four o’clock. By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</a>

                                            Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).

The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</h2><br />

My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset.

By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men.

                            4. Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).
