                        Project BOCA: Community-Based Action Towards Climate Change<p></p>● Subjects/program<p>We first became aware of the climatic change and its impact on human life over the previous century. When we first started looking into climate change, we discovered that the greenhouse effect is what is causing the earth's temperature to rise.</p><p></p><p>The ozone layer is being destroyed by the warming of the earth's surface, which also affects our water supply, agriculture, and transportation systems, among other things. Thus, both natural and human factors contribute to climate change. These include solar radiation, tectonic plate movement, volcanic eruption, and orbital variations, to start.</p><p></p><p>These <strong>activities </strong>have a negative impact on an area's geography, making it difficult for life to survive. Additionally, these activities significantly increase the earth's temperature, which upsets the natural order. Next, there are human factors. Man has engaged in numerous actions that injure both himself and the environment as a result of his need and greed. Due to human activity, numerous plant and animal species become extinct.</p><p></p><p>Deforestation, the use of fossil fuels, industrial waste, various forms of pollution, and many other human activities are among those that have a negative impact on the climate. All of these have a severe negative impact on the ecology and climate. And because of hunting, numerous species of animals and birds have either become extinct or are in danger of doing so.</p><p></p>● Main Ideas<p>It is said that since climate change begins with every one of us, we can all stop it as long as we take action.</p><p></p><p>It seems that most people don't care about maintaining the environment, which has serious consequences like climate change. Project Boca is an initiative to encourage individuals, particularly students and young people, to preserve the environment and decrease climate change's consequences on future generations.</p><p></p><p>After all, the impacts of climate change on a variety of social, cultural, and natural resources could have an impact on our society. We think that every person's activities count. Our activities can have a domino effect that encourages and motivates group efforts, leading us to the systemic change required to address a problem like a climate change.</p><p></p><p>The essential idea is that since many millennials don't care about the environment and we live in an age where gadgets and technology are at their highest point, our goal is to leverage technology or emerging trends to combat climate change. Since we are all responsible for causing climate change, we must provide a positive example for others. Starting in a tiny community like a barangay can spread to the entire nation or even the entire planet.</p><p></p>● Your Audience/participants<p>"<strong>Everyone </strong>has a role in the fight against climate change"</p><p></p>● Your primary role<p>Communities fight climate change and develop resilience to its effects by thinking and acting locally.</p><strong>establishing program strategies </strong>that will allow communities to participate in climate change mitigation efforts in a manner that supports their own social and economic development, and<strong>working with communities</strong> to develop adaptation plans that will increase their adaptability and capacity to deal with some of the anticipated changes caused by the climate.<p></p>● Your presentation/strategies<p>The following Project Boca goals are examples that anyone can complete:</p>Hobbies<p>Using pastimes like singing, dancing, and sketching to raise awareness of climate change</p><p></p>Programs<p>Implementing various government and non-government climate change programs</p><p></p>Social Media<p>Encourage individuals on social media to take action against climate change since change starts with oneself.</p><p></p>Transportation<p>Purchase carbon offsets for long automobile or aircraft rides, cycle to work a particular number of days each week, or take public transportation; purchase a hybrid or electric car.</p><p></p>Home energy<p>Reduce your usage of energy at home by doing an energy audit, purchasing energy-efficient equipment, and enrolling in your utility's WindSource or renewable energy programs (if applicable)</p><p></p>Waste<p>Reduce your consumption first and foremost, recycle and compost whenever you can ask your apartment complex, workplace, church, etc. to implement recycling and/or composting, and if composting is not an option where you live, speak with your local representatives about creating a composting program.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about recycling here: https://brainly.ph/question/332940</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We must work together to combat climate change. We each work and live in different parts of the country, and we can work together to combat climate change with our friends, families, and coworkers. Your effect doubles as you include more people in climate solutions. There are numerous ways for you to participate with your community for climate solutions, whether it's creating a green club at your church or school, working for a local NGO, arranging a community event, or joining a local chapter of the Transition Towns movement.
