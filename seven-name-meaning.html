The Cordillera Experience An excerpt The Cordillera Region is the ancestral homeland of the Cordillera indigenous peoples, collectively referred to as the "Igorots", meaning "people of the mountain”. There are seven (7) major ethnolinguistic groups or peoples, namely the Kankanaeys, the Bontocs, the Kalingas, the Ifugaos, the Tingguians, the Apayao or Isneg and Ibaloy. However, these are the popular reference to indigenous groups, but there are more "peoples" as distinct as "ili". "Ili" is a self-identifying group of indigenous people, with their own defined territory as their ancestral land, and their own indigenous socio-cultural systems. The culture and ways of life of the Cordillera indigenous peoples have common and diverse characteristics. The common features are found in their concept of ancestral land ownership and collective management of the land. The symbiotic relationship between the people and the land and environment is highly developed in the region, such that land is equated with life itself. anibeab ori: 9am of 20 Barsgeld or painel to sausood Source: https://asiasociety.org/cordillera-experience MysaysapeMar​</a>

The Cordillera Experience An excerpt The Cordillera Region is the ancestral homeland of the Cordillera indigenous peoples, collectively referred to as the "Igorots", meaning "people of the mountain”. There are seven (7) major ethnolinguistic groups or peoples, namely the Kankanaeys, the Bontocs, the Kalingas, the Ifugaos, the Tingguians, the Apayao or Isneg and Ibaloy. However, these are the popular reference to indigenous groups, but there are more "peoples" as distinct as "ili". "Ili" is a self-identifying group of indigenous people, with their own defined territory as their ancestral land, and their own indigenous socio-cultural systems. The culture and ways of life of the Cordillera indigenous peoples have common and diverse characteristics. The common features are found in their concept of ancestral land ownership and collective management of the land. The symbiotic relationship between the people and the land and environment is highly developed in the region, such that land is equated with life itself. anibeab ori: 9am of 20 Barsgeld or painel to sausood Source: https://asiasociety.org/cordillera-experience MysaysapeMar​</h2><br />
