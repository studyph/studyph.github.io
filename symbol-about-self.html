The body is not an object to be studied in relation to culture, but is to beconsidered as the subject of culture, or in other words as the existential ground ofculture. On the other hand, Geertz (1973) described culture as "a system of inheritedconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate,perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life".The interpretation of the symbols in each culture is essential which gives meaning toone's action. Each culture has its own symbols and has its own meaning; one mustneed to comprehend those meanings keeping in mind the end goal to understand theculture. One must disconnect the components of culture, discover the relationshipamong those components, and portray theentire framework in some broad way.​can you explain it for me pls?? need ko lang po</a>

Central to Leninism is the idea of historical materialism.____________ 2. Through the lens of symbolic interactionism, society is examined by concentrating on the subjective meanings that people impose on things, incidents, and actions.____________ 3. Structural-functionalism is a dominant approach in the social sciences that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability.____________ 4. As a natural science approach, Marxism advocated for a classless society where all people are equal in resource distribution, rights, and privileges.____________ 5. Herbert Blumer believed that the self is a social entity and that it requires that individual selves are the products of social interaction, not the rational or natural prerequisites of that interaction.____________ 6. Friedrich Engels, a close companion to Karl Marx, was one of those who organized the ideas of Marxism after Marx died.____________ 7. Emile Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology and became France’s first sociology professor in 1895.____________ 8. Karl Marx focused on a critique of capitalism, on how it should be transformed so that social inequalities will be abolished.____________ 9. Symbols are the means by which people associate meanings that are created and maintained in social interaction.____________ 10. Self is the being or nature of a person one imagines when he or she thinks about who he or she is.​</a>

                            10. 1023Adaptive andMaladaptiveEncompassingSharedding/s:CultureIntegratedSymbolicLeamedNaturalCulture defined: Culture is shared, symbolic, natural, learned, integrated, encompassingand maladaptive and adaptive.FOLCsordas (1999) elaborated that the human body is not essential for anthropologicalstudy but the paradigm of embodiment can be explored in the understanding cultureand the self. The body is not an object to be studied in relation to culture, but is to beconsidered as the subject of culture, or in other words as the existential ground ofculture. On the other hand, Geertz (1973) described culture as "a system of inheritedconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate,perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life".The interpretation of the symbols in each culture is essential which gives meaning toone's action. Each culture has its own symbols and has its own meaning; one mustneed to comprehend those meanings keeping in mind the end goal to understand theculture. One must disconnect the components of culture, discover the relationshipamong those components, and portray theentire framework in some broad way.​can you explain it for me pls?? need ko lang po</h2><br />
                        <p>Culture is a complex concept that encompasses many different aspects of human experience. It is shared among members of a particular group or society, and is expressed through various symbolic forms such as language, art, and rituals. Culture is also learned through socialization and is passed down from one generation to the next.</p><p></p><p>The concept of embodiment is also important in understanding culture. This refers to the idea that the human body is not simply an object to be studied, but is the subject of culture and the existential ground of culture. In other words, the body is not just a vessel for culture, but is an active participant in the cultural process.</p><p></p><p>As with any complex concept, there are different ways to approach the study of culture. For example, some anthropologists, like Clifford Geertz, focus on the symbolic forms of culture and the ways in which these symbols give meaning to our actions.

                        <p>Traditional refers to beliefs, practices, and customs that have been passed down from previous generations and are still prevalent in a particular society. This can include cultural norms, values, and traditions.</p><p></p><p>Transitional refers to a period of change in which a society is moving from one set of beliefs, values, or practices to another. This can be seen in the shift from traditional to modern ways of thinking and acting.</p><p></p><p>Indigenization refers to the process of adapting or making something native or indigenous to a particular place or culture. This can involve the incorporation of local customs, beliefs, and traditions into a foreign concept or practice.</p><p></p><p>The basic principles of symbolic interactionism posit that human behavior is shaped by symbols and the meanings that individuals attach to those symbols. This perspective emphasizes the role of interpretation and subjective meanings in shaping social reality.</p><p></p><p>"Mind, Self, and Society" is a seminal book written by George Herbert Mead that outlines his theory of symbolic interactionism. In this book, Mead argues that the self is developed through social interaction, and that individuals come to understand their own thoughts and behaviors through the way that they are perceived by others.</p><p></p><p>The 3 stages of development of self are the preparatory stage, play stage, and game stage. These stages, as described by George Herbert Mead, describe how the self is developed through social interaction and communication.</p><p></p><p>Social science is a field of study concerned with the scientific investigation of human social behavior and its causes and consequences. Examples of social sciences include sociology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p><p></p><p>Natural science is a branch of science that deals with the study of the physical and natural world through observation and experimentation. Examples of natural sciences include physics, chemistry, biology, and geology.</p><p></p><p>Humanities are a branch of academic study concerned with human culture, society, and behavior. Examples of humanities include history, literature, philosophy, and the arts.</p><p></p><p>Social function refers to the role or purpose that a particular social phenomenon, institution, or behavior serves in maintaining and supporting a society.</p><p></p><p>Social equilibrium refers to a state of balance or stability in a social system, where social forces and structures are in alignment and there is a sense of stability and order.</p><p></p><p>Karl Marx's theory, also known as Marxist theory, posits that society is divided into two classes: the bourgeoisie (the owners of the means of production) and the proletariat (the workers). Marx argues that this division of labor leads to conflict and that eventually the proletariat will overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a classless society.</p><p></p><p>Rational choice theory, also known as neoclassical economics, posits that individuals make decisions based on their rational self-interest. This theory is used to explain a wide range of social and economic phenomena, including consumer behavior, voting behavior, and market behavior.</p><p></p><p>Pantayong Pananaw is a Filipino term that refers to a world view or perspective. It is often used in the context of Philippine studies to describe the cultural and historical perspective of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Pilipinolohiya is a term used in the Philippines to describe the study of Philippine culture, history, and society.</p><p></p><p>Sikolohiya is the Philippine term for psychology, the scientific study of human behavior, thought, and experience.</p><p></p><p>Manifest function refers to the intended and obvious consequences of a social phenomenon, institution, or behavior. Latent function refers to the unintended and hidden consequences of a social phenomenon, institution, or behavior.</p><p></p><p>Dysfunctions are negative consequences or outcomes of a social phenomenon, institution, or behavior that do not serve the interests or goals of a society. Social dysfunctions refer to negative consequences that affect the social system as a whole, while manifest and latent dysfunctions refer to negative consequences that are either openly visible or hidden and unintended, respectively.</p><p></p><p>For example, a manifest dysfunction of a particular law or policy might be that it leads to increased poverty and inequality, while a latent dysfunction might be that it undermines social trust and cooperation among citizens. Understanding the manifest and latent dysfunctions of social phenomena is important in order to identify areas for improvement and make changes that can improve the functioning of a society.</p><br />
