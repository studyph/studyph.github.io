                                            PA HELP POActivity 3. Empower yourself (Reading activity) The Greeks formulated the word politics during the 4th and 5th century. Politics was inseparable in the life in the polis or a place of state shared by a certain group of people. This concept of politics is as old as the first organization created by man. According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</a>

                            10. PA HELP POActivity 3. Empower yourself (Reading activity) The Greeks formulated the word politics during the 4th and 5th century. Politics was inseparable in the life in the polis or a place of state shared by a certain group of people. This concept of politics is as old as the first organization created by man. According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</h2><br />
