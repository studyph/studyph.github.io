                        <p>1. A trembling or shaking of the earth that is volcanic or tectonic (seismic) in origin, often resulting in severe damage. Coverage for property damage caused by the perils of earthquake or volcanic eruption.</p><p>2. Faults are cracks in the earth's crust along which there is movement. These can be massive (the boundaries between the tectonic plates themselves) or very small. If tension builds up along a fault and then is suddenly released, the result is an earthquake.</p><p>3. The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks.</p><p>4. Seismic waves fall into two general categories: body waves (P-waves and S-waves), which travel through the interior of the earth, and surface waves, which travel only at the earth's surface.</p><p>5. Body waves travel through the body of a planet. Surface waves travel along the surface. There are two types of body waves: P-waves travel fastest and through solids, liquids, and gases; S-waves only travel through solids.</p><p>6. The two main types of waves are body waves and surface waves. Body waves can travel through the earth's inner layers, but surface waves can only move along the surface of the planet like ripples on water. Earthquakes radiate seismic energy as both body and surface waves.</p><p>7. Seismic waves are usually generated by movements of the Earth's tectonic plates but may also be caused by explosions, volcanoes and landslides. When an earthquake occurs shockwaves of energy, called seismic waves, are released from the earthquake focus.</p><p>8. As you go deeper in depth, pressure increases. Density = mass/volume. The layers beneath us due to pressure get packed to the point of being very dense.</p><p>9. P- and S-waves motion. Because liquids have no resistance to shear and cannot sustain a shear wave, S-waves cannot travel through liquid material. The Earth's outer core is believed to be liquid because S-waves disappear at the mantle–core boundary, while P-waves do not.</p><p>10. A seismic wave is an elastic wave generated by an impulse such as an earthquake or an explosion. Seismic waves may travel either along or near the earth's surface (Rayleigh and Love waves) or through the earth's interior (P and S waves).</p><p></p>ANSWERED BY:ʕ´RXVENIE`ʔ<p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><p></p><br />
