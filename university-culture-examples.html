Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras- Outstanding Universal Value The Rice Terraces of the Philippines Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far back as two millennia ago in the precolonici Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modemization. Built on steeper lopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugco Rice Terrace have complex imigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops. The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one.

addressing social problems.
2. The use of the different approaches in the social sciences is not
important to understand the social problems because our current social
problems are not connected with the other problems.
3. Social problems are defined by history, cultural values, cultural
universals and awareness.
4. Problems that deal with social and economic development require an
interdisciplinary approach.
5. Poverty is an example of social problem in the Philippines. A person or
a community is considered in a state of poverty if they do not have
financial resources and essentials to satisfy their minimum standard of
living.</a>

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras- Outstanding Universal Value The Rice Terraces of the Philippines Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far back as two millennia ago in the precolonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare. The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization. Built on steeper lopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terrace have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops. The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao Agri-ecosystem. Questions: 1. What makes the Rice Terraces extraordinary? 2.
