                                            make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

Answer the following questions in every situation. (60 points all) 1. Margie, the mother of Eloy, is known to be a church servant in their Local Church. One night while she was preparing for diner, suddenly, her son came rushing to her. This son of hers confessed that her girlfriend Ali was found pregnant. Her girlfriend, being a minor, told her parents that she was just simply seduced by her boyfriend that is why they ended up with a child in her womb. Hugo, the father of Ali and a military sergeant, becomes furious and hunts the lover of his daughter to harm the latter. Afraid of the father of Ai, Aling Margie brought his son to Pastor Fred, the eldest brother of Margie, to seek refuge for his son.

How will you classify your choice? Is it practical or intellectual? c. What will be the cost of your decision? 2. During a buy-bust operation conducted by the PNP San Gabriel City, the daughter of the incumbent city mayor, Helena, was accosted by the policemen in pot – session. There is a strong public belief that Helena is behind the rampant drug activities in his town. During the preliminary investigation, Dr. Heart, the resident criminal laboratory doctor is given 15 the task of conducting a drug test to the accosted daughter of the city mayor. Dr. Heart is known for her credibility for her profession and is even recognized by the United Nations as one of the excellent practitioners in her field. In the afternoon before she would conduct the drug test for the accused, she received a call from her mother, who was a victim of a drug related crime, saying that she must perform the drug test well. After a few minutes, the city mayor himself shows up and offers 1.5 million pesos surety just to falsify her soon to be findings. The mayor indirectly conveyed that if she does anything against his will, evil may befall on Dr. Heart’s family. Outside the Crime Laboratory is a group of anti-drugs citizens shouting for justice and conviction against the accused daughter of the city mayor. If you are Dr. Heart, what will you do? a. What will you do? b. How will you classify your choice? Is it practical or intellectual? c. What will be the cost of your decision?​</h2><br />
                        SITUATION AND EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS1. MARGIE'S DILEMMA<p>a.<strong> Priests or spiritual leaders are mediators.</strong> So, as a pastor, I should invite all parties involved to put up a discussion inside the parish church. In this way, violence can be avoided. Or if emotional distress rush up, Pastor Fred can deescalate the situation.</p><p></p><p>b. My choice would be classified as<strong> intellectual </strong>because the situation is highly-charged emotionally. So, there must be a compass of logic to it before they do something they regret. </p><p></p><p>c. The cost of my decision my cause some people to resent me because it's a family matter. Most family matters must be handled by their own and outsiders are often unwelcome. I might be <strong>subjected to insults</strong> or verbal abuses. </p><p></p>2. DR. HEART-- INTEGRITY OR FEAR?<p>a. There is certainly fear with this and with that she is going against a powerful person. Dr. Heart should accept the offer and falsify the drug test. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, she should keep the original results and keep a record of the threats and bribing directly from anyone connected to the mayor. If the mayor himself showed up, she should record the conversation and transaction privately. She can keep the money but she has to wait and secure her family before revealing the truth. </p><p></p><p>b.<strong> Practical.</strong> Being heroic and having integrity is good but it will murder you or anyone you are close with. To guard your safety and other's safety, good morals should be delayed first. </p><p></p><p><strong>c. The cost of my decision will be my career.</strong> As a health practitioner, accepting bribes and falsification of data are frowned upon. There might be trust issues about my actions but there are no choices. </p><p></p><p><strong>DILEMMA</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10489620</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            16. make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.
