Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. They provide us with a sense of connection, purpose, support and, ultimately, overall better health and longevity. Dozens of studies have shown that people who have fulfilling relationships with family, friends and community members are happier, have fewer health problems, and live longer.</p><p></p><p>2.Social relationships are also important factors in regards to the general health of adolescents. Poor social relationships can affect their physical health, habits7 and adolescent development, and increase alcohol consumption,</p><p></p><p>3.For example, a student may alter his or her behavior to match that of other students in a class. The majority-held opinions of a group of friends are likely to inform the views of new members to that social group. </p><p></p><p>4. People will be more open to things that they see others doing. For example, seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well. </p><p></p><p>Think of the five closest friends you have in your life and do the following:</p><p></p><p>1. Each of them helps me with my everyday problems, they encourage and makes sure I won't be sad.</p><p></p><p>2.each of them have their own kind of uniqueness of being a good friend.</p><p></p><p>3. i would like to own a leadership of being strong and independent. Because i know it will help me.</p><p></p><p>4. I see myself as a kind, hardworking, strong young lady while others sees me as a mean, lazy, weak women. kinda hurts but this world is just full of toxicity.</p><p></p><p>1.1. The decision as a teenager sometimes can be a bad decision and sometimes can be good for me and for who is in my side.</p><p></p><p>my parents decision is good for their child or their family life but it is also not always right</p><p></p><p>1.2.Well, there are two categories of leaders. There are those who are forced leaders as a result of their rank or position. Some people remain ‘forced leaders’ all their lives. Then there are chosen leaders, the ones that people happily accept as their leaders. One becomes a forced leader as a result of education, inteligence and opportunity. It takes much more to transform into an accepted leader.</p><p></p><p>A leader is nothing but an influencer! Stronger his influence, more powerful is the leader. The influence is not necessarily on other men and women! Influence on others is just a biproduct of an effort of a person who effectively influences himself/herself.</p><p></p><p>1.3.A great leader posses a clear vision, is courageous, has integrity, honesty, humility and clear focus.Great leaders help people reach their goals, are not afraid to hire people that might be better than them and take pride in the accomplishments of those they help along the way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> hope it helps so hard to answer that question</p><br />

                        <p>My relationship with my family might not be perfect but could still be considered as the best relationship I ever had. Our relationship with our family can never be perfect for misunderstandings, arguments and other stuff will come along the way. However, this should not hinder us from having a good relationship with them. In times of misunderstandings and arguments, a good communication is the key to sort things out and become okay with our family again. Being in good relationship with our family is not always about being in good terms with them or about being perfect. Family relationship will always have lapses.

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My relationship with my family might not be perfect but could still be considered as the best relationship I ever had. Our relationship with our family can never be perfect for misunderstandings, arguments and other stuff will come along the way. However, this should not hinder us from having a good relationship with them. In times of misunderstandings and arguments, a good communication is the key to sort things out and become okay with our family again. Being in good relationship with our family is not always about being in good terms with them or about being perfect. Family relationship will always have lapses. It is about how we fix things together as a family despite of all the misunderstandings.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p></p><br />

                            26. describe your social relationship with your parents grandparents and the significant others in your family​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>No single type of family dictates which relationships within it are important for children. A number of people may take a personal interest in a particular child and share a concern for them.
</p><p>
</p><p>In today’s multicultural Britain, children grow up within an enormously varied range of family situations. Some children live as part of an extended family of grandparents, aunts and uncles. In many communities this is the normal pattern of family life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although children of parents who divorce and remarry may lose contact with ‘blood’ grandparents, they often have relationships with an extended family of step-brothers and sisters, step-parents and step-grandparents.
</p><p>
</p><p>In some families – especially if the grandparents are no longer alive or are not in close contact – an uncle or aunt, godparent or friend may take on a ‘grandparental’ role.
</p><p>
</p><p>An innovative scheme in South London provides local families with ‘surrogate’ grandparents who share the ethnic background of absent grandparents. Young and old alike have benefited. Children have been able to experience the care and interest of a grandparent and to find out more about their own cultural roots. Children can build on their own sense of identity – which is an important aspect of self-esteem – in this way.
