The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?
4. What social issues or problems did it present?
5. In what way, Social Science can be significant in solving such problem?</a>

Can you explain the political context of the issue/problem/phenomenon? how can political science help explain and address the issue or problem? ( in the philippines)
(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</a>

The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?
4. What social issues or problems did it present?
5. In what way, Social Science can be significant in solving such problem?</h2><br />

It includes the analysis of power relations, decision-making processes, and the interaction between different groups and institutions within society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Economics - This pertains to the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It includes the analysis of market trends, economic policies, and their impact on different sectors of society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Social Sciences - This encompasses various fields of study such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, and history. It involves the examination of human behavior, cultural norms and practices, and social institutions.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>LEVEL 3: Current Issues Found in the Philippines with Explanation</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Political instability and corruption - The Philippines has long been plagued by political instability and corruption, with allegations of vote-buying, graft and corruption, and abuse of power among public officials. This has resulted in a lack of trust in government institutions and political leaders, as well as hindering the country's economic development and social progress.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Income inequality - Despite recent economic growth, income inequality in the Philippines remains a major concern. A significant portion of the population continues to live below the poverty line, while a small percentage of the population controls a disproportionate share of the country's wealth. This creates social tensions and inhibits the country's long-term economic growth potential.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Education - The Philippines faces significant challenges in providing quality education to its citizens, particularly in rural areas. Access to education remains a problem, with many students dropping out due to lack of resources and support. This limits their opportunities for upward mobility and negatively impacts the country's long-term human capital development.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>LEVEL 4: Integration of the 3rd Level</strong></p><p><strong>The three major issues in the Philippines identified in the third level are interconnected and have significant implications for the country's overall development. Political instability and corruption can hinder efforts to address income inequality and improve access to education. Addressing income inequality can help reduce social tensions and promote more inclusive economic growth, which can, in turn, improve access to education and other social services. Improved education can help address income inequality and empower individuals and communities to engage more actively in the political process and demand greater accountability from their leaders.</strong></p><p></p><br />

A recent report by the Centre for Economic Performance and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (both at LSE) emphasises the importance of involving businesses and communities in developing a strategy for inclusive and sustainable recovery. A “better” post-recovery world will undoubtedly also benefit from the well-documented contributions that social sciences make in areas such as improving the resilience of our democracies and financial systems, exposing and addressing social and economic inequalities, and promoting good mental health and more sustainable ways of living.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I'm</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sorry</strong><strong> </strong><strong>kung</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ito</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>muna</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pero</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hanapan</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yung</strong><strong> </strong><strong>iba</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pedeng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong> </strong><strong>comment</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        THE UNTOUCHABLE CHAEBOLS OF SOUTH KOREA | OPEN SECRETSThe documentary talks about the expansive<strong> influence of Chaebols</strong> in Korea. Chaebol is a term for ultra, elite conglomerates in the capitalistic peninsula.<strong>Inequality and social polarization are big issues around the world. </strong>Awareness of the problem that society is divided into 1% versus 99% has increased, and the ‘spoon-to-segment theory’ of gold, silver, bronze, and earth spoons has become a hot topic among young Koreans. This phenomenon shows that capitalism is not a society in which individual efforts can succeed, but the public consciousness that it is a class society has grown from the ground up.  Philippine Context of Conglomerates<strong>JOLLIBEE CORPORATION:</strong> When talking about End of Contractualization, Jollibee is guilt about this. According to reports, Jollibee Foods Corporation fired hundreds of employees after terminating agency service agreements.

(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</h2><br />
