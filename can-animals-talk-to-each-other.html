                                            Activity 2 Imagine that you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds, and thunder. What do you think is he about to tell you? Most likely, this is going to be a weather forecast. You can expect to hear words like 'sunny, 'windy,' and 'overcast. You'll probably hear the use of verbs in the future tense such as "It will be a cold start to the day" or "There will be showers in the afternoon" and others. Depending on the context-a news report, a school lecture, an exchange in a supermarket-you can often predict the kind of words and the style of language that the speaker will use. Our knowledge of the world helps us anticipate the kind of information we are likely to hear. moreover, when we predict the topic of a talk or a conversation, all the related vocabulary stored in our brains is activated to help us better understand what we're listening to. Give your prediction on each of the given situations. Justify your answer. 1. What should we do to avoid such a calamity from happening? cite examples. 2. what would happen if plants and animals under the sea become extinct? why? ​</a>

                                            Let Us practiceActivity 1: Biotic Living with Abiotic FactorsYou have learned that abiotic factors, also called abiotic components,are non-living factors that impact an ecosystem and the associated livingthings. The term "abiotic" comes from the root parts "a- meaning "without",and "bio", meaning "life". Abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, soil, water,atmosphere, and temperature.There are many different types of environments, such as deserts,forests, grasslands, tundra, ocean beaches, and of course, estuaries(connection of fresh and saltwater). Each type of environment containsmany different factors that interact with each other. For instance, a forestenvironment has large trees with smaller bushes, some grasses, rivers,ponds, insects, many different types of small and large animals, soil withorganic matter in it, and usually abundant rainfall. In contrast, a desertenvironment has cactus, small plants, lizards, snakes, smaller animals,sandy and or rocky soil, and low yearly rainfall.The way all of the factors in an environment interact determineswhich organisms can live in that environment. For instance, an alligator,which needs a lot of water to live in, would have a hard time living in adesert that doesn't have much water. Ferns need shade and moist soil to liveand would die in the hot, dry, sunny desert. Polar bears have thick fur coatsto keep warm in the cold, snowy arctic and would have a difficult time ifthey lived in a hot, humid tropical environment.Questions:1. What do we mean when we talk about an "environment?" In yournotebook, write down all of the things that comes to mind when youthink of an "environment".2. From the text above, choose one type of environment and describe it.Also, identify the biotic and abiotic factors that are present in thatenvironment.Paki answer po thank you po in advance ​</a>

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</a>

barnyard’s at risk. Let us remember that we do not own a
special position, the scenario may change, the trap cannot

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</a>

                            6. Let Us practiceActivity 1: Biotic Living with Abiotic FactorsYou have learned that abiotic factors, also called abiotic components,are non-living factors that impact an ecosystem and the associated livingthings. The term "abiotic" comes from the root parts "a- meaning "without",and "bio", meaning "life". Abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, soil, water,atmosphere, and temperature.There are many different types of environments, such as deserts,forests, grasslands, tundra, ocean beaches, and of course, estuaries(connection of fresh and saltwater). Each type of environment containsmany different factors that interact with each other. For instance, a forestenvironment has large trees with smaller bushes, some grasses, rivers,ponds, insects, many different types of small and large animals, soil withorganic matter in it, and usually abundant rainfall. In contrast, a desertenvironment has cactus, small plants, lizards, snakes, smaller animals,sandy and or rocky soil, and low yearly rainfall.The way all of the factors in an environment interact determineswhich organisms can live in that environment. For instance, an alligator,which needs a lot of water to live in, would have a hard time living in adesert that doesn't have much water. Ferns need shade and moist soil to liveand would die in the hot, dry, sunny desert. Polar bears have thick fur coatsto keep warm in the cold, snowy arctic and would have a difficult time ifthey lived in a hot, humid tropical environment.Questions:1. What do we mean when we talk about an "environment?" In yournotebook, write down all of the things that comes to mind when youthink of an "environment".2. From the text above, choose one type of environment and describe it.Also, identify the biotic and abiotic factors that are present in thatenvironment.Paki answer po thank you po in advance ​</h2><br />

A - First Person B - Second Person C. Third Person Objective D - Third Person Limited E - Third Person Omniscient 1. I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</h2><br />

A. The pains in loving someone
B. Unchanging and genuine love
 The story is about the rat who was bothered by the
mouse trap and tried to talk to its friends-asking for help.
Unfortunately, the animals in the farm were not bothered
with the story of the little rat.
 Towards the end of the story, the wife of the farmer got
sick due to the snake’s bite. Due to the circumstances, the
chicken was killed for a hot soup. But, the fever still
progressed and the neighbors came to visit, the pig was
butchered for a food.
 Towards the end of the story, the farmer’s wife died and
the cow was slaughtered to provide meat for all. While rest
of the animal died, the little rat survived. This incident may
happen to all of us, the mouse trap here could be someone’s
problem. The mousetrap cannot catch you at first, but its
effects can be devastating.
 In the story, we learn that when we see the problem of
others. We behave like a blind and do not see the problem
of others. We forget that the problem is also ours. The lack
of community, fellowship and arrogance is the problem that
affects many relationships.
 In a relationship, office, home, friend circle or emotional,
we must always pay attention to the nearby problems, and
need take care of each other.
 So, the next time you hear that someone is facing a
problem and think that it does not concern you, remember
that when there is a rat trap in the house, the whole
barnyard’s at risk. Let us remember that we do not own a
special position, the scenario may change, the trap cannot
get you directly, but its effects can affect you.

A- First Person D-Third Person Limited B - Second Person C. Third Person Objective E - Third Person Omniscient 1. I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</h2><br />
