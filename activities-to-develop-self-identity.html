                            26. Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if not.PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 1.  During puberty, teenagers are struggling with wanting to be accepted and with trying to fit in with their peers.2.  As we grow old, we become conscious with the different changes happen with our bodies.3.  Because of the raging hormones, the moods of the teenagers fluctuate between excitement, anger, anxiety, and depression.4.  As our hormones change, we begin to see the opposite sex in a different light and begin to experience sexual arousal.5.  Sigmund Freud was interested in how social interaction and relationship played a role in the development and growth of human beings.6.  There is no conflict during the puberty stage.7.  Erikson believed that people experience a conflict that serves as a turning point in development.8.  If people successfully deal with the conflict, they become strong in facing their challenges.9.  Identity diffusion is a status that characterizes those who have neither explored the options, nor made a commitment to identity.10.  Identity foreclosure is a status that characterizes those who have made a commitment to an identity without having explored the options.11.  Identity achievement is a status that describes those who are activity exploring in an attempt to establish an identity, but have yet to have made any commitment.12.  Identity moratorium refers to those who after exploration have made a commitment.13.  A great deal of the identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals.14.  The religious views of teens are often similar to the views of their families.15.  The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parent political beliefs.16.  The gender identity of the teens is one of the top issues now a days.17.  Unexamined Ethnic identity is never characterized with a preference for the dominant culture.18.  Ethnic identity may lead to a rejection of the values of the dominant culture.19.  Progress in achieved Ethnic identity if we have a deeper appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage.20.  Ethnic minorities should embrace the identity of their society and their families.21.  Adolescence is a period that is full of challenges.22.  Parents should play a highly supportive role to make their children better in the future.23.  All teenagers want to follow the footsteps of their parents.24.  All teenagers never challenge the authority of their parents.25.  When parents understand the process of adolescent sexual development, they are in a better position to assist their children.26.  Ages 12 to 15 are the age of curiosity and experimentation.27.  Teenagers need to feel a sense of belonging to feel good about their own identity.28.  Positive groups can help us to build healthy emotional and psychological development.29.  Teens never need to feel a sense of belonging to feel good about who they are.30.  Teenagers need to feel a deep sense of belonging in their family.31.  Teenagers who do not feel a sense of belonging from family and friends will pursue intimacy in unhealthy ways.32.  Parents must give their children the opportunity to make some decisions independently for their own stuff.33.  Teenagers with low self-esteem are at risk of being bullied, engaged with drugs and alcohol, and have suicidal thoughts.​</h2><br />
