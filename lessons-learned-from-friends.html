                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Maia has problems not with Brazil but with the family she with whom she is staying.
Gwendolyn and Beatrice are selfish little brats.
Maia leans to be resolute about the things she wants as what her friends, Finn and Clovis did.
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>While Maia finds the mystique of Brazil interesting, <strong>she couldn’t bear the enigmatic attitude of her distant relatives, the Carters who look down at the natives and would complain about everything in Brazil</strong>. As a result, they hardly go out and would often express hate about the place they live in which means Maia must also stay indoors.
The sisters, <strong>Gwendolyn and Beatrice</strong>, Maia’s cousins, <strong>seem to have imbibed the attitude of their parents towards Brazil</strong>. They would also fight even about the littlest of things.
Maia’s two friends, <strong>Clovis and Finn have shown her that one can do what he/she resolves to do if he/she sets sights to it</strong>. They were able to pursue what they want to do with Clovis returning to England disguised as Finn, the rich heir, so he can go back to his foster mother while Finn who used Clovis’ identity has been free to roam Brazil in search of his mother’s tribe, the Xanti.<p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Our last day of the school year, three months and a week after we went virtual, brought a strange sadness. After the whirlwind and stress of the last few months, the end felt like a slow exhale instead of a bang—or, as a student said, one of those balloons that float to the ceiling outside your grasp and then slowly deflate on their own. At the end of class, we waved goodbye and said, “Thanks,” and then one by one, my high school students clicked off, leaving me staring at my own face on the screen.
</p><p>
</p><p>Things moved so quickly since mid-March that it’s been hard to stop and let everything sink in. When I got the results of my first Covid test back negative, it was a poignant reminder that other people in my community—people I know—have not been as lucky. Some have died. As I write this, for the first quiet moment in a while, I have time to feel deeply sad for them.
</p><p>
</p><p>I imagine it will take a while for teachers, staff, and students to have enough quiet moments to come to terms with all we have experienced (if we ever do), as Covid-19 spikes and virtual learning stretches on. But at the same time, many of us have also found new ways to be flexible, connect, and grapple with the world around us that we might have avoided or skipped over before. Some of these changes or insights I hope to take with me into this coming school year, whatever that may look like.
</p><p>
</p><p>CREATING TIME FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
</p><p>While we were learning from home, we were also alert to events outside our school that prompted students and teachers to engage in a deeper way than the previous flow of the school day provided. The large (masked) gatherings to protest the death of George Floyd and centuries of institutionalized racism were the first time many of us left our homes in New Jersey.
</p><p>
</p><p>While students and teachers discuss race and equity openly at school, having regular discussions for the entire school had been challenging before, due to our bell schedule, which has no common lunches, along with students’ extracurricular commitments to clubs and teams. Now, we all had time, and our school’s Diversity Alliance club (of which I am a co-advisor) held three open discussions, initiated and led by students. Many students started their own online fundraisers for Covid-19 first responders, and others launched online actions to support Black Lives Matter.
</p><p>
</p><p>After these experiences, I’m left wondering in what ways the “normal” school day prevents civic engagement and deeper contemplation that help students connect school learning with real life rather than conduct simulations of it in model congresses.
</p><p>
</p><p>RAISING SELF-AWARENESS
</p><p>A project unique to this time was a “Covid Journal,” in which students tracked the news and their responses to it in an electronic or paper journal. About a month into the project, students asked if they could stop responding to the news and just write, and their entries became more personal.
</p><p>
</p><p>Reflecting on their journals at the end of the trimester, students said that they noticed a shift in themselves from the initial shock and uncertainty to feelings of resignation or acceptance of their quarantined lives. As the months passed, their journals also became less tethered to the outside world and showed that time had taken on an elastic quality, stretching endlessly in some days or hours, contracting quickly in others. By the end of the project, many noted how their mental well-being coincided with their attention to breaking news, which seemed like a lesson they would take with them.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Friend,</p><p></p><p>I know it’s tough and that everyday is filled with uncertainty. One thing is for sure, however, and that is the fact that you are not alone. I share in your feelings of anxiety. I miss being able to see people without fear. Many people are experiencing all of these strong emotions and I know how overwhelming it can become. In the face of hardship, we have to stay strong.</p><p></p><p>Strength can mean many things. It doesn’t mean you can’t be sad. It doesn’t mean you can’t cry. Being strong can be something as little as acknowledging your feelings, or pushing through a hard day but still getting up the next morning. Just know that you have made it this far. You are strong and there are always people who will listen to you.</p><p></p><p>If you ever do need to talk, don't hesitate to call me.</p><p></p><p>Love,</p><p>Your best friend</p><p></p><br />
