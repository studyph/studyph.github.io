SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II.

                                            3. research provides many benefits to various fields In the area of Accounting, Business, and Management (ABM), researches can help design a new product or service, figuring out what is needed and ensure that the development of a product is highly targeted towards demand. Businessmen can also utilize research results to guarantee sufficient distribution of their products and decide where they need to increase their product distribution. Conducting researches can also help a business determine whether now is the proper time to open another branch or whether it needs to apply for a new loan. It may also help a small business decide if a procedure or strategy should be changed to meet the requirements of the customer base. Research is important for any organization to remain competitive in the market. The primary function of research in ABM is to correctly determine its customers and their preferences, establish the enterprise in the most feasible location, deliver quality goods and services, analyze what the competitors are doing and find ways on how to continuously satisfy the growing and varied needs of the clients. In the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). medical practitioners, for example, conduct researches to obtain significant information about disease trends and risk factors, results of various health interventions, patterns of care, and health care costs and use. The different approaches to research provide complementary insights.

Imagine being told you could not be an engineer or a truck driver, or even an airline pilot because 'girls don't do those jobs'. Imagine being told not to listen to that radio station because 'Bad Bay Elvis' and rock and roll music encouraged indecent behavior. Imagine putting on a tie or a hat and gloves to go out. These values and social conventions were generally accepted as 'correct' by parents of teenagers in the 1950s, and teenagers were not expected to question them. Before we complain about life in the 21st century we should look at how fortunate we are. Career choices for girls in the 1950s were mostly limited to becoming a hairdresser, nurse, or teacher, until they married. This would be unthinkable today. Women are having children in their late 30s not early 20s, and often their families are planned around their careers. In-co-educational schools girls often top the classes in Physics, Chemistry Technology, or Mathematics - traditionally scen as boys' subjccts. When the army recruitment officer visits, as many girls as boys are in the audience. Achieving your potential is no longer limited by your gender, and this must be a good thing. Another aspect of modern teenage life that reflects these immense social changes is in what is acceptable to wear. You might say that 'anything goes'. If you look at any group of teenagers wearing mufti you will see many different personal styles. One person has four or five body piercings, another has dreadlocked hair, the third shows off his boxers above his low-slung jeans; and 3​</a>

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on.

                            21. 3. research provides many benefits to various fields In the area of Accounting, Business, and Management (ABM), researches can help design a new product or service, figuring out what is needed and ensure that the development of a product is highly targeted towards demand. Businessmen can also utilize research results to guarantee sufficient distribution of their products and decide where they need to increase their product distribution. Conducting researches can also help a business determine whether now is the proper time to open another branch or whether it needs to apply for a new loan. It may also help a small business decide if a procedure or strategy should be changed to meet the requirements of the customer base. Research is important for any organization to remain competitive in the market. The primary function of research in ABM is to correctly determine its customers and their preferences, establish the enterprise in the most feasible location, deliver quality goods and services, analyze what the competitors are doing and find ways on how to continuously satisfy the growing and varied needs of the clients. In the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). medical practitioners, for example, conduct researches to obtain significant information about disease trends and risk factors, results of various health interventions, patterns of care, and health care costs and use. The different approaches to research provide complementary insights.

These values and social conventions were generally accepted as 'correct' by parents of teenagers in the 1950s, and teenagers were not expected to question them. Before we complain about life in the 21st century we should look at how fortunate we are. Career choices for girls in the 1950s were mostly limited to becoming a hairdresser, nurse, or teacher, until they married. This would be unthinkable today.
