Effective communication is backed up by facts, figures, and real-life examples or situations. This will makethe receiver to understand the message better.9. The speaker should include everything that the receiver needs to hear, respond, react, or evaluate properly.S/he should be able to convey all pertinent details so listener or audience will be able to grasp the intendedmessage.10.

It implies the use of simple and specific words to express ideas. When the speaker focuses on specific ideas,it will not confuse the audience.12. Avoiding mistakes in grammar helps to boost the credibility and effectiveness of the message, and at thesame time it eliminates negative impact on the audience.13. The message should be direct or straight to the point and should be expressed in the least possible numberof words. Irrelevant information should not be included.14. The speaker should give high regard and courtesy to audience's background information such as his/herculture, education, religion, status, mood, feelings, and needs. This will result in building rapport orconnection with the audience.Direction: Try to think of ways on how to lessen if not eliminate the barriers in the following situations:15.
