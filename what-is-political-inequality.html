</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>Inflation </strong>causes trouble for <strong>economic </strong>systems in four interrelated ways. First, inflation erodes the money unit's purchasing power- the so-called "inflation tax." Anticipation of further erosion reduces people's desire to hold money and other assets denominated in the money unit.<strong>Climate Change</strong> is an issue <strong>Envrionmental </strong>issue that  includes both global warming driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.<strong>Price Votality</strong> is the <strong>Economic </strong>Issue which means price fluctuations of a commodity. The degree of variation, not the level of prices, defines a volatile market. Since price is a function of supply and demand, it follows that volatility is a result of the underlying supply and demand characteristics of the market.
<strong>Depressive Disorder</strong> is Depression a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It is a Issue deals with <strong>Health and Disease.</strong><strong>Freedom of Media</strong> or freedom of the press is an issue about <strong>Techonology</strong>, it is the freedom of communication &amp; expression through vehicles including various electronic media &amp; published materials. While such freedom mostly implies the absence of interference from an overreaching state, its preservation may be sought through constitutional or other protection. <strong>Pollution </strong>is an <strong>Environemntal</strong> Issue that is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.
<strong>Killing of Political Activists</strong> is an issue about <strong>Political, </strong>in this issue the innocent people are being killed because of some evil politicians.<strong>Racial Discrimination</strong> is when a person is treated less favourably than another person in a similar situation because of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin or immigrant status. It is identified as <strong>Racism or Prejeducise</strong> issues.<strong>Gender Inequality </strong>deals with the social process by which men and women are not treated equally. The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, or cultural norms prevalent in society. Also considered as a<strong> Racism or Prejudice</strong> issue.<p></p><p>Hope it helps, these answers are based on my learnings, please correct me if I'm wrong. :)</p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For the most time, most capitalist countries have been highly unequal. The period around WWI and WWII form an exception since the wars destroyed much of the accumulated wealth. Yet, starting in the 1980ies, inequalities started to rise again. Political institutions might reduce income inequalities through transfers, progressive taxes and provision of subsidised services, like health care. These measures are more developed in Western Europe compared to the US and the East Asian high-income economies.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope can help you</p><br />

                            14. what is the relationship between the presence of political dynasties and issues of standards of living, human development and inequality?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Political dynasties have long been a feature of the Philippine political landscape. They are typically characterized as families that have established their political or economic dominance in a province and have coordinated efforts to move on to involvement in national government or other positions of national politics that treats people prominence. Political dynasties usually have a strong, consolidated support base concentrated around the province in which they are dominant. Members of such dynasties usually do not limit their involvement to strictly political activities, and have been found participating in business or culture-related activities."</p><p></p><p>Political dynasties started emerging after the Philippine Revolution when the First Republic of the Philippines was established. With the decline of Spain's economic power and international prestige in the 19th century, the expansion of British and American influence around the world, and the political current of emergent nationalism among the children of the economically enfranchised bourgeois, the power of the peninsulares', or Spanish-born aristocracy declined propitiously. Following the defeat of the Spanish in the Spanish–American War, the surviving members of the Spanish or Spanish-sanctioned landholding elite and the newly ascendant merchant elite, who were mostly foreign expatriates or of Chinese origin, formed a de facto aristocracy to replace the power vacuum the Spanish had left. Aristocracy survived and prospered under the American colonial regime, and remained a permanent fixture in Philippine society even following the independence of the Philippines was finally confirmed following the devastation of the Philippines under the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. Over the years, political dynasties continued to adapt, as newer dynasties emerged to fill power vacuums left behind by the extinction of older dynasties. The majority of the available positions in Philippine government are currently held by members of these political dynasties. Notable Philippine political dynasties include the Aquino, Marcos, Arroyo, Binay, Duterte, Sansano, and Roxas families." There has been a lot of debate regarding the effects political dynasties have on the political and economic status of Philippine society. Despite the negative reaction of the populace towards political dynasties and the association between dynastic activities and corruption,it is only prohibited in the members of the youth-oriented</p><p></p><p>Sorry kung mahaba hehe</p><p>Sana po nakatulong po ito</p><p>:)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Political dynasties have long been a feature of the Philippine political landscape. They are typically characterized as families that have established their political or economic dominance in a province and have coordinated efforts to move on to involvement in national government or other positions of national politics that treats people prominence. Political dynasties usually have a strong, consolidated support base concentrated around the province in which they are dominant. Members of such dynasties usually do not limit their involvement to strictly political activities, and have been found participating in business or culture-related activities."</p><p></p><p>2.Democracies are widely touted to be able to facilitate and sustain broader and more inclusive  processes of economic and human development. Scholars associate political democracy with  more predictable long-run economic growth, enhanced macroeconomic stability, more rational  management of economic and political shocks and crises, and improved distributional outcomes.
In theory, democracies guarantee equal voice in government decision-making through a range of  mechanisms like one-person-one-vote, equality in political participation, and free speech. A  democracy has the potential to cultivate an environment that is responsive to the needs of its  citizens that, often, brings about higher levels of human capital investments and more inclusive and equitable social and economic outcomes. However, underdeveloped democratic institutions  could be associated with weak political participation and thus produce, in some cases, political  dynasties. Still, political dynasties can exist in any democracy regardless of its structure. A brief  survey of the literature suggests that the share of legislators with dynastic links to past  parliaments range from as low as 6 percent in the United States (Dal Bo et al. 2009) or 10  percent in Argentina (Rossi 2009) to as high as 37 to 40 percent in Japan and Mexico (Asako et  al. 2010). In the case of the Philippines, the share of political dynasties is estimated between 50  percent (Querubin 2010a) and 70 percent (calculations of the authors) if the links to the local  government units are included in the count. </p><p></p><p>3.These developments – in the central bureaucracy  and local patron-client relations, as well as in the  expansion of governmental economic  responsibilities – highlight the seeming  strengthening of patrimonial features within the  postcolonial Philippine state. Because these patterns  became more pronounced in recent times, as access  to the state began to be more important for securing  patronage and rents, the term neopatrimonial helps  to capture the historical sequence.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
