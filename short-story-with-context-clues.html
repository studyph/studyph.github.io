                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everything changed when 2020 came, the year that they often call as the morbid year. Most Filipinos are in the state of shock and panic, but my family and myself remained optimistic about our future. Lockdown was implemented, and because this is the first time our country experienced a pandemic, most people show ignorance about it, failing to understand the risks and danger of going outside. If we all union and make each other understand, then our pandemic situation will be much better. The government should also confer to its countrymen to make their future plans.</p><br />
