                    <p>Because the original meaning of the word, philosophy, does not give us much forspecific content, we will turn to descriptive definitions. A descriptive definition ofphilosophy is that it seeks to describe its functions, goals, and reasons for existence.We turn to consider several definitions of philosophy. These will include the historicalapproach, philosophy as criticism, philosophy as the analysis of language, philosophyas a program of change, philosophy as a set of questions and answers, and philosophyas a world-view. Along the way we will also analyze the definitions and attempt toreach some conclusions about this analysis . Explanation​</p>

                                            An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                            1. Because the original meaning of the word, philosophy, does not give us much forspecific content, we will turn to descriptive definitions. A descriptive definition ofphilosophy is that it seeks to describe its functions, goals, and reasons for existence.We turn to consider several definitions of philosophy. These will include the historicalapproach, philosophy as criticism, philosophy as the analysis of language, philosophyas a program of change, philosophy as a set of questions and answers, and philosophyas a world-view. Along the way we will also analyze the definitions and attempt toreach some conclusions about this analysis . Explanation​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philosophy is a combination of two Greek words, philein sophia, meaning lover of wisdom. In ancient times a lover of wisdom could be related to any area where intelligence was expressed. This could be in business, politics, human relations, or carpentry and other skills. Philosophy had a "wholeness" approach to life in antiquity. In contrast to this, some modern definitions restrict philosophy to what can be known by science or the analysis of language.
</p><p>
</p><p>In today's world there is a popular use of the word philosophy. Philosophy is a term applied to almost any area of life. Some questions may express this general attitude: what is your philosophy of business? banking? driving a car? or your philosophy of the use of money? If this popular misuse of the word were to prevail, one may admit that anyone who thinks seriously about any subject is a philosopher. If we do this, we are ignoring the academic disciplines, or study of philosophy. If this very general definition is accepted, everyone becomes a philosopher. It becomes true, paradoxically, that when everyone is a philosopher, no one is a philosopher. This becomes so loose a definition that philosophy becomes meaningless as a definition. If this definition prevailed, it would mean that a philosopher is anyone who says he is a philosopher. Because of this inadequacy it becomes apparent that we have to look elsewhere for a definition of philosophy.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            2. POST ASSESSMENT. Provide the correct answer in the space provided. 1. It is essentially an opinion based on evidence about a theme, style, setting, or historical or political context. 2. Follows the belief that objects have meaning because that it was it has been defined as through language. 3. Examines a literary work's form to determine its true meaning (not what the audiences think but what the text says). 4. Attempts to explain the behavioral underpinnings of the characters within the selection, analyzing the actions and thoughts committed fall under any of the identifiable neuroses, whether a psychological disorder is evident among them. 5. Concerns with the analysis of the clash of opposing social classes in society, namely, the ruling class (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat) as it shaped the events that transpired in the story. 6.

                            6. An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review.
