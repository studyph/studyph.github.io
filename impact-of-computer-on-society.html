(FOR COMPUTER ESSAY</h2><br />
                        <p>The impact of the internet on society can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. On one hand, the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business, making our lives easier, more efficient, and more productive. It has created new opportunities for education, entertainment, and social interaction, connecting people from all over the world in ways that were once unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the internet has also created new problems and challenges, such as cyberbullying, online harassment, addiction, and privacy issues. It has given rise to fake news, disinformation, and propaganda, spreading misinformation and undermining trust in democratic institutions. It has also contributed to the digital divide, exacerbating inequalities and creating new forms of exclusion and marginalization.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the impact of the internet on society is complex and multifaceted, and its effects depend largely on how we choose to use it. While it has the potential to bring about positive change and innovation, it also poses significant risks and challenges that must be addressed.</p><br />

2. Discuss the impact of social media on communication and society.
3. Analyze the effects of technology on privacy and security.
4. Briefly explain the concept of blockchain and its potential uses.</h2><br />
                        <p>1. Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. In other words, it allows users to access and use technology resources remotely, rather than having to own and maintain them locally. Cloud computing has significant implications for the IT era as it allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the way we use and access technology. This has led to increased efficiency and cost savings for businesses and individuals alike, as well as new opportunities for innovation and growth.</p><p></p><p>2. Social media has had a profound impact on communication and society. It has made it easier for people to connect with one another and share information, ideas, and content. However, social media has also raised concerns about the spread of misinformation, the impact on mental health, and the erosion of privacy. Social media has also been used to organize political movements, both positive and negative. Social media also changed the way businesses communicate with customers and how they advertise. Social media has also created new career opportunities in digital marketing, content creation, and social media management.</p><p></p><p>3. Technology has had a significant impact on privacy and security. On one hand, technology has made it easier for individuals to access and share information, but it has also made it easier for organizations and governments to collect and use data without individuals’ knowledge or consent. As a result, privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent, including issues such as data breaches, identity theft, and surveillance. At the same time, technology has also been used to improve security and protect against these threats, through the use of encryption, firewalls, and other security measures.</p><p></p><p>4. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and transparent transactions of digital assets. It is a decentralized and transparent system that uses cryptography to keep transactions secure. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and each block is linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks. The potential uses of blockchain technology are vast and varied, including financial services, supply chain management, and even voting systems. Blockchain can also be used for creating a transparent and tamper-proof record of any digital transaction, which could be useful in various industries.</p><p></p><p>- Servion</p><br />

                            13. how does management in computer make an impact in our society?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Management in computer has a significant impact on society in several ways.<br /></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>First, computer management plays a crucial role in the efficient functioning of businesses, organizations, and government agencies. With the increasing reliance on technology in the workplace, computer management is essential for ensuring that systems are running smoothly, and that data is secure and easily accessible. This allows for greater productivity and increased efficiency in various industries, which can lead to economic growth and job creation.</p><p></p><p>Second, computer management plays a vital role in the advancement of various fields such as medicine, education, transportation, and communication. For example, computer management can improve healthcare by enabling electronic medical records and telemedicine, which can enhance healthcare delivery and reduce medical errors. In education, computer management can help to improve the delivery of information and instruction, making it more effective and accessible.</p><p></p><p>Third, computer management plays a critical role in the security of digital information. With the increasing use of technology in our personal and professional lives, computer management is essential to ensure that sensitive information is protected from cyber threats such as hacking and data breaches. This can help to protect individuals and organizations from financial loss and reputational damage.</p><p></p><p>In summary, computer management has a wide-reaching impact on society by making businesses, organizations, and government agencies more efficient, advancing various fields, and ensuring the security of digital information, which is essential for protecting individuals and organizations from financial loss and reputational damage.</p><br />

                            21.  Home computers are used more extensively, than ever for tasks such as banking, investing, shopping, and communicating. Do you see this trend as having a positive or a negative impact on our society and economy? Do you plan to use a computer in these ways? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        Computers have positive and negative impacts. In the positive side it helps people to do their work in a more efficient way it could be household related businesses instead of paying it through their offices you can do it from home with only using a mobile device another thing is communication it helps people connect from around the globe, it can help them with work efficiency. The down side of it is that it also disconnects us from reality, people nowadays are more comfortable talking through a phone or texting rather than talking to them in person another fact is that it can be addicting, but all of these has simple solution. In the end I think computers has more positive impact in the economy and the society it helped us move more efficient and makes the work easier, and we only have to control and know our limits when using them to fix its negative impact.<br />
