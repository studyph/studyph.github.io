The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

The Happy Sheep
All through the night the happy sheep
Lie in the meadow grass asleep.
Their wool keeps out the frost and rain 
Until the sun comes around again.
They have no buttons undo.
Nor hair to brush like me and you.
And with the light they lift their beds,
Or rise and walk around and eat
The carpet underneath their feet.
QUESTION: In the poem, what makes the sheep happy?

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</a>

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

Poem: When The House is EmptyNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing. At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or confused. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet, I want others to be about me. I dread the moment when the house is empty. If only they would talk to me. There are moments, most unexpected, when something inside me tries to assure me that I* don’t really mind so much, not so very much, after all. Love is not the whole of a man’s life. I was happy before I ever met H. I’ve plenty of what are called resources…. One is ashamed to listen to this voice but it seems for a little to be making out a good case. Then comes a sudden jab of red-hot memory and all this “common sense” vanishes like an ant in the mouth of a furnace… And no one told me about the laziness of grief. Not only writing but even reading a letter is too much. Even shaving. What does it matter now whether my cheek is rough or smooth? They say an unhappy man wants distraction on a cold night, he’d rather lie there shivering than get up and find one.​</a>

                            10. THE SONG IS BELIEVER
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</h2><br />

The Happy Sheep
All through the night the happy sheep
Lie in the meadow grass asleep.
Their wool keeps out the frost and rain 
Until the sun comes around again.
They have no buttons undo.
Nor hair to brush like me and you.
And with the light they lift their beds,
Or rise and walk around and eat
The carpet underneath their feet.

And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</h2><br />

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

                        <p><strong>The theme and the message of Jose Garcia Villa's poem written in 1942.</strong></p><p></p><p>A poem surely has its own<strong> theme and message</strong>, and this is an unwritten rule for all poets. We can identify the theme by looking at the <strong>poem </strong>overall, and trying to decide the theme in each stanza. I am sure that even one line gives a hint or clue in deciding the theme, and this holds true for the poem's message as well.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jose Garcia Villa's poem</strong> that was written during the Japanese occupation era talks about fighting against a certain power. I believe that the poet here refers to the colonizers, but the poet skillfully uses God in each of the line. In addition, the poet also conveys the <strong>message </strong>through explaining that love will win in the end, so that the suffering would surely end someday.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>identifying the theme of a poem</strong> from https://brainly.ph/question/29580608</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            30. Can you identify the character of the poem? If so, define the gender of the persona by selecting a specific stanza that supports your understanding of the character's sexuality? Poem: When The House is EmptyNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing. At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or confused. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet, I want others to be about me. I dread the moment when the house is empty. If only they would talk to me. There are moments, most unexpected, when something inside me tries to assure me that I* don’t really mind so much, not so very much, after all. Love is not the whole of a man’s life. I was happy before I ever met H. I’ve plenty of what are called resources…. One is ashamed to listen to this voice but it seems for a little to be making out a good case. Then comes a sudden jab of red-hot memory and all this “common sense” vanishes like an ant in the mouth of a furnace… And no one told me about the laziness of grief. Not only writing but even reading a letter is too much. Even shaving. What does it matter now whether my cheek is rough or smooth? They say an unhappy man wants distraction on a cold night, he’d rather lie there shivering than get up and find one.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Based on the given stanza, there is no definitive indication of the persona's gender or sexuality. The poem does not provide any explicit or implicit references to the gender or sexuality of the character. The persona appears to be experiencing grief and feelings of loneliness and isolation in an empty house. The focus of the poem is on the character's emotional state and the various sensations and thoughts that they are experiencing as a result of their grief. Therefore, it is not appropriate to define the gender of the persona based on the given stanza.</p><br />
