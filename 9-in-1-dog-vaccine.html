                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Finite set: A set is said to be a finite set if it is either void set or the process of counting of elements surely comes to an end is called a finite set.</p><p></p><p>In a finite set the element can be listed if it has a limited i.e. countable by natural number 1, 2, 3, ……… and the process of listing terminates at a certain natural number N.</p><p></p><p>The number of distinct elements counted in a finite set S is denoted by n(S). The number of elements of a finite set A is called the order or cardinal number of a set A and is symbolically denoted by n(A).</p><p></p><p>Thus, if the set A be that of the English alphabets, then n(A) = 26: For, it contains 26 elements in it.
