                                            Short Essay! In one Elements of a Short Story, the Protogonist seems to play now the character of an Antagonist what are your thoughts about this dynamism? Answer:The Dynamic character (protagonist) is one who changes significantly throughout the story, whereas a round character (antagonist) is simply one who is interesting and layered. A character can be round without ever undergoing any changes throughout a story, so characters can be round without being dynamic. however, my thoughts about this dynamism is that The development of a dynamic character is often subtle and unstated and is not due to a change in the character’s circumstances. A dynamic character is one who learns a lesson or changes as a person (either for better or for worse. TAMA PO BA TO? huhuhu​</a>

                        <p></p><p></p><p>1. What does the illustration suggest</p><strong>An illustration is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process, designed for integration in print and digital published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films. An illustration is typically created by an illustrator.</strong><p>2.How is it related to the story</p><strong>The title related to the story stories do it with a title. So I think titles are extremely important. A title creates anticipation and expectation or, perhaps, disinterest. Often the title is what will determine whether or not someone reads a story.</strong><p>3. Who among the characters in the story best symbolizes this picture? Why?</p><strong>For me, it was the narrator’s family. They were above the rich’s man family. Just like what I said, the narrator’s family is poor but they have pure happiness and they enjoy their life even though they don’t have that much money like the rich man.</strong><p>4. What Filipino belief or value can help address this issue and why?</p><strong>Hospitality. I guess? For me, it was hospitality because us, Filipino would love to help people in need, whenever someone need help we always open our houses/heart to help people.</strong><p>5. As a student how can you help make a change in this kind of situation</p><strong>As a student, I would like to encourage people to enjoy their life and look at everyone as their friend.
