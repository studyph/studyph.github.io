On February 4, 2020, a bill proposing the legalization of divorce in the Philippines was 
approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations in the House of 
Representatives. Currently, the Philippines and the Vatican are the only two sovereign states in 
the world that still prohibit divorce.

The Supreme Court heard a long-awaited argument on Tuesday that could open the door 
to same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.
The case which was filed by a gay lawyer named Jesus Falcis in 2015, urges the court to 
declare the marriage restriction in the country’s Family Code – which limits marriage to one man 
and one woman – unconstitutional. It also asks the court to recognize marriage equality in the 
Philippines. Falcis argues that the marriage restrictions violate his rights to due process, equal 
protection, and forming a family under the Philippine Constitution.

waste water, accidental oil leakage, marine dumping, chemical pesticides and fertilizers, burning 
of fossil fuels, animal waste, urban development, global warming, radioactive waste, and leakage 
from sewer lines. There is less water available for drinking, cooking, irrigating crops, and washing
because of pollution.

                                            Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</a>

Then, fill in the given table below with the corresponding information needed. According to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, coastal ecosystems of the Philippines are very productive and represent the huge amount of natural resources. It provides food and livelihood to many people. However, it is also the most geologically active zone on Earth. Coastal processes in this zone may result to erosion, submersion and saltwater intrusion. These effects could lead to different hazards such as: 1. Barrier islands movement. Barrier islands are formed due to deposition of sand brought by waves protecting the mainland from damage due to large waves. It also provides habitat for the aquatic wildlife. It can be destroyed or moved by erosion on the contrary. 2. Flooding It also destroys habitat and may lead to great erosion. The main cause of this hazard is the submersion or sea level rise, a climate change phenomenon through which ocean water volume increases, ice sheets and glaciers melt and occurrence of thermal expansion 3.fresh water contamination. Intrusion or movement of siline water aquifers can lead to the degradation or contamination of ground water including drinking water resources. Intrusion is aided by hydraulic action but triggered by human activities ps need lang po para lang po makapasa para po sa 2nd sem thank u in advance​</a>

                                            Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</a>

Hindi lamang ang presidente ang dapat kumikilos, sya ang nag gguide sa lahat sa kung paano patatakbuhin ang bansa. Bagama't marami parin ang hadlang sa kanyang mga aksyon at ipinatutupad, magbase tayo sa kung ano ang nararanasang komplikasyon at suliranin ng bansa. Isa na yung pandemya, hindi ito maiiwasan pero hindi patay ang paraan. Ang pangulo ay gumagawa ng solusyon at umaaksyon para sa ikaluluwag at ikakaahon ng bansa. He implemented ECQ para atleast mareduce yung number ng cases but still hindi parin pala yun ang makakatulong. Minsan yung misong tao nalang talaga ang problema.

On February 4, 2020, a bill proposing the legalization of divorce in the Philippines was 
approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations in the House of 
Representatives. Currently, the Philippines and the Vatican are the only two sovereign states in 
the world that still prohibit divorce.

The Supreme Court heard a long-awaited argument on Tuesday that could open the door 
to same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.
The case which was filed by a gay lawyer named Jesus Falcis in 2015, urges the court to 
declare the marriage restriction in the country’s Family Code – which limits marriage to one man 
and one woman – unconstitutional. It also asks the court to recognize marriage equality in the 
Philippines. Falcis argues that the marriage restrictions violate his rights to due process, equal 
protection, and forming a family under the Philippine Constitution.

The key causes of the water pollution are industrial waste, mining activities, sewage and 
waste water, accidental oil leakage, marine dumping, chemical pesticides and fertilizers, burning 
of fossil fuels, animal waste, urban development, global warming, radioactive waste, and leakage 
from sewer lines. There is less water available for drinking, cooking, irrigating crops, and washing
because of pollution.

                            19. Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</h2><br />

According to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, coastal ecosystems of the Philippines are very productive and represent the huge amount of natural resources. It provides food and livelihood to many people. However, it is also the most geologically active zone on Earth. Coastal processes in this zone may result to erosion, submersion and saltwater intrusion. These effects could lead to different hazards such as: 1. Barrier islands movement. Barrier islands are formed due to deposition of sand brought by waves protecting the mainland from damage due to large waves. It also provides habitat for the aquatic wildlife. It can be destroyed or moved by erosion on the contrary. 2. Flooding It also destroys habitat and may lead to great erosion. The main cause of this hazard is the submersion or sea level rise, a climate change phenomenon through which ocean water volume increases, ice sheets and glaciers melt and occurrence of thermal expansion 3.fresh water contamination. Intrusion or movement of siline water aquifers can lead to the degradation or contamination of ground water including drinking water resources. Intrusion is aided by hydraulic action but triggered by human activities ps need lang po para lang po makapasa para po sa 2nd sem thank u in advance​</h2><br />

                            28. Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</h2><br />
