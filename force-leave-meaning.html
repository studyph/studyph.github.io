What is the probability that five planes depart during a particular 30-second period?</p><p></p><p>The probability that five planes depart during a particular 30-second period is given by the Poisson distribution with mean 5. The probability of this event can be calculated using the formula P(k; lambda) = (lambda^k * e^-lambda) / k!.

To find P(x &lt; k), we can sum the probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 planes departing. Using the Poisson distribution formula, we get P(0; 5) + P(1; 5) + P(2; 5) = (5^0 * e^-5) / 0! + (5^1 * e^-5) / 1! + (5^2 * e^-5) / 2! = 0.0067 + 0.0533 + 0.1463 = 0.2063. The probability of at least two planes departing is then 1 - P(x &lt; k) = 1 - 0.2063 = 0.7937.</p><p></p><p>a.
