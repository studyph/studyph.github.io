1. What is the effects of switching from cigarette smoking to vaping among selected users?
2. Is there significant differences in the lifestyle of the cigarette smokers and vape smokers?
3. What are the factors that affects the behavioral change in student’s behavior using social media?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To answer the question, "What is the effect of switching from cigarette smoking to vaping among selected users?", a suitable statistical tool would be a randomized controlled trial or an observational study. A randomized controlled trial would involve randomly assigning participants to either a group that switches from cigarette smoking to vaping or a control group that continues smoking cigarettes. An observational study would involve collecting data on a group of people who have already made the switch from smoking to vaping and comparing them to a group of smokers. Justification: A randomized controlled trial or observational study would allow researchers to gather quantitative data on the effects of switching from smoking to vaping, such as changes in health outcomes or smoking habits. This type of data is necessary to accurately assess the effects of switching from smoking to vaping.</p><p></p><p>To answer the question, "Is there a significant difference in the lifestyle of cigarette smokers and vape smokers?", a suitable statistical tool would be a t-test or ANOVA. A t-test would be used if the data is normally distributed and the sample sizes are similar, while ANOVA would be used if the data is not normally distributed or if the sample sizes are different. Justification: A t-test or ANOVA would allow researchers to compare the lifestyles of cigarette smokers and vape smokers and determine if there are significant differences between the two groups. This type of analysis is necessary to understand the potential impacts of switching from smoking to vaping on lifestyle factors.</p><p></p><p>To answer the question, "What are the factors that affect the behavioral change in student's behavior using social media?", a suitable statistical tool would be multiple regression analysis. Justification: Multiple regression analysis would allow researchers to examine the relationship between multiple independent variables (e.g. social media use, peer influence, parental influence) and a dependent variable (student behavior). This type of analysis is necessary to identify the specific factors that may be influencing student behavior on social media.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Describe how these occurred.  <p>Not my personal experience, but my parents. My father works in a foreign company that hires both local and foreign workers. The social inequality here is that foreigners are paid more in our own country than the local ones even if they produce the same type of work. I recognize that foreigners should be paid more because of legalities but it is too much.  </p><p></p>2.	From these experience, take time to analyze these experiences and how does each event tell in relation to poverty, wealth, inequality, or privilege.  <p>These experiences are racial inequality and neo-colonialism. In our country, foreigners are favored more. Thus, the answer for solving poverty and wealth inequality never seem to end.  </p><p></p>3.	Reflect on what you have learned from examining your social class in your life.  <p></p><p>I have learned that social stratifications are very harmful. Even if there is a social mobility, people from the bottom are prevented to go up. There are a lot of cases of discrimination. Also, the elites presents poverty as the problem of the individuals and of society.  </p><p></p>4.	Suggest solutions to the experience you shared and how it can be avoided.  <p></p><p>The reasons why the best people in the country move out and be of use to other countries are because of this maltreatment. They should treat workers better.  </p>5. Is there something that the government can do to help you with the problems you and your social class are now facing especially during this time of pandemic?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You are tasked to make your own Social Class Autobiography. In this activity you are given a chance to tell described the social class where you currently belong to (upper, middle, lower). </p><p></p><p><strong>MY SOCIAL CLASS AUTOBIOGRAPHY</strong>
</p><p> I grew up in a lower-class family. We were worried back then on how to find foods and how to pay for our bills. Due to poverty, I cannot attend school gatherings which resulted to bullying. I was bullied by my classmates because of the almost ancient clothes like that I'm wearing at school and a backpack that is obviously reused every school year.
</p><p>By then, I realized that everyone is leveled and respected according to their social class. I then told myself to study and work harder so that I will become successful in the future and promised myself to never suffer the kind of humiliation I felt and experienced back then.  </p><p>
</p><p>One thing is for sure, if you are bullied and become a laughing stock because of poverty, make them respect you through your perseverance and class performance, which I did.  </p><p>I hope the government will focus on people from the silver linings. The government increases job opportunities by building a government-owned company. They can also give scholarship for those family members who belong to lower-class and has all what it takes to succeed and be a breadwinner to his/her family.
