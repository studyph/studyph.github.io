                                            ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</a>

                                            Mia decides to create a study group for the preparation of their exars. She invites
her friends Anna, Matthew, and Jane to join the said group. Anna accepts the
invitation of Mia because she likes to ask and listen to others in order to
understand a certain lesson that she didn't understand well. Also, Matthew
decides to join the study group, but he informs Mia to be patient on him because
he didn't want to just sit while studying, and Mia agrees to it. Jane also wants to
join to the group study, but she declined because she prefers to study in a quiet
place to review her lecture notes. Mia encourages Jane that she must join them.
Besides, they will give Jane enough distance so that she will not be disturbed by
their voice. At last, Jane agrees to it because she loves to be with her friends.

                                            Points to Remember  John L. Austin (1962) espoused the Speech Act Theory, and this was developed by Searle (1969). Austin divided the speech acts into locution or the actual utterance, illocution or the real intended meaning, and perlocution or the actual effect or response.  The theory itself, therefore, tells us that words by themselves may not have simple fixed meanings, but are influenced by the situation, speaker, and listener. ActivityThrough the Years Directions: Find a couple who has been married to each other for more than twenty years. Ask them how they have managed to stay together through the years. Take note of expressions or lessons they may be sharing with you.  What quotation, expression or lesson did you learn from the couple? Explain and share your personal reaction or reflection.​</a>

                                            The learner and the learning context
An important issue in relation to the benefits of focused instruction is whether al1 learners can
equally benefit from it. Individual factors such as learner's age and cognitive characteristics, as
well as proficiency level can be seen to play a big role. As for age, while adult learners will be
able to draw on their cognitive resources to engage in explicit learning, young learners are less
likely to benefit from focus on form instruction that places too high cognitive demands on them.
Another important individual difference is the learner's (verbal) analytical abilities, which have
been found to be a good predictor of proficiency in both formal and informal settings (Harley
&amp; Hart, 1997; see also DeKeyser, 2003). Research has pointed out that learners with higher
levels of grammatical sensitivity (a component of language analytic ability) find it easier to
notice formal details of the L2 during second language acquisition (Ranta, 1998). Hence, Sawyer
and Ranta (2001) suggest that an important function of form-focused instruction may be to
compensate for learners' deficiencies in certain components of language aptitude, for example.
grammatical sensitivity.
Learners' proficiency level is also an important factor to take into consideration when
plaming focused instruction. Because research seems to show that beginning learners find it
difficult to focus on meaning and form at once (Celce-Murcia, 1991 ; Van Patten, 1990), the latter
may need to be applied with caution in the case of learners who have to struggle with basic
comprehension problems.
A not less important issue is the learning context. As Fotos (2002) argues, implicit
approaches to grammar instruction may be less appropriate in foreign language settings, where
class-time is limited and there is not enough externa1 communicative input to support continued
awareness, than in second language settings with abundant communicative input inside and
outside the classroom. In such contexts a combination of implicit and explicit approaches may
be more adequate. For example, this author (2002) proposes to incorporate implicit approaches
in lessons in which explicit instruction precedes communicative task performance. The
explanation aims at activating previously developed knowledge (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian,
1978) and facilitating the establishment of form-meaning relationships. Provision of subsequent
communicative input containing the target structure is recommended to facilitate continued
awareness of its use in context.
It is to be noted, however, that purely communicative methodology has had only
marginal impact on foreign language teaching settings, where the dominant pedagogy continues
to involve a structural syllabus or, even, grammar translation (Skehan, 1998). In such contexts,
the recent emphasis on focus on form may mislead teachers into believing that their explicit
instructional practices and analytic syllabuses is al1 learners require. Hence, the need to
emphasize the necessity to incorporate form-focused activities in communicative contexts in the
foreign language class.

If you donot properly brush your teeth and floss daily, bacteria build up around the gum line and between your teeth.This leads to decay or cavities. These bacteria can also lead to gum disease. If you do not get proper attentionto your teeth and let the decay and gum disease continue, your teeth will eventually rot and have to beremoved. The rotting teeth and gum disease will cause you to have bad breath, as well as unappealing smile;and worse, dental bacteria leads to heart disease.

                            5. ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</h2><br />

                            12. Mia decides to create a study group for the preparation of their exars. She invites
her friends Anna, Matthew, and Jane to join the said group. Anna accepts the
invitation of Mia because she likes to ask and listen to others in order to
understand a certain lesson that she didn't understand well. Also, Matthew
decides to join the study group, but he informs Mia to be patient on him because
he didn't want to just sit while studying, and Mia agrees to it. Jane also wants to
join to the group study, but she declined because she prefers to study in a quiet
place to review her lecture notes. Mia encourages Jane that she must join them.
Besides, they will give Jane enough distance so that she will not be disturbed by
their voice. At last, Jane agrees to it because she loves to be with her friends.

                            15. Points to Remember  John L. Austin (1962) espoused the Speech Act Theory, and this was developed by Searle (1969). Austin divided the speech acts into locution or the actual utterance, illocution or the real intended meaning, and perlocution or the actual effect or response.  The theory itself, therefore, tells us that words by themselves may not have simple fixed meanings, but are influenced by the situation, speaker, and listener.

                            19. The learner and the learning context
An important issue in relation to the benefits of focused instruction is whether al1 learners can
equally benefit from it. Individual factors such as learner's age and cognitive characteristics, as
well as proficiency level can be seen to play a big role. As for age, while adult learners will be
able to draw on their cognitive resources to engage in explicit learning, young learners are less
likely to benefit from focus on form instruction that places too high cognitive demands on them.
Another important individual difference is the learner's (verbal) analytical abilities, which have
been found to be a good predictor of proficiency in both formal and informal settings (Harley
&amp; Hart, 1997; see also DeKeyser, 2003). Research has pointed out that learners with higher
levels of grammatical sensitivity (a component of language analytic ability) find it easier to
notice formal details of the L2 during second language acquisition (Ranta, 1998). Hence, Sawyer
and Ranta (2001) suggest that an important function of form-focused instruction may be to
compensate for learners' deficiencies in certain components of language aptitude, for example.
grammatical sensitivity.
Learners' proficiency level is also an important factor to take into consideration when
plaming focused instruction. Because research seems to show that beginning learners find it
difficult to focus on meaning and form at once (Celce-Murcia, 1991 ; Van Patten, 1990), the latter
may need to be applied with caution in the case of learners who have to struggle with basic
comprehension problems.
A not less important issue is the learning context. As Fotos (2002) argues, implicit
approaches to grammar instruction may be less appropriate in foreign language settings, where
class-time is limited and there is not enough externa1 communicative input to support continued
awareness, than in second language settings with abundant communicative input inside and
outside the classroom. In such contexts a combination of implicit and explicit approaches may
be more adequate. For example, this author (2002) proposes to incorporate implicit approaches
in lessons in which explicit instruction precedes communicative task performance. The
explanation aims at activating previously developed knowledge (Ausubel, Novak, &amp; Hanesian,
1978) and facilitating the establishment of form-meaning relationships. Provision of subsequent
communicative input containing the target structure is recommended to facilitate continued
awareness of its use in context.
It is to be noted, however, that purely communicative methodology has had only
marginal impact on foreign language teaching settings, where the dominant pedagogy continues
to involve a structural syllabus or, even, grammar translation (Skehan, 1998). In such contexts,
the recent emphasis on focus on form may mislead teachers into believing that their explicit
instructional practices and analytic syllabuses is al1 learners require. Hence, the need to
emphasize the necessity to incorporate form-focused activities in communicative contexts in the
foreign language class.

All they need is to beloved, red and play with They love to pur near hands and feet, they are easy to train. They are great pets thatthe love and care you give them are worth what they give you in return2. Not taking proper care of your teeth can lead to many unhealthy and unappealing consequences. If you donot properly brush your teeth and floss daily, bacteria build up around the gum line and between your teeth.This leads to decay or cavities. These bacteria can also lead to gum disease. If you do not get proper attentionto your teeth and let the decay and gum disease continue, your teeth will eventually rot and have to beremoved. The rotting teeth and gum disease will cause you to have bad breath, as well as unappealing smile;and worse, dental bacteria leads to heart disease. Taking care of your teeth is not only for you to have abeautiful smile but it is important to your health.​</h2><br />
