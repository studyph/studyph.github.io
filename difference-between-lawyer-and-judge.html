But before we proceed I would like to request you to move the date for the hearing to next week as I have another case at the Supreme Court.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Judge: For that you need to submit a written request to me and to the opponent’s lawyer.</p><p></p><p>Lawyer 1: Sure my lord.

They just had a verbal fight on a trivial domestic issue.</p><p></p><p>Lawyer 2: They just had a petty argument and she got seriously injured.

Your client is an unruly man and he belongs in prison.</p><p></p><p>Judge: Order! Order! Both the lawyers settle down and maintain the decorum of court.

                        <p><strong>King: Throne:: Judge : Bench</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>In the problem above, two words are given to the first variable, the first word is "King" and the second word is "Judge". While the second variable is only given the word "Throne" as a comparison for the first variable "King". Therefore, an analysis was carried out on each variable listed in the multiple options to find the relationship between the variables as the second variable as a comparison "Judge"</p><p></p><p><strong>A. Lawyer.</strong></p><p>Judge and Lawyer are two words that are the same as stating a profession or position. Therefore, if it is associated with a variable and the first word is <strong>"King" </strong>then the appropriate word is <strong>"Queen" </strong>or <strong>"Premier"</strong>. Then we can say answer A is not valid</p><p></p><p><strong>B. Bench</strong></p><p>Bench is a position where a judge carries out his duties or more precisely like the throne of a judge. This is of course related to a King with his throne where the king sits and carries out his duties. <strong>So that the similarities between the two variables are found in this option, where the king and judge are a profession/position while the second variable is throne and bench where the first variable carries out its duties.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>C. Court </strong></p><p>The relationship between the judge and the court is the place or more precisely the location or room/building where a judge carries out his duties. If the first variable is written with the word<strong> "King"</strong>, then the second variable certainly contains the place or building where a king carries out his duties so that the correct word is<strong> "Palace" </strong>which makes answer C must be invalid.</p><p></p><p><strong>D. Trial</strong></p><p>Trial is a formal examination of evidence before a judge, and typically before a jury, in order to decide guilt in a case of criminal or civil proceedings. So if the first variable is <strong>“King”</strong> then the second variable that is more appropriate is <strong>"Royal Verdict"</strong></p><p>Learn More About :</p><p>Who is vulnerable in committing crimes, the High IQ or the Low IQ? https://brainly.ph/question/13088221</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
